			that it is popularly supposed to be. It is what everyone does when they’re not busy
			dealing with their everyday business and get a chance simply to wonder what life and the
			universe are all about. We human beings are naturally inquisitive creatures, and can’t
			help wondering about the world around us and our place in it. We’re also equipped with a
			powerful intellectual capability, which allows us to reason as well as just wonder.
			Although we may not realize it, whenever we reason, we’re thinking
			philosophically.</p><p class="calibre10">Philosophy is not so much about coming up with the answers to fundamental questions as
			it is about the process of trying to find these answers, using reasoning rather than
			accepting without question conventional views or traditional authority. The very first
			philosophers, in ancient Greece and China, were thinkers who were not satisfied with the
			established explanations provided by religion and custom, and sought answers which had
			rational justifications. And, just as we might share our views with friends and
			colleagues, they discussed their ideas with one another, and even set up “schools” to
			teach not just the conclusions they had come to, but the way they had come to them. They
			encouraged their students to disagree and criticize ideas as a means of refining them
			and coming up with new and different ones. A popular misconception is that of the
			solitary philosopher arriving at his conclusions in isolation, but this is actually
			seldom the case. New ideas emerge through discussion and the examination, analysis, and
			criticism of other people’s ideas.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"Wonder is very much the affection of a philosopher; for there is no other
				beginning of philosophy than this."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Plato</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Debate and dialogue</h2></div><p class="intro">The archetypical philosopher in this respect was Socrates. He didn’t leave any
				writings, or even any big ideas as the conclusions of his thinking. Indeed, he
				prided himself on being the wisest of men because he knew he didn’t know anything.
				His legacy lay in the tradition he established of debate and discussion, of
				questioning the assumptions of other people to gain deeper understanding and elicit
				fundamental truths. The writings of Socrates’ pupil, Plato, are almost invariably in
				the form of dialogues, with Socrates as a major character. Many later philosophers
				also adopted the device of dialogues to present their ideas, giving arguments and
				counterarguments rather than a simple statement of their reasoning and
				conclusions.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosopher who presents his ideas to the world is liable to be met with
				comments beginning “Yes, but …” or “What if …” rather than wholehearted acceptance.
				In fact, philosophers have fiercely disagreed with one another about almost every
				aspect of philosophy. Plato and his pupil Aristotle, for example, held diametrically
				opposed views on fundamental philosophical questions, and their different approaches
				have divided opinions among philosophers ever since. This has, in turn, provoked
				more discussion and prompted yet more fresh ideas.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can it be that these philosophical questions are still being discussed and
				debated? Why haven’t thinkers come up with definitive answers? What are these
				“fundamental questions” that philosophers through the ages have wrestled
				with?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-173"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000079.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Existence and knowledge</h2></div><p class="intro">When the first true philosophers appeared in ancient Greece some 2,500 years ago,
				it was the world around them that inspired their sense of wonder. They saw the Earth
				and all the different forms of life inhabiting it; the sun, moon, planets, and
				stars; and natural phenomena such as the weather, earthquakes, and eclipses. They
				sought explanations for all these things&mdash;not the traditional myths and legends about
				the gods, but something that would satisfy their curiosity and their intellect. The
				first question that occupied these early philosophers was “What is the universe made
				of?”, which was soon expanded to become the wider question of “What is the nature of
				whatever it is that exists?”</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the branch of philosophy we now call metaphysics. Although much of the
				original question has since been explained by modern science, related questions of
				metaphysics such as “Why is there something rather than nothing?” are not so simply
				answered.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we, too, exist as a part of the universe, metaphysics also considers the
				nature of human existence and what it means to be a conscious being. How do we
				perceive the world around us, and do things exist independently of our perception?
				What is the relationship between our mind and body, and is there such a thing as an
				immortal soul? The area of metaphysics concerned with questions of existence,
				ontology, is a huge one and forms the basis for much of Western philosophy.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Once philosophers had started to put received wisdom to the test of rational
				examination, another fundamental question became obvious: “How can we know?” The
				study of the nature and limits of knowledge forms a second main branch of
				philosophy, epistemology.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;At its heart is the question of how we acquire knowledge, how we come to know what
				we know; is some (or even all) knowledge innate, or do we learn everything from
				experience? Can we know something from reasoning alone? These questions are vital to
				philosophical thinking, as we need to be able to rely on our knowledge in order to
				reason correctly. We also need to determine the scope and limits of our knowledge.
				Otherwise we cannot be sure that we actually do know what we think we know, and
				haven’t somehow been “tricked” into believing it by our senses.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Voltaire</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Logic and language</h2></div><p class="intro">Reasoning relies on establishing the truth of statements, which can then be used
				to build up a train of thought leading to a conclusion. This might seem obvious to
				us now, but the idea of constructing a rational argument distinguished philosophy
				from the superstitious and religious explanations that had existed before the first
				philosophers. These thinkers had to devise a way of ensuring their ideas had
				validity. What emerged from their thinking was logic, a technique of reasoning that
				was gradually refined over time. At first simply a useful tool for analyzing whether
				an argument held water, logic developed rules and conventions, and soon became a
				field of study in its own right, another branch of the expanding subject of
				philosophy.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like so much of philosophy, logic has intimate connections with science, and
				mathematics in particular. The basic structure of a logical argument, starting from
				a premise and working through a series of steps to a conclusion, is the same as that
				of a mathematical proof. It’s not surprising then that philosophers have often
				turned to mathematics for examples of self-evident, incontrovertible truths, nor
				that many of the greatest thinkers, from Pythagoras to René Descartes and Gottfried
				Leibniz, were also accomplished mathematicians.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although logic might seem to be the most exact and “scientific” branch of
				philosophy, a field where things are either right or wrong, a closer look at the
				subject shows that it is not so simple. Advances in mathematics in the 19th century
				called into question the rules of logic that had been laid down by Aristotle, but
				even in ancient times Zeno of Elea’s famous paradoxes reached absurd conclusions
				from apparently faultless arguments.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of the problem is that philosophical logic, unlike mathematics, is
				expressed in words rather than numbers or symbols, and is subject to all the
				ambiguities and subtleties inherent in language. Constructing a reasoned argument
				involves using language carefully and accurately, examining our statements and
				arguments to make sure they mean what we think they mean; and when we study other
				people’s arguments, we have to analyze not only the logical steps they take, but
				also the language they use, to see if their conclusions hold water. Out of this
				process came yet another field of philosophy that flourished in the 20th century,
				the philosophy of language, which examined terms and their meanings.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-174"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000112.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Morality, art, and politics</h2></div><p class="intro">Because our language is imprecise, philosophers have attempted to clarify meanings
				in their search for answers to philosophical questions. The sort of questions that
				Socrates asked the citizens of Athens tried to get to the bottom of what they
				actually believed certain concepts to be. He would ask seemingly simple questions
				such as “What is justice?” or “What is beauty?” not only to elicit meanings, but
				also to explore the concepts themselves. In discussions of this sort, Socrates
				challenged assumptions about the way we live our lives and the things we consider to
				be important.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination of what it means to lead a “good” life, what concepts such as
				justice and happiness actually mean and how we can achieve them, and how we should
				behave, forms the basis for the branch of philosophy known as ethics (or moral
				philosophy); and the related branch stemming from the question of what constitutes
				beauty and art is known as aesthetics.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;From considering ethical questions about our individual lives, it is a natural
				step to start thinking about the sort of society we would like to live in&mdash;how it
				should be governed, the rights and responsibilities of its citizens, and so on.
				Political philosophy, the last of the major branches of philosophy, deals with these
				ideas, and philosophers have come up with models of how they believe society should
				be organized, ranging from Plato’s <i class="calibre12">Republic to Karl Marx’s
					Communist Manifesto</i>.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"O philosophy, life’s guide! O searcher-out of virtue and expeller of vices!

				considerably, and it is sometimes difficult to say in which area a particular idea
				falls. Philosophy also encroaches on many completely different subjects, including
				the sciences, history, and the arts. With its beginnings in questioning the dogmas
				of religion and superstition, philosophy also examines religion itself, specifically
				asking questions such as “Does god exist?” and “Do we have an immortal soul?” These
				are questions that have their roots in metaphysics, but they have implications in
				ethics too. For example, some philosophers have asked whether our morality comes
				from god or whether it is a purely human construct&mdash;and this in turn has raised the
				whole debate as to what extent humanity has free will.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Eastern philosophies that evolved in China and India (particularly Daoism
				and Buddhism) the lines between philosophy and religion are less clear, at least to
				Western ways of thinking. This marks one of the major differences between Western
				and Eastern philosophies. Although Eastern philosophies are not generally a result
				of divine revelation or religious dogma, they are often intricately linked with what
				we would consider matters of faith. Even though philosophical reasoning is
				frequently used to justify faith in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic world, faith and
				belief form an integral part of Eastern philosophy that has no parallel in the West.
				Eastern and Western philosophy also differ in their starting points. Where the
				ancient Greeks posed metaphysical questions, the first Chinese philosophers
				considered these adequately dealt with by religion, and instead concerned themselves
				with moral and political philosophy.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">William Shakespeare</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Following the reasoning</h2></div><p class="intro">Philosophy has provided us with some of the most important and influential ideas
				in history. What this book presents is a collection of ideas from the best-known
				philosophers, encapsulated in well known quotes and pithy summaries of their ideas.
				Perhaps the best-known quotation in philosophy is Descartes’ “cogito, ergo sum”
				(often translated from the Latin as “I think, therefore I am”). It ranks as one of
				the most important ideas in the history of philosophy, and is widely considered a
				turning point in thinking, leading us into the modern era. On its own however, the
				quotation doesn’t mean much. It is the conclusion of a line of argument about the
				nature of certainty, and only when we examine the reasoning leading to it does the
				idea begin to make sense. And it’s only when we see where Descartes took the
				idea&mdash;what the consequences of that conclusion are&mdash;that we see its importance.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the ideas in this book may seem puzzling at first glance. Some may appear
				self-evident, others paradoxical or flying in the face of common sense. They might
				even appear to prove Bertrand Russell’s flippant remark that “the point of
				philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to
				end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.” So why are these
				ideas important?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-176"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000059.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Systems of thought</h2></div><p class="intro">Sometimes the theories presented in this book were the first of their kind to
				appear in the history of thought. While their conclusions may seem obvious to us
				now, in hindsight, they were startlingly new in their time, and despite their
				apparent simplicity, they may make us reexamine things that we take for granted. The
				theories presented here that seem to be paradoxes and counter-intuitive statements
				are the ideas that really call into question our assumptions about ourselves and the
				world&mdash;and they also make us think in new ways about how we see things. There are
				many ideas here that raise issues that philosophers still puzzle over.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ideas may relate to other thoughts and theories in different fields of the
				same philosopher’s thinking, or have come from an analysis or criticism of another
				philosopher’s work. These latter ideas form part of a line of reasoning that may
				extend over several generations or even centuries, or be the central idea of a
				particular “school” of philosophy.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the great philosophers formed integrated “systems” of philosophy with
				interconnecting ideas. For example, their opinions about how we acquire knowledge
				led to a particular metaphysical view of the universe and man’s soul. This in turn
				has implications for what kind of life the philosopher believes we should lead and
				what type of society would be ideal. And in turn, this entire system of ideas has
				been the starting point for subsequent philosophers.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember too that these ideas never quite become outdated. They still have
				much to tell us, even when their conclusions have been proved wrong by subsequent
				philosophers and scientists. In fact, many ideas that had been dismissed for
				centuries were later to be proved startlingly prescient&mdash;the theories of the ancient
				Greek atomists for example.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, these thinkers established the processes of philosophy, ways of
				thinking and organizing our thoughts. We must remember that these ideas are only a
				small part of a philosopher’s thinking&mdash;usually the conclusion to a longer line of
				reasoning.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"Scepticism is the first step towards truth."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Denis Diderot</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Science and society</h2></div><p class="intro">These ideas spread their influence beyond philosophy too. Some have spawned
				mainstream scientific, political, or artistic movements. Often the relationship
				between science and philosophy is a back-and-forth affair, with ideas from one
				informing the other. Indeed, there is a whole branch of philosophy that studies the
				thinking behind scientific methods and practices. The development of logical
				thinking affected how math evolved and became the basis for the scientific method,
				which relies on systematic observation to explain the world. Ideas about the nature
				of the self and consciousness have developed into the science of psychology.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of philosophy’s relationship with society. Ethics of all sorts
				found adherents in political leaders throughout history, shaping the societies we
				live in today, and even prompting revolutions. The ethical decisions made in all
				kinds of professions have moral dimensions that are informed by the ideas of the
				great thinkers of philosophy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-177"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000037.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Behind the ideas</h2></div><p class="intro">The ideas in this book have come from people living in societies and cultures
				which have shaped those ideas. As we examine the ideas, we get a picture of certain
				national and regional characteristics, as well as a flavor of the times they lived
				in.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophers presented here emerge as distinct personalities&mdash;some thinkers are
				optimistic, others pessimistic; some are meticulous and painstaking, others think in
				broad sweeps; some express themselves in clear, precise language, others in a poetic
				way, and still more in dense, abstract language that takes time to unpick. If you
				read these ideas in the original texts, you will not only agree or disagree with the
				what they say, and follow the reasoning by which they reached their conclusions, but
				also get a feeling of what kind of person is behind it. You might, for example, warm
				to the witty and charming Hume, appreciating his beautifully clear prose, while not
				altogether feeling at home with what he has to say; or find Schopenhauer both
				persuasive and a delight to read, while getting the distinct feeling that he was not
				a particularly likeable man.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all these thinkers were (and still are) interesting and stimulating. The
				best were also great writers too, and reading their original writings can be as
				rewarding as reading literature; we can appreciate not just their literary style,
				but also their philosophical style, the way they present their arguments. As well as
				being thought-provoking, it can be as uplifting as great art, as elegant as a
				mathematical proof, and as witty as an after-dinner speaker.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy is not simply about ideas&mdash;it’s a way of thinking. There are frequently
				no right or wrong answers, and different philosophers often come to radically
				different conclusions in their investigations into questions that science cannot&mdash;and
				religion does not&mdash;explain.</p><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Enjoying philosophy</h2></div><p class="intro">If wonder and curiosity are human attributes, so too are the thrill of exploration
				and the joy of discovery. We can gain the same sort of “buzz” from philosophy that
				we might get from physical activity, and the same pleasure that we enjoy from an
				appreciating the arts. Above all, we gain the satisfaction of arriving at beliefs
				and ideas that are not handed down or forced upon us by society, teachers, religion,
				or even philosophers, but through our own individual reasoning.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre11">"The beginning of thought is in disagreement&mdash;not only with others but also with

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-165"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">From the beginning of human history, people have asked questions
				about the world and their place within it. For early societies, the answers to the
				most fundamental questions were found in religion: the actions of the gods explained
				the workings of the universe, and provided a framework for human
				civilizations.</p><p class="calibre13">Some people, however, found the traditional religious explanations inadequate, and
				they began to search for answers based on reason rather than convention or religion.
				This shift marked the birth of philosophy, and the first of the great thinkers that
				we know of was Thales of Miletus&mdash;Miletus was a Greek settlement in modern-day
				Turkey. Thales used reason to inquire into the nature of the universe, and
				encouraged others to do likewise. He passed on to his followers not only his
				answers, but the process of thinking rationally, together with an idea of what kind
				of explanations could be considered satisfactory. For this reason Thales is
				generally regarded as the first philosopher.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concern of the early philosophers centered around Thales’ basic question:
				“What is the world made of?” Their answers form the foundations of scientific
				thought, and forged a relationship between science and philosophy that still exists
				today. The work of Pythagoras marked a key turning point, as he sought to explain
				the world not in terms of primal matter, but in terms of mathematics. He and his
				followers described the structure of the cosmos in numbers and geometry. Although
				some of these mathematical relationships acquired mystical significance for
				Pythagoras and his followers, their numerical explanation of the cosmos had a
				profound influence on the beginnings of scientific thought.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-178"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000397.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Classical Greek philosophy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As the Greek city-states grew in stature, philosophy spread across the Greek
					world from Ionia, and in particular to Athens, which was rapidly becoming the
					cultural center of Greece. It was here that philosophers broadened the scope of
					philosophy to include new questions, such as “How do we know what we know?” and
					“How should we live our lives?” It was an Athenian, Socrates, who ushered in the
					short but hugely influential period of Classical Greek philosophy. Although he
					left no writings, his ideas were so important that they steered the future
					course of philosophy, and all philosophers before him became known as the
					pre-socratics. His pupil Plato founded a philosophical school in Athens called
					the Academy (from which the word “academic” derives) where he taught and
					developed his master’s ideas, passing them on to students such as Aristotle, who
					was a pupil and teacher there for 20 years. The contrasting ideas and methods of
					these great thinkers&mdash;Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle&mdash;form the basis of Western
					philosophy as we know it today, and their differences of opinion have continued
					to divide philosophers throughout history.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Classical period of ancient Greece effectively came to an end with the
					death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE. This great leader had unified Greece,
					and Greek city-states that had worked together once again became rivals.
					Following the death of Aristotle in 322 BCE, philosophy also divided into very
					different schools of thought, as the cynics, sceptics, epicureans, and stoics
					argued their positions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next couple of centuries, Greek culture waned as the Roman Empire
					grew. The Romans had little time for Greek philosophy apart from stoicism, but
					Greek ideas persisted, mainly because they were preserved in the manuscripts and
					translations of the Arab world. They resurfaced later, during medieval times,
					with the rise of Christianity and Islam.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Eastern philosophies</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Thinkers throughout Asia were also questioning conventional wisdom. Political
					upheaval in China from 771 to 481 BCE led to a collection of philosophies that
					were less concerned with the nature of the universe than with how best to
					organize a just society and provide moral guidelines for the individuals within
					it; in the process examining what constitutes a “good” life. The so-called
					“Hundred Schools of Thought” flourished in this period, and the most significant
					of these were Confucianism and Daoism, both of which continued to dominate
					Chinese philosophy until the 20th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To the south of China an equally influential philosopher appeared: Siddhartha
					Gautama, later known as the Buddha. From his teaching in northern India around
					500 BCE, his philosophy spread across the subcontinent and over most of southern
					Asia, where it is still widely practiced.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				the Greek peninsula gradually settled into a group of city-states. They developed an
				alphabetical system of writing, as well as the beginnings of what is now recognized
				as Western philosophy. Previous civilizations had relied on religion to explain
				phenomena in the world around them; now a new breed of thinkers emerged, who
				attempted to find natural, rational explanations.</p><p class="calibre13">The first of these new scientific thinkers that we are aware of was Thales of
				Miletus. Nothing survives of his writings, but we know that he had a good grasp of
				geometry and astronomy, and is reputed to have predicted the total eclipse of the
				sun in 585 BCE. This practical turn of mind led him to believe that events in the
				world were not due to supernatural intervention, but had natural causes that reason
				and observation would reveal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-183"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000324.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Fundamental substance</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Thales needed to establish a first principle from which to work, so he posed
					the question, “What is the basic material of the cosmos?” The idea that
					everything in the universe can be ultimately reduced to a single substance is
					the theory of monism, and Thales and his followers were the first to propose it
					within Western philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thales reasons that the fundamental material of the universe had to be
					something out of which everything else could be formed, as well as being
					essential to life, and capable of motion and therefore of change. He observes
					that water is clearly necessary to sustain all forms of life, and that it moves
					and changes, assuming different forms&mdash;from liquid to solid ice and vaporous
					mist. So Thales concludes that all matter, regardless of its apparent
					properties, must be water in some stage of transformation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thales also notes that every landmass appears to come to an end at the water’s
					edge. From this he deduces that the whole of the earth must be floating on a bed
					of water, from which it has emerged. When anything occurs to cause ripples or
					tremors in this water, Thales states, we experience them as earthquakes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as interesting as the details of Thales’ theories are, they are not
					the main reason why he is considered a major figure in the history of
					philosophy. His true importance lies in the fact that he was the first known
					thinker to seek naturalistic, rational answers to fundamental questions, rather
					than to ascribe objects and events to the whims of capricious gods. By doing so,
					he and the later philosophers of the Milesian School laid the foundations for
					future scientific and philosophical thought across the Western world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-185"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000350.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">From observation, Thales deduced that</span>

					what is now Turkey, we know very little about his life. None of his writings, if
					indeed he left any, have survived. However, his reputation as one of the key
					early Greek thinkers seems deserved, and he is referred to in some detail by
					both Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, the 3rd-century biographer of the ancient
					Greek philosophers.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests that as well as being a philosopher, Thales was
					actively involved in politics and was a very successful businessman. He is
					thought to have traveled widely around the eastern Mediterranean, and while
					visiting Egypt, to have learned the practical geometry that was to become the
					basis of his deductive reasoning.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Thales was above all a teacher, the first of the so-called Milesian

				with the business of devising strategies for ruling more effectively. The large body
				of ideas that was produced by these officials became known as the Hundred Schools of
				Thought.</p><p class="calibre13">All this coincided with the emergence of philosophy in Greece, and shared some of
				its concerns, such as seeking stability in a constantly changing world, and
				alternatives to what had previously been prescribed by religion. But Chinese
				philosophy evolved from practical politics and was therefore concerned with morality
				and ethics rather than the nature of the cosmos.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important ideas to appear at this time came from the <i class="calibre12">Daode jing</i> (<i class="calibre12">The Way and its
					Power</i>), which has been attributed to Laozi (Lao Tzu). It was one of
				the first attempts to propose a theory of just rule, based on <i class="calibre12">de</i> (virtue), which could be found by following

					it is necessary to know how the ancient Chinese viewed the ever-changing world.
					For them, the changes are cyclical, continually moving from one state to
					another, such as from night to day, summer to winter, and so on. They saw the
					different states not as opposites, but as related, one arising from the other.
					These states also possess complementary properties that together make up a
					whole. The process of change is seen as an expression of <i class="calibre12">dao, a</i>nd leads to the 10,000 manifestations that make up the
					world. Laozi, in the <i class="calibre12">Daode jing</i>, says that
					humans are merely one of these 10,000 manifestations and have no special status.
					But because of our desire and free will, we can stray from the <i class="calibre12">dao</i>, and disturb the world’s harmonious balance. To
					live a virtuous life means acting in accordance with the <i class="calibre12">dao</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the <i class="calibre12">dao</i>, however, is not a simple
					matter, as the <i class="calibre12">Daode jing</i> acknowledges.
					Philosophizing about <i class="calibre12">dao</i> is pointless, as it
					is beyond anything that humans can conceive of. It is characterized by <i class="calibre12">wu</i> (“not-being”), so we can only live according to
					the <i class="calibre12">dao</i> by <i class="calibre12">wu

				Miletus, Greece, a group of philosophers known collectively as the Milesian School
				had started to seek rational explanations for natural phenomena only a generation or
				so earlier, marking the beginning of the Western philosophical tradition. Pythagoras
				spent his childhood not far from Miletus, so it is very likely that he knew of them,
				and may even have studied in their academy. Like Thales, the founder of the Milesian
				School, Pythagoras is said to have learnt the rudiments of geometry during a trip to
				Egypt. With this background, it is not surprising that he should approach
				philosophical thinking in a scientific and mathematical way.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-197"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000142.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Pythagorean academy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Pythagoras was also, however, a deeply religious and superstitious man. He
					believed in reincarnation and the transmigration of souls, and he established a
					religious cult, with himself cast as a virtual messiah, in Croton, southern
					Italy. His disciples lived in a collective commune, following strict behavioral
					and dietary rules, while studying his religious and philosophical theories. The
					Pythagoreans, as his disciples were known, saw his ideas as mystical
					revelations, to the extent that some of the discoveries attributed to him as
					“revelations” may in fact have come from others in the community. His ideas were
					recorded by his students, who included his wife, Theano of Crotona, and
					daughters. The two sides of Pythagoras’s beliefs&mdash;the mystical and the
					scientific&mdash;seem to be irreconcilable, but Pythagoras himself does not see them
					as contradictory. For him, the goal of life is freedom from the cycle of
					reincarnation, which can be gained by adhering to a strict set of behavioral
					rules, and by contemplation, or what we would call objective scientific
					thinking. In geometry and mathematics he found truths that he regarded as
					self-evident, as if god-given, and worked out mathematical proofs that had the
					impact of divine revelation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these mathematical discoveries were a product of pure reasoning,
					Pythagoras believes they are more valuable than mere observations. For example,
					the Egyptians had discovered that a triangle whose sides have ratios of 3:4:5
					always has a right angle, and this was useful in practice, such as in
					architecture. But Pythagoras uncovered the underlying principle behind all
					right-angled triangles (that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the
					squares of the other two sides) and found it to be universally true. This
					discovery was so extraordinary, and held such potential, that the Pythagoreans
					took it to be divine revelation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pythagoras concludes that the whole cosmos must be governed by mathematical
					rules. He says that number (numerical ratios and mathematical axioms) can be
					used to explain the very structure of the cosmos. He does not totally dismiss
					the Milesian idea that the universe is made up of one fundamental substance, but
					he shifts the enquiry from substance to form.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was such a profound change in the way of looking at the world, that we
					should probably forgive Pythagoras and his disciples for getting somewhat
					carried away, and giving numbers a mystical significance. Through exploring the
					relationship between numbers and geometry, they discoved the square numbers and
					cube numbers that we speak of today, but they also attributed characteristics to
					them, such as “good” to the even numbers and “evil” to the odd ones, and even
					specifics such as “justice” to the number four, and so on. The number ten, in
					the form of the tetractys (a triangular shape made up of rows of dots) had a
					particular significance in Pythagorean ritual. Less contentiously, they saw the
					number one as a single point, a unity, from which other things could be derived.
					The number two, in this way of thinking, was a line, number three a surface or
					plane, and four a solid; the correspondence with our modern concept of
					dimensions is obvious.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pythagorean explanation of the creation of the universe followed a
					mathematical pattern: on the Unlimited (the infinite that existed before the
					universe), God imposed a Limit, so that all that exists came to have an actual
					size. In this way God created a measurable unity from which everything else was
					formed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-199"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000010.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Pythagoras’s Theorem</span> showed that shapes

					the ratios and proportions. This was reinforced by his investigations into
					music, and in particular into the relationships between notes that sounded
					pleasant together. The story goes that he first stumbled onto this idea when
					listening to blacksmiths at work. One had an anvil half the size of the other,
					and the sounds they made when hit with a hammer were exactly an octave (eight
					notes) apart. While this may be true, it was probably by experimenting with a
					plucked string that Pythagoras determined the ratios of the consonant intervals
					(the number of notes between two notes that determines whether they will sound
					harmonious if struck together). What he discovered was that these intervals were
					harmonious because the relationship between them was a precise and simple
					mathematical ratio. This series, which we now know as the harmonic series,
					confirmed for him that the elegance of the mathematics he had found in abstract
					geometry also existed in the natural world.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The stars and elements</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Pythagoras had now proved not only that the structure of the universe can be
					explained in mathemathical terms&mdash;“number is the ruler of forms”&mdash;but also that
					acoustics is an exact science, and number governs harmonious proportions. He
					then started to apply his theories to the whole cosmos, demonstrating the
					harmonic relationship of the stars, planets, and elements. His idea of harmonic
					relationships between the stars was eagerly taken up by medieval and Renaissance
					astronomers, who developed whole theories around the idea of the music of the
					spheres, and his suggestion that the elements were arranged harmoniously was
					revisited over 2,000 years after his death. In 1865 English chemist John
					Newlands discovered that when the chemical elements are arranged according to
					atomic weight, those with similar properties occur at every eighth element, like
					notes of music. This discovery became known as the Law of Octaves, and it helped
					lead to the development of the Periodic Law of chemical elements still used
					today.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pythagoras also established the principle of deductive reasoning, which is the
					step-by-step process of starting with self-evident axioms (such as “2 + 2 = 4”)
					to build toward a new conclusion or fact. Deductive reasoning was later refined
					by Euclid, and it formed the basis of mathematical thinking into medieval times
					and beyond.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Pythagoras’s most important contributions to the development of
					philosophy was the idea that abstract thinking is superior to the evidence of
					the senses. This was taken up by Plato in his theory of Forms, and resurfaced in
					the philosophical method of the rationalists in the 17th century. The
					Pythagorean attempt to combine the rational with the religious was the first
					attempt to grapple with a problem that has dogged philosophy and religion in
					some ways ever since.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everything we know about Pythagoras comes to us from others; even the
					bare facts of his life are largely conjecture. Yet he has achieved a
					near-legendary status (which he apparently encouraged) for the ideas attributed
					to him. Whether or not he was in fact the originator of these ideas does not
					really matter; what is important is their profound effect on philosophical
					thought.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-202"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000097.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Classical architecture</span> follows

					However, modern scholars believe that Pythagoras was probably born on the island
					of Samos, off the coast of modern-day Turkey. As a young man, he travelled
					widely, perhaps studying at the Milesian School, and probably visiting Egypt,
					which was a center of learning. At the age of about 40, he set up a community of
					around 300 people in Croton, southern Italy. Its members studied a mixture of
					mystical and academic studies, and despite its collective nature, Pythagoras was
					clearly the community’s leader. At the age of 60, he is said to have married a
					young girl, Theano of Crotona. Growing hostility toward the Pythagorean cult
					eventually forced him to leave Croton, and he fled to Metapontum, also in
					southern Italy, where he died soon after. His community had virtually

				lived in India during a period when religious and mythological accounts of the world
				were being questioned. In Greece, thinkers such as Pythagoras were examining the
				cosmos using reason, and in China, Laozi and Confucius were detaching ethics from
				religious dogma. Brahmanism, a religion that had evolved from Vedism&mdash;an ancient
				belief based on the sacred Veda texts&mdash;was the dominant faith in the Indian
				subcontinent in the 6th century BCE, and Siddhartha Gautama was the first to
				challenge its teachings with philosophical reasoning.</p><p class="calibre13">Gautama, although revered by Buddhists for his wisdom, was neither a messiah nor a
				prophet, and he did not act as a medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived
				at through reasoning, not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism out
				as a philosophy as much as (perhaps even more than) a religion. His quest was
				philosophical&mdash;to discover truths&mdash;and he maintained that these truths
				are available to all of us through the power of reason. Like most Eastern
				philosophers, he was not interested in the unanswerable questions of metaphysics
				that preoccupied the Greeks. Dealing with entities beyond our experience, this kind
				of enquiry was senseless speculation. Instead, he concerned himself with the
				question of the goal of life, which in turn involved examining the concepts of
				happiness, virtue, and the “good” life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-207"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000331.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The middle way</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In his early life, Gautama enjoyed luxury and, we are told, all the sensual
					pleasures. However, he realized that these were not enough on their own to bring
					him true happiness. He was acutely aware of the suffering in the world, and saw
					that it was largely due to sickness, old age, and death, and the fact that
					people lack what they need. He also recognized that the sensual pleasure we
					indulge in to relieve suffering is rarely satisfying, and that when it is, the
					effects are transitory. He found the experience of extreme asceticism (austerity
					and abstinence) equally dissatisfying, bringing him no nearer to an
					understanding of how to achieve happiness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gautama came to the conclusion that there must be a “middle way” between
					self-indulgence and self-mortification. This middle way, he believed, should
					lead to true happiness, or “enlightenment”, and to find it he applied reason to
					his own experiences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffering, he realized, is universal. It is an integral part of existence, and
					the root cause of our suffering is the frustration of our desires and
					expectations. These desires he calls “attachments”, and they include not only
					our sensual desires and worldly ambitions, but our most basic instinct for
					self-preservation. Satisfying these attachments, he argues, may bring short-term
					gratification, but not happiness in the sense of contentment and peace of
					mind.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-209"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000207.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Buddha</span> cut off his hair as part of
							his renunciation of the material world. According to Buddhist teaching,
							the temptations of the world are the source of all suffering, and must
							be resisted.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The “not-self”</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The next step in Gautama’s reasoning is that the elimination of
					attachments will prevent any disappointment, and so avoid suffering. To achieve
					this, he suggests a root cause of our attachments&mdash;our selfishness, and by
					selfishness he means more than just our tendency to seek gratification. For
					Gautama, selfishness is self-centeredness and self-attachment&mdash;the domain
					of what today we would call the “ego.” So, to free ourselves from
					attachments that cause us pain, it is not enough merely to renounce the things
					we desire&mdash;we must overcome our attachment to that which
					desires&mdash;the “self.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can this be done? Desire, ambition, and expectation are part of our
					nature, and for most of us constitute our very reasons for living. The answer,
					for Gautama, is that the ego’s world is illusory&mdash;as he shows,
					again, by a process of reasoning. He argues that nothing in the universe is
					self-caused, for everything is the result of some previous action, and each of
					us is only a transitory part of this eternal process&mdash;ultimately
					impermanent and without substance. So, in reality, there is no
					“self” that is not part of the greater whole&mdash;or the
					“not-self”&mdash;and suffering results from our failure to
					recognize this. This does not mean that we should deny our existence or personal
					identity, rather that we should understand them for what they
					are&mdash;transient and insubstantial. Grasping the concept of being a
					constituent part of an eternal “not-self”, rather than clinging to
					the notion of being a unique “self”, is the key to losing that
					attachment, and finding a release from suffering.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, unless it

					happiness is codified in Buddhist teachings in the Four Noble Truths: that
					suffering is universal; that desire is the cause of suffering; that suffering
					can be avoided by eliminating desire; that following the Eightfold Path will
					eliminate desire. This last Truth refers to what amounts to a practical guide to
					the “middle way” that Gautama laid out for his followers to achieve
					enlightenment. The Eightfold Path (right action, right intention, right
					livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right speech, right
					understanding, and right mindfulness) is in effect a code of ethics&mdash;a
					prescription for a good life and the happiness that Gautama first set out to
					find.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Peace comes from within.

					of suffering (birth, death, and rebirth) into which we are born. By following
					the Eightfold Path, a man can overcome his ego and live a life free from
					suffering, and through his enlightenment he can avoid the pain of rebirth into
					another life of suffering. He has realized his place in the “not-self”, and
					become at one with the eternal. He has attained the state of Nirvana&mdash;which is
					variously translated as “non-attachment”, “not-being”, or literally “blowing
					out” (as of a candle).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Brahmanism of Gautama’s time, and the Hindu religion that followed,
					Nirvana was seen as becoming one with god, but Gautama carefully avoids any
					mention of a deity or of an ultimate purpose to life. He merely describes
					Nirvana as “unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, and unformed”, and transcending any
					sensory experience. It is an eternal and unchanging state of not-being, and so
					the ultimate freedom from the suffering of existence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gautama spent many years after his enlightenment traveling around India,
					preaching and teaching. During his lifetime, he gained a considerable following,
					and Buddhism became established as a major religion as well as a philosophy. His
					teachings were passed down orally from generation to generation by his
					followers, until the 1st century CE, when they were written down for the first
					time. Various schools began to appear as Buddhism spread across India, and later
					spread eastward into China and Southeast Asia, where it rivalled Confucianism
					and Daoism in its popularity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gautama’s teachings spread as far as the Greek empire by the 3rd century BCE,
					but had little influence on Western philosophy. However, there were similarities
					between Gautama’s approach to philosophy and that of the Greeks, not least
					Gautama’s emphasis on reasoning as a means of finding happiness, and his
					disciples’ use of philosophical dialogues to elucidate his teachings. His
					thoughts also find echoes in the ideas of later Western philosophers, such as in
					Hume’s concept of the self and Schopenhauer’s view of the human condition. But
					it was not until the 20th century that Buddhism was to have any direct influence
					on Western thinking. Since then, more and more Westerners have turned to it for
					guidance on how to live.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"The mind is everything.

				Hundred Schools of Thought. By the 6th century BCE, the Zhou Dynasty was in
				decline&mdash;moving from the stability of the Spring and Autumn Period to the aptly named
				Warring States Period&mdash;and it was during this time that Kong Fuzi, the Master Kong,
				or Confucius, was born. Like other philosophers of the age&mdash;such as Thales,
				Pythagoras, and Heraclitus of Greece&mdash;Confucius sought constants in a world of
				change, and for him this meant a search for moral values that could enable rulers to
				govern justly.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-218"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000281.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Analects</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Unlike many of the early Chinese philosophers, Confucius looked to the past
					for his inspiration. He was conservative by nature, and had a great respect for
					ritual and ancestor worship&mdash;both of which were maintained by the Zhou Dynasty,
					whose rulers received authority from the gods via the so-called Heavenly
					Mandate.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A rigid social hierarchy existed in China, but Confucius was part of a new
					class of scholars who acted as advisors to the courts&mdash;in effect a class of civil
					servants&mdash;and they achieved their status not through inheritance, but by merit.
					It was Confucius’s integration of the old ideals with the emerging meritocracy
					that produced his unique new moral philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The main source we have for the teachings of Confucius is the <i class="calibre12">Analects</i>, a collection of fragments of his writings
					and sayings compiled by his disciples. It is primarily a political treatise,
					made up of aphorisms and anecdotes that form a sort of rule book for good
					government&mdash;but his use of the word <i class="calibre12">junzi</i>
					(literally “gentleman”) to denote a superior, virtuous man, indicates that his
					concerns were as much social as political. Indeed, many passages of the
						<i class="calibre12">Analects</i> read like a book of etiquette.
					But to see the <i class="calibre12">Analects</i> as merely a social or
					political treatise is to miss its central point. At its heart lies a
					comprehensive ethical system.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he
						does not desire to go beyond this."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Confucius</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The virtuous life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Before the appearance of the Hundred Schools of Thought, the world had been
					explained by mythology and religion, and power and moral authority were
					generally accepted to be god-given. Confucius is pointedly silent about the
					gods, but he often refers to <i class="calibre12">tian</i>, or Heaven,
					as the source of moral order. According to the <i class="calibre12">Analects</i>, we humans are the agents that Heaven has chosen to
					embody its will and to unite the world with the moral order&mdash;an idea that was in
					line with traditional Chinese thinking. What breaks with tradition, however, is
					Confucius’s belief that <i class="calibre12">de</i>&mdash;virtue&mdash;is not
					something Heaven-sent for the ruling classes, but something that can be
					cultivated&mdash;and cultivated by anyone. Having himself risen to be a minister of
					the Zhou court, he believed that it was a duty of the middle classes, as well as
					the rulers, to strive to act with virtue and benevolence (<i class="calibre12">ren</i>) to achieve a just and stable society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To reconcile the fact that society was a rigid class system with his belief
					that all men can receive the blessing of the Heavenly Mandate, Confucius argues
					that the virtuous man is not simply one who stands at the top of the social
					hierarchy, but one who understands his place within that hierarchy and embraces
					it to the full. And to define the various means of acting in accordance with
						<i class="calibre12">de</i>&mdash;virtue&mdash;he turns to traditional Chinese
					values: <i class="calibre12">zhong</i>, loyalty; <i class="calibre12">xiao</i>, filial piety; <i class="calibre12">li</i>, ritual propriety; and <i class="calibre12">shu</i>, reciprocity. The person who sincerely observes these values
					Confucius called <i class="calibre12">junzi</i>, the gentleman or
					superior man, by which he means a man of virtue, learning, and good
					manners.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The values of <i class="calibre12">de</i> had evolved within the
					ruling classes but had become little more than empty gestures in the
					disintegrating world of the Zhou Dynasty. Confucius is attempting persuade the
					rulers to return to these ideals and to restore a just government, but he also
					believes in the power of benevolence&mdash;arguing that ruling by example rather than
					by fear would inspire the people to follow a similarly virtuous life. The same
					principle, he believes, should govern personal relationships.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-221"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000255.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Loyalty and ritual</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In his analysis of relationships, Confucius uses <i class="calibre12">zhong</i>&mdash;the virtue of loyalty&mdash;as a guiding principle. To begin
					with, he stresses the importance of the loyalty of a minister to his sovereign,
					then shows that a similar relation holds between father and son, husband and
					wife, elder brother and younger brother, and between friends. The order in which
					he arranges these is significant&mdash;political loyalty first, then family and clan
					loyalties, then loyalties to friends and strangers. For Confucius, this
					hierarchy reflects the fact that each person should know his station in society
					as a whole, as well his place in the family and the clan.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect of “knowing one’s station” is exemplified by <i class="calibre12">xiao</i>&mdash;filial piety&mdash;which for Confucius was much more
					than just respect for one’s parents or elders. In fact, this is the closest he
					gets to religious ideas in the <i class="calibre12">Analects</i>, for
						<i class="calibre12">xiao</i> is connected to the traditional
					practice of ancestor worship. Above all, <i class="calibre12">xiao</i>
					reinforced the relationship of inferior to superior, which was central to his
					thinking.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in his insistence on <i class="calibre12">li&mdash;</i>ritual
					propriety&mdash;that Confucius is at his most conservative. <i class="calibre12">Li</i> did not simply refer to rituals such as ancestor worship, but
					also to the social norms that underpinned every aspect of contemporary Chinese
					life. These ranged from ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, and sacrifices
					to the etiquette of receiving guests, presenting gifts, and the simple, everyday
					gestures of politeness, such as bowing and using the correct mode of address.
					These are, according to Confucius, the outward signs of an inner <i class="calibre12">de</i>&mdash;but only when they are performed with sincerity,
					which he considers to be the way of Heaven. Through the outward show of loyalty
					with inner sincerity, the superior man can transform society.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-223"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000225.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Ritual and tradition</span>, for Confucius,
							are vital for binding an individual to his community. By knowing his
							place in society, the individual is free to become <i class="calibre20">junzi</i>, a man of virtue.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Sincerity</h2></div><p class="calibre14">For Confucius, society can be changed by example. As he writes: “Sincerity
					becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest,
					it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are
					changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. Only he who is possessed of
					the most complete sincerity that can exist under Heaven, can transform.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Confucius is at his least conservative, and he explains that the process
					of transformation can work both ways. The concept of <i class="calibre12">zhong</i> (faithfulness) also has an implication of “regard for
					others.” He took the view that one can learn to become a superior man by first
					recognizing what one does not know (an idea echoed a century later by the Greek
					philosopher Socrates, who claimed that his wisdom lay in accepting that he knew
					nothing), and then by watching other people: if they show virtue, try to become
					their equal; if they are inferior, be their guide.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"What you know, you know; what you don’t know, you don’t know. This is true
						wisdom."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Confucius</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Self-reflection</h2></div><p class="calibre14">This notion of <i class="calibre12">zhong</i> as a regard for others
					is also tied to the last of the Confucian values of <i class="calibre12">de</i>: <i class="calibre12">shu</i>, reciprocity, or
					“self-reflection”, which should govern our actions toward others. The so-called
					Golden Rule, “do as you would be done by”, appears in Confucianism as a
					negative: “what you do not desire for yourself, do not do to others.” The
					difference is subtle but crucial: Confucius does not prescribe what to do, only
					what not to do, emphasizing restraint rather than action. This implies modesty
					and humility&mdash;values traditionally held in high regard in Chinese society, and
					which for Confucius express our true nature. Fostering these values is a form of
					loyalty to oneself, and another kind of sincerity.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Confucianism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Confucius had little success in persuading contemporary rulers to adopt his
					ideas in government, and turned his attention to teaching. His disciples,
					including Meng Zi (Mencius), continued to anthologize and expand on his
					writings, which survived the repressive Qin Dynasty, and inspired a revival of
					Confucianism in the Han Dynasty of the early Common Era. From then on, the
					impact of Confucius’s ideas was profound, inspiring almost every aspect of
					Chinese society, from administration to politics and philosophy. The major
					religions of Daoism and Buddhism had also been flourishing in Confucius’s time,
					replacing traditional beliefs, and although Confucius offered no opinion on
					them, remaining silent about the gods, he nevertheless influenced aspects of
					both new faiths.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A Neo-Confucian school revitalized the movement in the 9th century, and
					reached its peak in the 12th century, when its influence was felt across
					Southeast Asia into Korea and Japan. Although Jesuit missionaries brought back
					Kong Fuzi’s ideas to Europe (and Latinized his name to Confucius) in the 16th
					century, Confucianism was alien to European thought and had limited influence
					until translations of his work appeared in the late 17th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fall of imperial China in 1911, Confucian ideas continued to form
					the basis of many Chinese moral and social conventions, even if they were
					officially frowned upon. In recent years the People’s Republic of China has
					shown a renewed interest in Confucius, integrating his ideas with both modern
					Chinese thought and Western philosophy, creating a hybrid philosophy known as
					“New Confucianism.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-227"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000204.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Confucius’s devotion</span> to the idea of

				Heraclitus considers the logos to be a universal, cosmic law, according to which all
				things come into being, and by which all the material elements of the universe are
				held in balance.</p><p class="calibre13">It is the balancing of opposites, such as day and night and hot and cold, which
				Heraclitus believes leads to the unity of the universe, or the idea everything is
				part of a single fundamental process or substance&mdash;the central tenet of monism. But
				he also states that tension is constantly generated between these pairs of
				opposites, and he therefore concludes that everything must be in a permanent state
				of flux, or change. Day, for instance, changes into night, which in turn changes
				back again to day.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heraclitus offers the example of a river to illustrate his theory: “You can never
				step into the same river twice.” By this, he means that at the very moment you step
				into a river, fresh waters will immediately replace those into which you initially
				placed your foot, and yet the river itself is always described as one fixed and
				unchanging thing.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heraclitus’s belief that every object in the universe is in a state of constant
				flux runs counter to the thinking of the philosophers of the Milesian school, such
				as Thales and Anaximenes, who define all things by their quintessentially unchanging

				philosophy. Influenced by the logical, scientific thinking of Pythagoras, Parmenides
				employs deductive reasoning in an attempt to uncover the true physical nature of the
				world. His investigations lead him to take the opposite view to that of
				Heraclitus.</p><p class="calibre13">From the premise that something exists (“It is”), Parmenides deduces that it
				cannot also not exist (“It is not”), as this would involve a logical contradiction.
				It follows therefore that a state of nothing existing is impossible&mdash;there can be no
				void. Something cannot then come from nothing, and so must always have existed in
				some form. This permanent form cannot change, because something that is permanent
				cannot change into something else without it ceasing to be permanent. Fundamental
				change is therefore impossible.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Parmenides concludes from this pattern of thought that everything that is real
				must be eternal and unchanging, and must have an indivisible unity&mdash;“all is one.”
				More importantly for subsequent philosophers, Parmenides shows by his process of
				reasoning that our perception of the world is faulty and full of contradictions. We
				seem to experience change, and yet our reason tells us that change is impossible.
				The only conclusion we can come to is that we can never rely on the experience that
				is delivered to us by our senses.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-234"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000102.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Understanding the cosmos</span> is one of the

				a “Golden Age” of scholarship and culture. This attracted people from all parts of

				to be had. The city was run on broadly democratic principles, with an established
				legal system. Anyone taken to court was required to plead his own case; there were
				no advocates, but a recognized class of advisors soon evolved. Among this group was
				Protagoras.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-237"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000047.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Everything is relative</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Protagoras lectured in law and rhetoric to anybody who could afford him. His
					teachings were essentially about practical matters, arguing to win a civil case
					rather than to prove a point, but he could see the philosophical implications of
					what he taught. For Protagoras, every argument has two sides, and both may be
					equally valid. He claims that he can “make the worse case the better”, proving
					not the worth of the argument, but the persuasiveness of its proponent. In this
					way, he recognizes that belief is subjective, and it is the man holding the view
					or opinion that is the measure of its worth. This style of reasoning, common in
					law and politics at that time, was new to philosophy. By placing human beings at
					its center, it continued a tradition of taking religion out of philosophical
					argument, and it also shifted the focus of philosophy away from an understanding
					of the nature of the universe to an examination of human behavior. Protagoras is
					mainly interested in practical questions. Philosophical speculations on the
					substance of the cosmos or about the existence of the gods seem pointless to
					him, as he considers such things to be ultimately unknowable.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The main implication of “man is the measure of all things” is that belief is
					subjective and relative. This leads Protagoras to reject the existence of
					absolute definitions of truth, justice, or virtue. What is true for one person
					may be false for another, he claims. This relativism also applies to moral

				that interested him, and in doing so evolved a new way of thinking, or a new way of
				examining what we think. This has been called the Socratic, or dialectical, method
				(“dialectical” because it proceeds as a dialogue between opposing views), and it
				earned him many enemies in Athens, where he lived. He was vilified as a Sophist
				(someone who argues for the sake of deception), and was sentenced to death on
				charges of corrupting the young with ideas that undermined tradition. But he also
				had many followers, and among them was Plato, who recorded Socrates’ ideas in a
				series of written works, called dialogues, in which Socrates sets about examining
				various ideas. It is largely thanks to these dialogues&mdash;which include the <i class="calibre12">Apology</i>, <i class="calibre12">Phaedo,</i> and
				the <i class="calibre12">Symposium</i>&mdash;that Socrates’ thought survived at
				all, and that it went on to guide the course of Western philosophy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-250"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000289.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The purpose of life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Socrates lived in Athens in the second half of the 5th century BCE. As a young
					man he is believed to have studied natural philosophy, looking at the various
					explanations of the nature of the universe, but then became involved in the
					politics of the city-state and concerned with more down-to-earth ethical issues,
					such as the nature of justice. However, he was not interested in winning
					arguments, or arguing for the sake of making money&mdash;a charge that was leveled at
					many of his contemporaries. Nor was he seeking answers or explanations&mdash;he was
					simply examining the basis of the concepts we apply to ourselves (such as
					“good”, “bad”, and “just”), for he believed that understanding what we are is
					the first task of philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Socrates’ central concern, then, was the examination of life, and it was his
					ruthless questioning of people’s most cherished beliefs (largely about
					themselves) that earned him his enemies&mdash;but he remained committed to his task
					until the very end. According to the account of his defence at his trial,
					recorded by Plato, Socrates chose death rather than face a life of ignorance:
					“The life which is unexamined is not worth living.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But what exactly is involved in this examination of life? For Socrates it was
					a process of questioning the meaning of essential concepts that we use every day
					but have never really thought about, thereby revealing their real meaning and
					our own knowledge or ignorance. Socrates was one of the first philosophers to
					consider what it was that constituted a “good” life; for him it meant achieving
					peace of mind as a result of doing the right thing, rather than living according
					to the moral codes of society. And the “right thing” can only be determined
					through rigorous examination.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Socrates rejected the notion that concepts such as virtue were relative,
					insisting instead that they were absolutes, applicable not just to citizens of
					Athens, or Greece, but to all people in the world. He believed that virtue
						(<i class="calibre12">areté</i> in Greek, which at the time
					implied excellence and fulfilment) was “the most valuable of possessions”, and
					that no-one actually desires to do evil. Anyone performing evil actions would be
					acting against their conscience and would therefore feel uncomfortable; and as
					we all strive for peace of mind it is not something we would do willingly. Evil,
					he thought, was done because of lack of wisdom and knowledge. From this he
					concluded that “there is only one good: knowledge; and one evil: ignorance.”
					Knowledge is inextricably bound to morality&mdash;it is the “only one good”&mdash;and for
					this reason we must continually “examine” our lives.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"I am a citizen of the world."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Socrates</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-252"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000260.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Socrates’ dialectical method</span> was a

						<i class="calibre12">Apology</i>, Plato’s Socrates prefaces his
					famous quote about the unexamined life by saying: “I tell you that to let no day
					pass without discussing goodness and all the other subjects about which you hear
					me talking, and that examining both myself and others is really the very best
					thing a man can do.” This gaining of knowledge, rather than wealth or high
					status, is the ultimate goal of life. It is not a matter of entertainment or
					curiosity&mdash;it is the reason why we exist. Moreover, all knowledge is ultimately
					self-knowledge, for it creates the person you are within this world, and fosters
					the care of the immortal soul.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i class="calibre12">Phaedo</i>, Socrates says that an unexamined
					life leads the soul to be “confused and dizzy, as if it were drunk”, while the
					wise soul achieves stability, its straying finally brought to an end.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-254" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dialectical method</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Socrates quickly became a well-known figure in Athens, with a reputation for
					an enquiring mind. A friend of his, so the story goes, asked the priestess of
					Apollo at Delphi who the wisest man in the world was: the oracular reply was
					that there was no-one wiser than Socrates. When Socrates heard about this, he
					was astounded, and went to the most knowledgeable people he could find to try to
					disprove it. What he discovered was that these people only thought they knew a
					great deal; under examination, their knowledge was proved to be either limited
					or false.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What was more important, however, was the method he used to question their
					knowledge. He took the standpoint of someone who knew nothing, and merely asked
					questions, exposing contradictions in arguments and gaps in knowledge to
					gradually elicit insights. He likened the process to his mother’s profession of
					midwife, assisting in the birth of ideas.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these discussions, Socrates came to realize that the Delphic oracle
					had been right&mdash;he was the wisest man in Athens, not because of his knowledge but
					because he professed to know nothing. He also saw that the inscription on the
					entrance to the temple at Delphi, <i class="calibre12">gnothi
						seauton</i> (“know thyself”), was just as significant. To gain
					knowledge of the world and oneself it was necessary to realize the limits of
					one’s own ignorance and to remove all preconceptions. Only then could one hope
					to determine the truth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Socrates set about engaging the people of Athens in discussion on topics such
					as the nature of love, justice, and loyalty. His mission, misunderstood at the
					time as a dangerous form of Sophistry&mdash;or cleverness for the sake of it&mdash;was not
					to instruct the people, nor even simply to learn what they knew, but to explore
					the ideas that they had. It was the conversation itself, with Socrates guiding
					it, that provided him with insights. Through a series of questions, he revealed
					the ideas and assumptions his opponent held, then exposed the contradictions
					within them and brought them to agree to a new set of conclusions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of examining an argument by rational discussion from a position of
					ignorance marked a complete change in philosophical thinking. It was the first
					known use of inductive argument, in which a set of premises based on experience
					is first established to be true, and then shown to lead to a universal truth in
					conclusion. This powerful form of argument was developed by Aristotle, and later
					by Francis Bacon, who used it as the starting point of his scientific method. It
					became, therefore, the foundation not only of Western philosophy, but of all the
					empirical sciences.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Socrates</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-255"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000230.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Socrates was put to death</span> in 399 BCE,

				had left no writings, and Plato took it upon himself to preserve what he had learnt
				from his master for posterity&mdash;first in the <i class="calibre12">Apology</i>, his retelling of Socrates’ defense at his trial, and later
				by using Socrates as a character in a series of dialogues. In these dialogues, it is
				sometimes difficult to untangle which are Socrates’ thoughts and which are the
				original thoughts of Plato, but a picture emerges of Plato using the methods of his
				master to explore and explain his own ideas.</p><p class="calibre13">Initially Plato’s concerns were very much those of his mentor: to search for
				definitions of abstract moral values such as “justice” and “virtue”, and to refute
				Protagoras’s notion that right and wrong are relative terms. In the <i class="calibre12">Republic</i>, Plato set out his vision of the ideal
				city-state and explored aspects of virtue. But in the process, he also tackled
				subjects outside moral philosophy. Like earlier Greek thinkers, he questioned the
				nature and substance of the cosmos, and explored how the immutable and eternal could
				exist in a seemingly changing world. However, unlike his predecessors, Plato
				concluded that the “unchanging” in nature is the same as the “unchanging” in morals
				and society.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-260"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000162.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-261" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Seeking the Ideal</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the <i class="calibre12">Republic</i>, Plato describes Socrates
					posing questions about the virtues, or moral concepts, in order to establish
					clear and precise definitions of them. Socrates had famously said that “virtue
					is knowledge”, and that to act justly, for example, you must first ask what
					justice is. Plato decides that before referring to any moral concept in our
					thinking or reasoning, we must first explore both what we mean by that concept
					and what makes it precisely the kind of thing that it is. He raises the question
					of how we would recognize the correct, or perfect, form of anything&mdash;a form that
					is true for all societies and for all time. By doing so, Plato is implying that
					he thinks some kind of ideal form of things in the world we inhabit&mdash;whether
					those things are moral concepts or physical objects&mdash;must actually exist, of
					which we are in some way aware.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plato talks about objects in the world around us, such as beds. When we see a
					bed, he states, we know that it is a bed and we can recognize all beds, even
					though they may differ in numerous ways. Dogs in their many species are even
					more varied, yet all dogs share the characteristic of “dogginess”, which is
					something we can recognize, and that allows us to say we know what a dog is.
					Plato argues that it is not just that a shared “dogginess” or “bedness” exists,
					but that we all have in our minds an idea of an ideal bed or dog, which we use
					to recognize any particular instance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a mathematical example to further his argument, Plato shows that true
					knowledge is reached by reasoning, rather than through our senses. He states
					that we can work out in logical steps that the square of the hypotenuse of a
					right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides,
					or that the sum of the three interior angles of any triangle is always 180
					degrees. We know the truth of these statements, even though the perfect triangle
					does not exist anywhere in the natural world. Yet we are able to perceive the
					perfect triangle&mdash;or the perfect straight line or circle&mdash;in our minds, using our
					reason. Plato, therefore, asks whether such perfect forms can exist
					anywhere.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">World of Ideas</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Reasoning brings Plato to only one conclusion&mdash;that there must be a world of
					Ideas, or Forms, which is totally separate from the material world. It is there
					that the Idea of the perfect “triangle”, along with the Idea of the perfect
					“bed” and “dog” exists. He concludes that human senses cannot perceive this
					place directly&mdash;it is only perceptible to us through reason. Plato even goes on
					to state that this realm of Ideas is “reality”, and that the world around us is
					merely modelled upon it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate his theory, Plato presents what has become known as the
					“Allegory of the Cave.” He asks us to imagine a cave in which people have been
					imprisoned since birth, tied up facing the back wall in the darkness. They can
					only face straight ahead. Behind the prisoners is a bright fire, which casts
					shadows onto the wall they are facing. There is also a rampart between the fire
					and the prisoners along which people walk and hold up various objects from time
					to time, so that the shadows of these objects are cast on the wall. These
					shadows are all the prisoners know of the world; they have no concept of the
					actual objects themselves. If one of the prisoners manages to untie himself and
					turn around, he will see the objects themselves. But after a lifetime of
					entrapment, he is likely to be confused, as well as dazzled by the fire, and
					will most likely turn back toward the wall and the only reality he knows.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plato believes that everything that our senses perceive in the material world
					is like the images on the cave wall, merely shadows of reality. This belief is
					the basis of his theory of Forms, which is that for every earthly thing that we
					have the power to perceive with our senses, there is a corresponding “Form” (or
					“Idea”)&mdash;an eternal and perfect reality of that thing&mdash;in the world of Ideas.
					Because what we perceive via our senses is based on an experience of imperfect
					or incomplete “shadows” of reality, we can have no real knowledge of those
					things. At best, we may have opinions, but genuine knowledge can only come from
					study of the Ideas, and that can only ever be achieved through reason, rather
					than through our deceptive senses.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This separation of two distinct worlds, one of appearance, the other of what
					Plato considers to be reality, also solves the problem of finding constants in
					an apparently changing world. The material world may be subject to change, but
					Plato’s world of Ideas is eternal and immutable. Plato applies his theory not
					just to concrete things, such as beds and dogs, but also to abstract concepts.
					In Plato’s world of Ideas, there is an Idea of justice, which is true justice,
					and all the instances of justice in the material world around us are models, or
					lesser variants, of it. The same is true of the concept of goodness, which Plato
					considers to be the ultimate Idea&mdash;and the goal of all philosophical
					enquiry.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"If particulars are to have meaning, there must be universals."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Plato</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-263"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000135.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Allegory of the Cave</span>, in which

					the ability to recognize the imperfect instances of them in the world we
					inhabit. Plato argues that our conception of Ideal Forms must be innate, even if
					we are not aware of this. He believes that human beings are divided into two
					parts: the body and the soul. Our bodies possess the senses, through which we
					are able to perceive the material world, while the soul possesses the reason
					with which we can perceive the realm of Ideas. Plato concludes that our soul,
					which is immortal and eternal, must have inhabited the world of Ideas before our
					birth, and still yearns to return to that realm after our death. So when we see
					variations of the Ideas in the world with our senses, we recognize them as a
					sort of recollection. Recalling the innate memories of these Ideas requires
					reason&mdash;an attribute of the soul.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Plato, the philosopher’s job is to use reason to discover the Ideal Forms
					or Ideas. In the <i class="calibre12">Republic</i>, he also argues
					that it is philosophers, or rather those who are true to the philosopher’s
					calling, who should be the ruling class. This is because only the true
					philosopher can understand the exact nature of the world and the truth of moral
					values. However, just like a prisoner in the “Allegory of the Cave” who sees the
					real objects rather than their shadows, many will just turn back to the only
					world they feel comfortable with. Plato often found it difficult to convince his
					fellow philosophers of the true nature of their calling.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"The soul of man is immortal and imperishable."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Plato</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-266"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000080.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Marcus Aurelius</span>, Roman Emperor from 161

					path to knowledge itself. He was a profound influence on his pupil
					Aristotle&mdash;even if they fundamentally disagreed about the theory of Forms.
					Plato’s ideas later found their way into the philosophy of medieval Islamic and
					Christian thinkers, including St. Augustine of Hippo, who combined Plato’s ideas
					with those of the Church.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By proposing that the use of reason, rather than observation, is the only way
					to acquire knowledge, Plato also laid the foundations of 17th-century

				Academy under the great philosopher Plato. Plato himself was 60 at the time, and had
				already devised his theory of Forms. According to this theory, all earthly
				phenomena, such as justice and the color green, are shadows of ideal counterparts,
				called Forms, which give their earthly models their particular identities.</p><p class="calibre13">Aristotle was a studious type, and no doubt learnt a great deal from his master,
				but he was also of a very different temperament. Where Plato was brilliant and
				intuitive, Aristotle was scholarly and methodical. Nevertheless, there was an
				obvious mutual respect, and Aristotle stayed at the Academy, both as a student and a
				teacher, until Plato died 20 years later. Surprisingly, he was not chosen as Plato’s
				successor, and so he left Athens and took what would prove to be a fruitful trip to
				Ionia.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-272"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000364.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Plato’s theory questioned</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The break from teaching gave Aristotle the opportunity to indulge his passion
					for studying wildlife, which intensified his feeling that Plato’s theory of
					Forms was wrong. It is tempting to imagine that Aristotle’s arguments had
					already had some influence on Plato, who in his later dialogues admitted some
					flaws in his earlier theories, but it is impossible to know for certain. We do
					know, though, that Plato was aware of the Third Man argument, which Aristotle
					used to refute his theory of Forms. This argument runs as follows: if there
					exists in a realm of Forms a perfect Form of Man on which earthly men are
					modelled, this Form, to have any conceivable content, would have to be based on
					a Form of the Form of Man&mdash;and this too would have to be based on a higher
					Form on which the Forms of the Forms are based, and so on <i class="calibre12">ad infinitum</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle’s later argument against the theory of Forms was more
					straightforward, and more directly related to his studies of the natural world.
					He realized that it was simply unnecessary to assume that there is a
					hypothetical realm of Forms, when the reality of things can already be seen here
					on Earth, inherent in everyday things.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because his father had been a physician, Aristotle’s scientific
					interests lay in what we now call the biological sciences, whereas Plato’s
					background had been firmly based in mathematics. This difference in background
					helps to explain the difference in approach between the two men. Mathematics,
					especially geometry, deals with abstract concepts that are far removed from the
					everyday world, whereas biology is very much about the world around us, and is
					based almost solely on observation. Plato sought confirmation of a realm of
					Forms from notions such as the perfect circle (which cannot exist in nature),
					but Aristotle found that certain constants can be discovered by examining the
					natural world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-274"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000376.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Plato and Aristotle</span> differed in their
							opinion of the nature of universal qualities. For Plato, they reside in
							the higher realm of the Forms, but for Aristotle they reside here on
							Earth.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Trusting the senses</h2></div><p class="calibre14">What Aristotle proposed turned Plato’s theory on its head. Far from
					mistrusting our senses, Aristotle relied on them for the evidence to back up his
					theories. What he learnt from studying the natural world was that by observing
					the characteristics of every example of a particular plant or animal that he
					came across, he could build up a complete picture of what it was that
					distinguished it from other plants or animals, and deduce what makes it what it
					is. His own studies confirmed what he already believed&mdash;that we are not
					born with an innate ability to recognize Forms, as Plato maintained.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time a child comes across a dog, for example, it notes what it is about
					that animal that it has in common with other dogs, so that it can eventually
					recognize the things that make something a dog. The child now has an idea of
					“dogginess”, or the “form”, as Aristotle puts it, of a dog. In this way, we
					learn from our experience of the world what the shared characteristics are that
					make things what they are&mdash;and the only way of experiencing the world is
					through our senses.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Everything that depends on the action of nature is by nature as good as it
						can be."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aristotle</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-276" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The essential form of things</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Like Plato, then, Aristotle is concerned with finding some kind of immutable
					and eternal bedrock in a world characterized by change, but he concludes that
					there is no need to look for this anchor in a world of Forms that are only
					perceptible to the soul. The evidence is here in the world around us,
					perceptible through the senses. Aristotle believes that things in the material
					world are not imperfect copies of some ideal Form of themselves, but that the
					essential form of a thing is actually inherent in each instance of that thing.
					For example, “dogginess” is not just a shared characteristic of dogs&mdash;it is
					something that is inherent in each and every dog.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By studying particular things, therefore, we can gain insight into their
					universal, immutable nature.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is true of examples in the natural world, Aristotle reasons, is also true
					of concepts relating to human beings. Notions such as “virtue”, “justice”,
					“beauty”, and “good” can be examined in exactly the same way. As he sees it,
					when we are born our minds are like “unscribed tablets”, and any ideas that we
					gain can only be received through our senses. At birth, we have no innate ideas,
					so we can have no idea of right or wrong. As we encounter instances of justice
					throughout our lives, however, we learn to recognize the qualities that these
					instances have in common, and slowly build and refine our understanding of what
					justice is. In other words, the only way we can come to know the eternal,
					immutable idea of justice, is by observing how it is manifested in the world
					around us.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle departs from Plato, then, not by denying that universal qualities
					exist, but by questioning both their nature and the means by which we come to
					know them (the latter being the fundamental quesion of “epistemology”, or the
					theory of knowledge). And it was this difference of opinion on how we arrive at
					universal truths that later divided philosophers into two separate camps: the
					rationalists (including René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, and Gottfried Leibniz),
					who believe in <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>, or innate,
					knowledge; and the empiricists (including John Locke, George Berkeley, and David
					Hume), who claim that all knowledge comes from experience.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-277"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000365.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Aristotle classified</span> many of the
							different strands of knowledge and learning that we have today, such as

							biology.</p></div></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"All men by nature desire to know."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aristotle</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Biological classification</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The manner in which Plato and Aristotle arrive at their theories tells us much
					about their temperaments. Plato’s theory of Forms is grand and otherworldly,
					which is reflected in the way he argues his case, using highly imaginative
					fictionalized dialogues between Socrates and his contemporaries. By contrast,
					Aristotle’s theory is much more down to earth, and is presented in more prosaic,
					academic language. Indeed, so convinced was Aristotle that the truth of the
					world is to be found here on Earth, and not in some higher dimension, that he
					set about collecting specimens of flora and fauna, and classified them according
					to their characteristics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For this biological classification, Aristotle devised a hierarchical
					system&mdash;the first of its kind, and so beautifully constructed that it forms the
					basis of the taxonomy still in use today. First, he divides the natural world
					into living and non-living things, then he turns his attention to classifying
					the living world. His next division is between plants and animals, which
					involves the same kind of thinking that underpins his theory of universal
					qualities: we may be able to distinguish between a plant and an animal almost
					without thinking, but how do we know how to make that distinction? The answer,
					for Aristotle, is in the shared features of either category. All plants share
					the form “plant”, and all animals share the form
					“animal.” And once we understand the nature of those forms, we can
					then recognize them in each and every instance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact becomes more apparent the more Aristotle subdivides the natural
					world. In order to classify a specimen as a fish, for example, we have to
					recognize what it is that makes a fish a fish&mdash;which, again, can be known through
					experience and requires no innate knowledge at all. As Aristotle builds up a
					complete classification of all living things, from the simplest organisms to
					human beings, this fact is confirmed again and again.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Teleological explanation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Another fact that became obvious to Aristotle as he classified the natural
					world is that the “form” of a creature is not just a matter of its physical
					characteristics, such as its skin, fur, feather, or scales, but also a matter of
					what it does, and how it behaves&mdash;which, for Aristotle, has ethical
					implications.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand the link with ethics, we need first to appreciate that for
					Aristotle everything in the world is fully explained by four causes that fully
					account for a thing’s existence. These four causes are: the material cause, or
					what a thing is made of; the formal cause, or the arrangement or shape of a
					thing; the efficient cause, or how a thing is brought into being; and the final
					cause, or the function or purpose of a thing. And it is this last type of cause,
					the “final cause”, that relates to ethics&mdash;a subject which, for Aristotle, is not
					separate from science, but rather a logical extension of biology.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;An example that Aristotle gives is that of an eye: the final cause of an
					eye&mdash;its function&mdash;is to see. This function is the purpose, or <i class="calibre12">telos</i>, of the eye&mdash;<i class="calibre12">telos</i> is a Greek word that gives us “teleology”, or the study of
					purpose in nature. A teleological explanation of a thing is therefore an account
					of a thing’s purpose, and to know the purpose of a thing is also to know what a
					“good” or a “bad” version of a thing is&mdash;a good eye for example, is one that sees
					well.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of humans, a “good” life is therefore one in which we fulfill our
					purpose, or use all the characteristics that make us human to the full. A person
					can be considered “good” if he uses the characteristics he was born with, and
					can only be happy by using all his capabilities in the pursuit of virtue&mdash;the
					highest form of which, for Aristotle, is wisdom. Which brings us full circle
					back to the question of how we can recognize the thing that we call virtue&mdash;and
					for Aristotle, again, the answer is by observation. We understand the nature of
					the “good life” by seeing it in the people around us.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-280"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000341.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Aristotle’s classification of living
								things</span> is the first detailed examination of the natural
							world. It proceeds from general observations about the characteristics
							shared by all animals, and then subdivides into ever more precise
							categories.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The syllogism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the process of classification, Aristotle formulates a systematic form of
					logic which he applies to each specimen to determine whether it belongs to a
					certain category. For example, one of the characteristics common to all reptiles
					is that they are cold-blooded; so, if this particular specimen is warm-blooded,
					then it cannot be a reptile. Likewise, a characteristic common to all mammals is
					that they suckle their young; so, if this specimen is a mammal, it will suckle
					its young. Aristotle sees a pattern in this way of thinking&mdash;that of three
					propositions consisting of two premises and a conclusion, for example in the
					form: if As are Xs, and B is an A, then B is an X. The “syllogism”, as this form
					of reasoning is known, is the first formal system of logic ever devised, and it
					remained the basic model for logic up until the 19th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But the syllogism was more than simply a by-product of Aristotle’s systematic
					classification of the natural world. By using analytical reasoning in the form
					of logic, Aristotle realized that the power of reason was something that did not
					rely on the senses, and that it must therefore be an innate characteristic&mdash;part
					of what it is to be human. Although we have no innate ideas, we do possess this
					innate faculty, which is necessary for us to learn from experience. And as he
					applied this fact to his hierarchical system, he saw that the innate power of
					reason is what distinguishes us from all other living creatures, and placed us
					at the top of the hierarchy.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways,

					overturns Plato’s theory of Forms, should have ensured that his philosophy had a
					far greater impact than it did during his lifetime. That is not to say that his
					work was without fault&mdash;his geography and astronomy were flawed; his ethics
					supported the use of slaves and considered women to be inferior human beings;
					and his logic was incomplete by modern standards. However, what he got right
					amounted to a revolution both in philosophy and in science.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Aristotle lived at the end of an era. Alexander the Great, whom he taught,
					died shortly before him, and so began the Hellenistic period of Greek history
					which saw a decline in Athens’ influence. The Roman Empire was becoming the
					dominant power in the Mediterranean, and the philosophy it adopted from Greece
					was that of the Stoics. The rival schools of Plato and Aristotle&mdash;Plato’s Academy
					and the Lyceum Aristotle founded in Athens&mdash;continued to operate, but they had
					lost their former eminence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this neglect, many of Aristotle’s writings were lost. It is
					believed that he wrote several hundred treatises and dialogues explaining his
					theories, but all that remain are fragments of his work, mainly in the form of
					lectures and teacher’s notes. Luckily for posterity, these were preserved by his
					followers, and there is enough contained in them to give a picture of the full
					range of his work.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Every action must be due to one or other of seven causes: chance, nature,

					translated into Arabic and spread throughout the Islamic world, becoming
					essential reading for Middle Eastern scholars such as Avicenna and Averroes. In
					Western Europe, however, Boethius’s Latin translation of Aristotle’s treatise on
					logic (made in the 6th century CE) remained the only work of Aristotle’s
					available until the 9th century CE, when all of Aristotle’s works began to be
					translated from Arabic into Latin. It was also at this time that his ideas were
					collected into the the books we know today&mdash;such as <i class="calibre12">Physics, The Nicomachean Ethics,</i> and the <i class="calibre12">Organon</i>. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas braved a ban on
					Aristotle’s work and integrated it into Christian philosophy, in the same way
					that St. Augustine had adopted Plato, and Plato and Aristotle came to lock horns
					again.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle’s notes on logic (laid out in the <i class="calibre12">Organon</i>) remained the standard text on logic until the emergence
					of mathematical logic in the 19th century. Likewise, his classification of
					living things dominated Western thinking throughout the Middle Ages, becoming
					the Christian <i class="calibre12">scala naturae</i> (the “ladder of
					nature”), or the Great Chain of Being. This depicted the whole of creation
					dominated by man, who stood second only to God. And during the Renaissance,
					Aristotle’s empirical method of enquiry held sway.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 17th century, the debate between empiricists and rationalists reached
					its zenith after René Descartes published his <i class="calibre12">Discourse
						on the Method</i>. Descartes, and Leibniz and Kant after him, chose
					the rationalist route; in response, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume lined up as the
					empiricist opposition. Again, the differences between the philosophers were as
					much about temperament as they were about substance&mdash;the Continental versus the
					English, the poetic versus the academic, the Platonic versus the Aristotelian.
					Although the debate died down in the 19th century, there has been a revival of
					interest in Aristotle in recent times, and a reappraisal of his significance.
					His ethics in particular have been of great appeal to modern philosophers, who
					have seen in his functional definition of “good” a key to understanding the way
					we use ethical language.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"There is nothing in the mind except was first in the senses."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">John Locke</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-285"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000295.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The influence of Aristotle</span> on the

				already reached a pinnacle in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle. The main focus of
				philosophical thinking was shifting from metaphysics toward ethics&mdash;and also from
				political to personal ethics. Epicurus, however, found the seeds of a new school of
				thought in the quests of earlier philosophers, such as Socrates’ examination of the
				truth of basic human concepts and values.</p><p class="calibre13">Central to the philosophy that Epicurus developed is the view that peace of mind,
				or tranquillity, is the goal of life. He argues that pleasure and pain are the roots
				of good and evil, and qualities such as virtue and justice derive from these roots,
				as “it is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely, honorably, and
				justly, and it is impossible to live wisely, honorably, and justly without living
				pleasantly.” Epicurianism is often mistakenly interpreted as simply being about the
				pursuit of sensual pleasures. For Epicurus, the greatest pleasure is only attainable
				through knowledge and friendship, and a temperate life, with freedom from fear and
				pain.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-290"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000194.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Fear of death</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One of the obstacles to enjoying the peace of a tranquil mind, Epicurus
					reasons, is the fear of death, and this fear is increased by the religious
					belief that if you incur the wrath of the gods, you will be severely punished in
					the afterlife. But rather than countering this fear by proposing an alternative
					state of immortality, Epicurus tries to explain the nature of death itself. He
					starts by proposing that when we die, we are unaware of our death, since our
					consciousness (our soul) ceases to exist at the point of death. To explain this,
					Epicurus takes the view that the entire universe consists of either atoms or
					empty space, as argued by the atomist philosophers Democritus and Leucippus.
					Epicurus then reasons that the soul could not be empty space, because it
					operates dynamically with the body, so it must be made up of atoms. He describes
					these atoms of the soul as being distributed around the body, but as being so
					fragile that they dissolve when we die, and so we are no longer capable of
					sensing anything. If you are unable to feel anything, mentally or physically,
					when you die, it is foolish to let the fear of death cause you pain while you
					are still alive.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Epicurus attracted a small but devoted following in his lifetime, but he was
					perceived as being dismissive of religion, which made him unpopular. His
					thinking was largely ignored by mainstream philosophy for centuries, but it
					resurfaced in the 18th century, in the ideas of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart
					Mill. In revolutionary politics, the tenets of Epicureanism are echoed in the
					words of the United States’ Declaration of Independence: “life, liberty, and the
					pursuit of happiness.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-292"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Terrifying images</span> of the merciless god

				it is necessary to free oneself from the external restrictions imposed by society,
				and from the internal discontentment that is caused by desire, emotion, and fear.
				This can be achieved, he states, by being content to live a simple life, governed by
				reason and natural impulses, rejecting conventions without shame, and renouncing the
				desire for property and comfort.</p><p class="calibre13">Diogenes was the first of a group of thinkers who became known as the Cynics, a

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-145"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Philosophy did not play a large part in Roman culture, other than
				Stoicism, which was admired by the Romans for its emphasis on virtuous conduct and
				doing one’s duty. The broader philosophical tradition that had been established by
				the Classical Greeks was therefore effectively marginalized under the Roman Empire.
				Philosophy continued to be taught in Athens, but its influence dwindled, and no
				significant philosophers emerged until Plotinus in the 3rd century CE, who founded
				an important Neo-Platonist school.</p><p class="calibre13">During the first millennium of the Common Era, Roman influence also waned, both
				politically and culturally. Christianity became assimilated into the Roman culture,
				and after the fall of the empire in the 5th century, the Church became the dominant
				authority in Western Europe, remaining so for almost 1,000 years. The Greek idea of
				philosophy as rational examination independent of religious doctrine sat
				uncomfortably with the rise of Christianity. Questions about the nature of the
				universe and what constitutes a virtuous life were held to be answered in the
				scriptures; they were not considered subjects for philosophical discussion.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Christian philosophers such as St. Augustine of Hippo sought to integrate
				Greek philosophy into the Christian religion. This process was the main task of
				scholasticism, a philosophical approach that stemmed from the monastic schools and
				was renowned for its rigorous dialectical reasoning. The work of scholastic
				philosophers such as Augustine was not so much an exploration of questions such as
				“Is there a God?” or “Does man have an immortal soul?” as a search for a rational
				justification for the belief in God and an immortal soul.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-301"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000060.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-302" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Dark Ages</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As the Roman Empire shrank and eventually fell, Europe sank into the “Dark
					Ages” and most of the culture it had inherited from Greece and Rome disappeared.
					The Church held the monopoly on learning, and the only true philosophy that
					survived was a form of Platonism deemed compatible with Christianity, and
					Boethius’s translation of Aristotle’s <i class="calibre12">Logic</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, however, culture thrived. China and Japan in particular enjoyed a
					“Golden Age” of poetry and art, while traditional eastern philosophies coexisted
					happily with their religions. In the lands that had been part of Alexander the
					Great’s empire, the Greek legacy commanded more respect than in Europe. Arabic
					and Persian scholars preserved and translated the works of the Classical Greek
					philosophers, incorporating their ideas into Islamic culture from the 6th
					century onward.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As Islam spread eastward into Asia and across north Africa and into Spain, its
					influence began to be felt in Europe. By the 12th century, news of ideas and
					inventions from the Islamic world were reaching as far north as Britain, and
					European scholars started to rediscover Greek mathematics and philosophy through
					Islamic sources. The works of Aristotle in particular came as something of a
					revelation, and they sparked a resurgence of philosophical thinking within the
					medieval Christian Church. But whereas Plato’s philosophy had been comparatively
					easy to assimilate into Christian thought, because it provided rational
					justification for belief in God and the immortal human soul, Aristotle was
					treated with suspicion by the Church authorities. Nevertheless, Christian
					philosophers including Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of
					Ockham enthusiastically embraced the new Aristotelianism and eventually
					convinced the Church of its compatibility with Christian faith.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A new rationality</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Along with the philosophy that revitalized the Church, the Islamic world also
					introduced a wealth of technological and scientific knowledge to medieval
					Europe. Aristotle’s scientific methods had been refined to sophisticated levels
					in Persia, and advances in chemistry, physics, medicine, and particularly
					astronomy undermined the authority of the Church when they arrived in
					Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-introduction of Greek thinking and the new ideas that led to Europe’s
					Renaissance in the late 15th century sparked a change of mood as people began to
					look more toward reason rather than faith to provide them with answers. There
					was dissent even within the Church, as humanists such as Erasmus provoked the
					Reformation. Philosophers themselves turned their attention away from questions
					of God and the immortal soul toward the problems posed by science and the
					natural world.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				entirely good and all-powerful, why is there evil in the world? For Christians such
				as Augustine, as well as for adherents of Judaism and Islam, this was, and remains,
				a central question. This is because it makes an obvious fact about the world&mdash;that it
				contains evil&mdash;into an argument against the existence of God.</p><p class="calibre13">Augustine is able to answer one aspect of the problem quite easily. He believes
				that although God created everything that exists, he did not create evil, because
				evil is not a thing, but a lack or deficiency of something. For example, the evil
				suffered by a blind man is that he is without sight; the evil in a thief is that he
				lacks honesty. Augustine borrowed this way of thinking from Plato and his
				followers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-306"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000398.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-307" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An essential freedom</h2></div><p class="calibre14">But Augustine still needs to explain why God should have created the world in
					such a way as to allow there to be these natural and moral evils, or
					deficiencies. His answer revolves around the idea that humans are rational
					beings. He argues that in order for God to create rational creatures, such as
					human beings, he had to give them freedom of will. Having freedom of will means
					being able to choose, including choosing between good and evil. For this reason
					God had to leave open the possibility that the first man, Adam, would choose
					evil rather than good. According to the Bible this is exactly what happened, as
					Adam broke God’s command not to eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Augustine’s argument holds even without referring to the Bible.
					Rationality is the ability to evaluate choices through the process of reasoning.
					The process is only possible where there is freedom of choice, including the
					freedom to choose to do wrong.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine also suggests a third solution to the problem, asking us to see the
					world as a thing of beauty. He says that although there is evil in the universe,

				how can we be said to have free will?</p><p class="calibre13">The best way to understand the dilemma is to imagine a situation in everyday life.
				For instance, this afternoon I might go to the cinema, or I might spend time
				writing. As it turns out, I go to the cinema. That being the case, it is true now
				(before the event) that I will go the cinema this afternoon. But if it is true now,
				then it seems that I do not really have the choice of spending the afternoon
				writing. Aristotle was the first to define this problem, but his answer to it is not
				very clear; he seems to have thought that a sentence such as “I shall go to the
				cinema this afternoon” is neither true nor false, or at least not in the same way as
				“I went to the cinema yesterday.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-314"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000094.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-315" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A God beyond time</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Boethius faced a harder version of the same problem. He believed that God
					knows everything; not only the past and the present, but also the future. So if
					I am going to go to the cinema this afternoon, God knows it now. It seems,
					therefore, that I am not really free to choose to spend the afternoon writing,
					since that would conflict with what God already knows.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boethius solves the problem by arguing that the same thing can be known in
					different ways, depending on the nature of the knower. My dog, for instance,
					knows the sun only as something with qualities he can sense&mdash;by sight and touch.
					A person, however, can also reason about the category of thing the sun is, and
					may know which elements it is made of, its distance from Earth, and so
					on.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boethius considers time in a similar kind of way. As we live in the flow of
					time, we can only know events as past (if they have occurred), present (if they
					are happening now), or future (if they will come to pass). We cannot know the
					outcome of uncertain future events. God, by contrast, is not in the flow of
					time. He lives in an eternal present, and knows what to us are past, present,
					and future in the same way that we know the present. And just as my knowledge
					that you are sitting now does not interfere with your freedom to stop, so too
					God’s knowledge of our future actions, as if they were present, does not stop
					them from being free.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some thinkers today argue that since I have not yet decided whether I shall go
					to the cinema this afternoon, there is simply nothing to be known about it, so
					even a God who is all-knowing does not, and cannot, know if I shall go or

				in the Arabic tradition, and one of the world’s greatest thinkers. Like his
				predecessors, al-Kindî and al-Fârâbî, and his successor, Averroes, Avicenna
				self-consciously marked himself out as a philosopher rather than an Islamic
				theologian, choosing to follow Greek wisdom and the path of reasoning and proof. In
				particular, he saw himself as a follower of Aristotle, and his main writings are
				encyclopedias of Aristotelian philosophy.</p><p class="calibre13">However, these works explain Aristotle’s philosophy as re-thought and synthesized
				by Avicenna. On some doctrines, such as the idea that the universe has always
				existed, Avicenna kept to the Aristotelian view despite the fact that it clashed
				with Islamic orthodoxy, but in other areas he felt free to depart radically from
				Aristotle. One striking example is his explanation of the relationship between mind
				(self or soul) and body.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-321"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000410.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Mind and body are distinct</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Aristotle claims that the body and mind of humans (and other animals) are not
					two different things (or “substances”), but one unit, and that the mind is the
					“form” of the human body. As such, it is responsible for all the activities a
					human being can perform, including thinking. For this reason Aristotle does not
					seem to think it possible for anything to survive the death of the body.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, Avicenna is one of the most famous “dualists” in the history of
					philosophy&mdash;he thinks that the body and the mind are two distinct substances. His
					great predecessor in this view was Plato, who thought of the mind as a distinct
					thing that was imprisoned in the body. Plato believed that at the point of
					death, the mind would be released from its prison, to be later reincarnated in
					another body.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeking to prove the divided nature of mind and body, Avicenna devised a
					thought-experiment known as the “Flying Man.” This appears as a treatise,
						<i class="calibre12">On the Soul</i>, within his <i class="calibre12">Book of Healing</i>, and it aims to strip away any
					knowledge that can possibly be disproved, and leave us only with absolute
					truths. It remarkably anticipates the much later work of Descartes, the famous
					dualist of the 17th century, who also decided to believe nothing at all except
					that which he himself could know for certain. Both Avicenna and Descartes want
					to demonstrate that the mind or self exists because it knows it exists; and that
					it is distinct from the human body.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-323" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Flying Man</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the Flying Man experiment, Avicenna wants to examine what we can know if we
					are effectively robbed of our senses, and cannot depend on them for information.
					He asks us each to imagine this: suppose I have just come into existence, but I
					have all my normal intelligence. Suppose, too, that I am blindfolded and that I
					am floating in the air, and my limbs are separated from each other, so I can
					touch nothing. Suppose I am entirely without any sensations. None the less, I
					will be sure that I myself exist. But what is this self, which is me? It cannot
					be any of the parts of my body, because I do not know that I have any. The self
					that I affirm as existing does not have length or breadth or depth. It has no
					extension, or physicality. And, if I were able to imagine, for instance, a hand,
					I would not think that it belonged to this self which I know exists.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from this that the human self&mdash;what I am&mdash;is distinct from my body,
					or anything physical. The Flying Man experiment, says Avicenna, is a way of
					alerting and reminding oneself of the existence of the mind as something other
					than, and distinct from, the body.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Avicenna also has other ways to show that the mind cannot be something
					material. Most are based on the fact that the type of intellectual knowledge the
					mind can grasp cannot not be contained by anything material. It is easy to see
					how the parts of physical, shaped things fit with the parts of a physical,
					shaped sense organ: the image of the wall that I see is stretched over the lens
					of my eye, each of its parts corresponding to a part of the lens. But the mind
					is not a sense organ; what it grasps are definitions, such as “Man is a
					rational, mortal animal.” The parts of this phrase need to be grasped at once,
					together. The mind therefore cannot be in any way like or part of the
					body.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-324"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000174.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Avicenna’s medical knowledge</span> was so

					the body dies, and that it is immortal. This did not help to make his thinking
					more palatable to orthodox Muslims, who believe that the whole person, body and
					mind, is resurrected and enjoys the afterlife. Consequently, Avicenna was
					attacked in the 12th century by the great Islamic theologian al-Ghazâlî, who
					called him a heretic for abandoning the central Islamic tenet of the
					resurrection of the dead. But in the same century Avicenna’s work was also
					translated into Latin, and his dualism became popular among Christian
					philosophers and theologians. They liked the way his interpretations of
					Aristotle’s texts made them easily compatible with the idea of an immortal
					soul.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"But what is it that I am? A thinking thing."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">René Descartes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The indubitable self</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Some 200 years later, in the 1250s, Thomas Aquinas championed a more faithful
					interpretation of Aristotle, in which the mind and body are much more closely
					tied together, and his views were widely accepted by the theologians of the 16th
					and 17th centuries. But in 1640 Descartes returned to a dualism that was nearer
					to Plato’s than Aristotle’s, and his argument for it was very like
					Avicenna’s.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Descartes imagines that there is a demon who is trying to deceive him about
					everything on which he might possibly be deceived. The one thing that he cannot
					be deceived about, he realizes, is that he exists. This self is exactly the self
					which Avicenna’s Flying Man is sure of, when he has no other knowledge. Like
					Avicenna, Descartes can then conclude that the “I”, or self, is completely
					distinct from the body, and that it must be immortal.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The ghost in the machine</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One very strong objection to the dualism of Avicenna or Descartes is the
					argument used by Aquinas. He says that the self which thinks is the same as the
					self which feels sensations in the body. For instance, I do not just observe
					that there is a pain in my leg, in the way that a sailor might notice a hole in
					his ship. The pain belongs to me as much as my thoughts about philosophy, or
					what I might have for lunch.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Most contemporary philosophers reject mind-body dualism, largely because of
					the increasing scientific knowledge of the brain. Avicenna and Descartes were
					both very interested in physiology and they produced scientific accounts of
					activities such as movement and sensation. But the process of rational thinking
					was inexplicable with the scientific tools of their times. We are now able to
					explain quite precisely how thinking goes on in different areas of the
					brain&mdash;though whether this means that we can explain thinking without reference
					to a self is not so clear. An influential 20th-century British philosopher,
					Gilbert Ryle, caricatured the dualists’ self as “a ghost in the machine”, and
					tried to show that we can explain how human beings perceive and function within
					the world without resorting to this “ghost” of a self.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today philosophers are divided between a small number of dualists, a larger
					number of thinkers who say that the mind is simply a brain, and the majority,
					who agree that thinking is the result of the physical activity of the brain, but
					still insist there is a distinction between the physical states of the brain
					(the gray matter, the neurons, and so on), and the thinking which derives from
					them.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many philosophers, especially continental European thinkers, still accept the
					results of Avicenna’s thought experiment in one central way. It shows, they say,
					that we each have a self with a first-person view of the world (the “I”) that
					cannot be accommodated by the objective view of scientific theories.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-328"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000148.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Philip Pullman’s tale, </span><i class="calibre20">Northern Lights,</i> picks up on the

				11th-century Italian philosopher who worked on the basis of Aristotelian logic,
				Platonic thinking, and his own genius&mdash;is probably the most famous of all.</p><p class="calibre13">Anselm imagines himself arguing with a <a href="#calibre_link-166" class="calibre3">Fool</a>, who denies that God exists. The argument rests on
				an acceptance of two things: first, that God is “that than which nothing greater can
				be thought”, and second, that existence is superior to non-existence. By the end of
				the argument the Fool is forced to either take up a self-contradictory position or
				admit that God exists.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument has been accepted by many great philosophers, such as René Descartes
				and Baruch Spinoza. But there have been many others who took up the Fool’s side. One
				contemporary of Anselm’s, Gaunilo of Marmoutiers, said that we could use the same
				argument to prove that there exists somewhere a marvellous island, greater than any
				island that can be thought. In the 18th century Immanuel Kant objected that the
				argument treats existence as if it were an attribute of things&mdash;as if I might
				describe my jacket like this: “it’s green, made of tweed, and it exists.” Existing
				is not like being green: if it did not exist, there would be no jacket to be green
				or tweed.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant holds that Anselm is also wrong to say that what exists in reality as well as

				society. He thinks that only the educated elite are capable of thinking
				philosophically, and everyone else should be obliged to accept the teaching of the
				Qur’an literally. Averroes does not think that the Qur’an provides a completely
				accurate account of the universe if read in this literal way, but says that it is a
				poetic approximation of the truth, and this is the most that the uneducated can
				grasp.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Averroes believes that educated people have a religious obligation to use
				philosophical reasoning. Whenever reasoning shows the literal meaning of the Qur’an

					Aristotle that it has always existed, and says that there is nothing in the
					Qur’an to contradict this view. However, the resurrection of the dead, a basic
					tenet of Islam, is harder to include within an Aristotelian universe. Averroes
					accepts that we must believe in personal immortality, and that anyone who denies
					this is a heretic who should be executed. But he takes a different position from
					his predecessors by saying that Aristotle’s treatise <i class="calibre12">On
						the Soul</i> does not state that individual humans have immortal
					souls. According to Averroes’ interpretation, Aristotle claims that humanity is
					immortal only through a shared intellect. Averroes seems to be saying that there

					included Jewish scholars such as Moses of Narbonne, and Latin scholars such as
					Boethius of Dacia and Siger of Brabant. The Latin Averroists acccepted Aristotle
					as interpreted by Averroes as the truth according to reason&mdash;despite also
					affirming an apparently conflicting set of Christian “truths.” They have been

				thought (in Arabic). In both areas, one of his central concerns was to guard against
				anthropomorphizing God, which is the tendency to think about God in the same way as
				a human being. For Maimonides, the worst mistake of all is to take the Torah (the
				first part of the Hebrew Bible) as literal truth, and to think that God is a bodily
				thing. Anyone who thinks this, he says, should be excluded from the Jewish
				community. But in the <i class="calibre12">Guide of the Perplexed</i>,
				Maimonides pushes this idea to its farthest extent, developing a strand of thought
				known as “negative theology.” This already existed in Christian theology, and it
				focuses on describing God only in terms of what God is not.</p><p class="calibre13">God, Maimonides says, has no attributes. We cannot rightly say that God is “good”
				or “powerful.” This is because an attribute is either accidental (capable of change)
				or essential. One of my accidental attributes, for example, is that I am sitting;
				others are that I have gray hair and a long nose. But I would still be what I
				essentially am even if I were standing, red-haired, and had a snub-nose. Being
				human&mdash;that is, being a rational, mortal animal&mdash;is my essential attribute: it defines
				me. God, it is generally agreed, has no accidental attributes, because God is
				unchanging. In addition, says Maimonides, God cannot have any essential attributes
				either, because they would be defining, and God cannot be defined. So God has no
				attributes at all.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-345"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000020.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Speaking about God</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Maimondes claims that we can say things about God, but they must be understood
					as telling us about God’s actions, rather than God’s being. Most discussions in
					the Torah should be understood in this way. So when we are told that “God is a
					creator”, we must understand this as stating what God does, rather than the sort
					of thing God is. If we were to consider the sentence “John is a writer”, we
					might normally take it to mean that being a writer is John’s profession. But
					Maimonides asks us to consider only what has been done: in this instance John
					has written words. The writing has been brought about by John but it does not
					tell us anything about him.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maimonides also accepts that statements which seem to attribute qualities to
					God can be understood if they are taken as double negatives. “God is powerful”:
					should be taken to mean that God is not powerless. Imagine a game in which I
					think of a thing and tell you what it is not (it is not large, it is not red…)
					until you guess what it is. The difference in the case of God is that we have

				been part of Islam since its foundation in the 7th century, but had not always been
				accepted by mainstream Islamic scholars. Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, better known
				simply as Rumi, was brought up in orthodox Islam, and first came into contact with
				Sufism when his family moved from the eastern edges of Persia to Anatolia in the
				mid-13th century. The Sufi concept of uniting with God through love caught his
				imagination, and from this he developed a version of Sufism that sought to explain
				the relationship of man with the divine.</p><p class="calibre13">Rumi became a teacher in a Sufi order, and as such he believed he was a medium
				between God and man. In contrast to general Islamic practice, he placed much
				emphasis on <i class="calibre12">dhikr</i>&mdash;ritual prayer or litany&mdash;rather
				than rational analysis of the Qur’an for divine guidance, and became known for his
				ecstatic revelations. He believed it was his task to communicate the visions he
				experienced, and so he wrote them down in the form of poetry. Central to his
				visionary philosophy is the idea that the universe and everything in it is an
				endless flow of life, in which God is an eternal presence. Man, as part of the
				universe, is also a part of this continuum, and Rumi seeks to explain our place
				within it.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, he believes, is a link between the past and future in a continual process of
				life, death, and rebirth&mdash;not as a cycle, but in a progression from one form to
				another stretching into eternity. Death and decay are inevitable and part of this
				endless flow of life, but as something ceases to exist in one form, it is reborn in
				another. Because of this, we should have no fear of death, and nor should we grieve
				a loss. In order to ensure our growth from one form to another, however, we should
				strive for spiritual growth and an understanding of the divine&ndash;human relationship.
				Rumi believes that this understanding comes from emotion rather than from
				reason&mdash;emotion enhanced by music, song, and dance.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-352"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000334.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-353"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000096.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Mawlawi Order</span>, or Whirling Dervishes,

					20th century, however, his ideas became very popular in the West, mainly because
					his message of love chimed with the New Age values of the 1960s. Perhaps his

					changing for ever.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Arabic philosophers, Avicenna and Averroes, were willing to accept
					Aristotle’s view, even though it put them at odds with Islamic orthodoxy.
					Medieval Jewish and Christian thinkers, however, struggled to do so. They held
					that, according to the Bible, the universe has a beginning, so Aristotle must be
					wrong: the universe has not always existed. But was this view something that had
					to be accepted on faith, or could it be refuted by reasoning?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;John Philoponus, a Greek Christian writer of the 6th century, believed that he
					had found an argument to show that Aristotle must be wrong, and that the
					universe had not always existed. His reasoning was copied and developed by a
					number of thinkers in the 13th century, who needed to find a flaw in Aristotle’s
					reasoning in order to protect the teachings of the Church. Their line of
					argument was especially clever, because it took Aristotle’s own ideas about
					infinity as a point of departure, but turned them against his view of the
					universe as eternal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-360"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000229.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Aquinas is flanked</span> by Aristotle and

For instance, the
					sequence of numbers is infinite, because for each number, there is another
					higher number that follows. Similarly, the universe has existed for an infinite
					time, because for each day, there is a preceding day. In Aristotle’s opinion,
					however, this is a “potential” infinity, as these days do not coexist at the
					same time; an “actual” infinity&mdash;in which an infinite number of things all exist
					at the same time&mdash;is impossible.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Philoponus and his 13th-century followers, however, think that this argument
					presents problems that Aristotle had not noticed. They point to the fact that he
					believes that all the types of living beings in the universe have always
					existed. If this were true, they say, it would mean that there were already an
					infinite number of human beings by the time Socrates was born&mdash;because if they
					have always existed, they existed then. But since Socrates’ time, many more
					humans have been born, and so the number of humans born up until now must be
					greater than infinity. But no number can be greater than infinity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, these writers add, Christian thinkers believe that human souls
					are immortal. If this is so, and an infinite number of humans has already
					existed, there must be an infinite number of human souls in existence now. So
					there is an actual infinity of souls, not a potential infinity; and Aristotle
					has said actual infinity is impossible.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two arguments, using Aristotle’s own principles as a starting
					point, Philoponus and his followers were confident they had demonstrated that
					the universe cannot always have existed. Aristotle was therefore wrong; the
					universe is not eternal, and this fits perfectly with the Christian doctrine
					that God created the world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquinas has little time for this line of reasoning. He points out that the
					universe could have existed for ever but that species such as humans and other
					animals might have had a beginning, and so the difficulties raised by Philoponus
					and his followers can be avoided. Despite his defence of Aristotle’s reasoning,
					Aquinas does not accept Aristotle’s assertion that the universe is eternal,
					because the Christian faith says otherwise; but he doesn’t think that
					Aristotle’s position is illogical. Like Philoponus and his followers, Aquinas
					wants to show that the universe had a beginning&mdash;but he also wants to show that
					there is no flaw in Aristotle’s reasoning. He claims that his Christian
					contemporaries have confused two different points: the first is that God created
					the universe, and the second is that the universe had a beginning. Aquinas set
					out to prove that in fact Aristotle’s position&mdash;that the universe has always
						existed&mdash;<i class="calibre12">could</i> be true, even if it is also
					true that God created the universe.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-362"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000147.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"There never was a time when there was not motion."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aristotle</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-363" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Creating the eternal</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Aquinas steps away from Philoponus and his followers by insisting that

					created the universe with a beginning, but he could just as easily have created
					an eternal one. If something is created by God, then it owes its whole existence
					to God, but that does not mean that there must have been a time when it did not
					exist at all. It is therefore quite possible to believe in an eternal universe
					that had been created by God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquinas gives an example of how this might work. Suppose there was a foot
					making a footprint in the sand and it had been there for ever. Although there
					would never have been a moment before the footprint was made, we would still
					recognize the foot as the cause of the footprint: if it were not for the foot,

					Aristotelian philosophy, as if he took the parts he wanted from each and made
					them into a smooth mixture. In fact, for Aquinas&mdash;as for most Christians&mdash;the
					teachings of the Church must all be accepted, without exception or compromise.
					Aquinas was unusual, however, because he thought that, properly understood,
					Aristotle did not contradict Christian teaching. The question of whether the
					universe always existed is the exception that proves the rule. In this
					particular case Aquinas thinks that Aristotle was wrong, but he was not wrong in
					principle, or in his reasoning. The universe really might have existed for ever,
					as far as the ancient philosophers knew. It was just that Aristotle, not having
					access to Christian revelation, had no way of knowing that it had not.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquinas believes that there are a number of other doctrines central to
					Christianity that the ancient philosophers did not know and could not have
					known&mdash;such as the belief that God is a Trinity made up of three persons, and
					that one person of the Trinity, the Son, became a human. But in Aquinas’s
					opinion, whenever humans reason correctly, they cannot come to any conclusion
					which contradicts Christian doctrine. This is because both human reason and
					Christian teaching come from the same source&mdash;God&mdash;and so they can never
					contradict each other.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquinas taught in convents and universities in France and Italy, and the idea
					that human reason could never conflict with Christian doctrine often placed him
					in fierce conflict with some of his academic contemporaries, especially those
					who specialized in the sciences, which at the time were derived from the work of
					Aristotle. Aquinas accused his fellow scholars of accepting certain positions on
					faith&mdash;for example, the position that we each have an immortal soul&ndash; but of
					saying at the same time that according to reason, these positions could be shown
					to be wrong.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-366"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000159.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Aristotle believed</span> that the universe

					particularly clear in two central areas of his thought: his account of how we
					gain knowledge and his treatment of the relation between mind and body.
					According to Aquinas, human beings acquire knowledge through using their senses:
					sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. These sense-impressions, however, only
					tell us what things are like superficially. For example, from where John sits,
					he has a visual impression of a tree-shaped object, which is green and brown. I,
					on the other hand, am standing next to the tree, and can feel the roughness of
					its bark and smell the scent of the forest. If John and I were dogs, our
					knowledge of the tree would be limited to these sense-impressions. But as human
					beings we are able to go beyond them and grasp what a tree is in a rational way,
					defining it and distinguishing it from other types of plants and of living
					things. Aquinas calls this “intellectual knowledge”, because we gain it by using
					the innate power of our intellect to seize, on the basis of sense-impressions,
					the reality that lies behind them. Animals other than humans lack this inborn
					capacity, which is why their knowledge cannot stretch beyond the senses. All of
					our scientific understanding of the world is based on this intellectual
					knowledge. Aquinas’s theory of knowledge owes much to Aristotle, although he
					clarifies and elaborates upon the latter’s thinking. For Aquinas, as a Christian
					thinker, human beings are only one type of the various sorts of beings that are
					capable of knowing things intellectually: souls separated from their bodies in
					the afterlife, angels, and God himself can also do this. These other knowing
					beings do not have to acquire knowledge through the senses. They can directly
					grasp the definitions of things. This aspect of Aquinas’s theory has no parallel
					in Aristotle, but it is a coherent development of Aristotle’s principles. Once
					again Aquinas is able to hold Christian beliefs without contradicting Aristotle,
					but going beyond him.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"We should see whether there is a contradiction between something being
						created by God, and its existing forever."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Thomas Aquinas</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The human soul</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to Aristotle, the intellect is the life-principle or “soul” of a
					human being. All living things have a soul, he believes, which explains their
					capacity for different levels of what he calls “life-activity”, such as growing
					and reproducing, for plants; moving, sensing, seeking, and avoiding, for
					animals; and thinking for humans.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle believes that “form” is what makes matter into the thing that it is.
					Within the human body, this form is the soul, which makes the body into the
					living thing that it is by giving it a particular set of life-activities. As
					such, the soul is tied to the body, and so Aristotle thinks that, even in the
					case of humans, the life-soul survives only so long as it animates a body, and
					at death it perishes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquinas follows Aristotle’s teaching about living things and their souls, and
					he insists that a human being has just one form: his or her intellect. Although
					other 13th- and 14th-century thinkers also adopted the main lines of Aristotle’s
					view, they cut the connection Aristotle had made between the intellect and the
					body, so they could accommodate the Christian teaching that the human soul
					survives death. Aquinas, however, refuses to distort Aristotle’s position. This
					made it far more difficult for him to argue&mdash;as he did&mdash;for the immortality of the
					human soul, in yet another example of his resolve to be a good Aristotelian, and
					philosopher, while remaining a faithful Christian.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">After Aquinas</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Since the Middle Ages, Aquinas has come to be regarded as the official
					orthodox philosopher of the Catholic Church. In his own time, when translations
					of Greek philosophy were being made from Arabic, complete with Arabic
					commentaries, he was one of the thinkers keenest to follow Aristotle’s train of
					philosophical reasoning, even when it did not fit neatly with Christian
					doctrine. He always remained faithful to the Church’s teachings, but this did
					not prevent his thought from almost being condemned as heretical shortly after
					his death. The great thinkers and teachers of the following century, such as the
					secular philosopher Henry of Ghent, and the Franciscans John Duns Scotus and
					William of Ockham, were all far more willing to say that purely philosophical
					reasoning, as best represented by Aristotle’s arguments, is often
					mistaken.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Scotus thought that Aquinas’s Aristotelian view of the soul was inadequate,
					and Ockham rejected Aristotle’s account of knowledge almost entirely. Henry of
					Ghent explicitly criticized Aquinas’s view that God could have created a
					universe that always exists. If it always existed, he argued, there would be no
					possibility of its not existing, and so God would not have been free to create
					or not create it. Aquinas’s supreme confidence in the power of reason meant that
					he had more in common with the greatest philosopher of the previous century, the
					French philosopher and theologian Pierre Abélard, than he did with his
					contemporaries and successors.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-370"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000133.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The laws of cause and effect</span> lead us to

							uncaused.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-371" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Coherent belief</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Both Aquinas’s general view on the relation between philosophy and Christian
					doctrine, and his particular treatment of the eternity of the universe, remain
					relevant in the 21st century. Today few philosophers believe that religious
					positions, such as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, can be
					proved by philosophical reasoning. But what some claim for philosophy is that it
					can demonstrate that although religious believers hold certain doctrines as a
					matter of faith, their overall views are no less rational or coherent than those
					of agnostics or atheists. This view is an extension and development of Aquinas’s
					constant endeavor to develop a philosophically coherent system of thought, while
					holding on to his Christian beliefs. Reading Aquinas’s works is a lesson in
					tolerance, for Christians and non-Christians alike.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-372"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000105.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Cosmic background radiation</span> provides

					always existed, and most of us do not turn to the Bible, as Aquinas and other
					medieval philosophers did. Instead we look to physics, in particular to the
					theory of the “Big Bang” proposed by modern scientists, including the British
					physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking. This theory states that the universe
					expanded from a state of extremely high temperature and density at a particular
					point in time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Though most of us now turn to science for an explanation of how the universe
					began, the arguments of Aquinas show that philosophy is still relevant to how we
					think about the subject. He demonstrates how philosophy can provide the tools
					for intelligent enquiry, allowing us to investigate not what happens to be the
					case, but what is possible and what is impossible, and what are intelligible
					questions to ask. Is it or is it not coherent to believe that the universe had a
					beginning? This is still a question for philosophers, and no amount of
					theoretical physics will be able to answer it.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"One may say that time had a beginning at the Big Bang, in the sense that

					he studied in Paris and then in Cologne under the German Aristotelian
					theologian, Albert the Great. Returning to Paris, he became Master (professor)
					of theology, before leaving to travel around Italy teaching for 10 years.
					Unusually, Aquinas was then offered a second period of tenure as Master at
					Paris. In 1273 he experienced something that has been considered both some sort
					of vision and a possible stroke; after it, he said that all he had done was
					“mere straw”, and he never wrote again. He died at the age of 49, and was

				Von Kues, writing around 1440, goes further, stating that God is what comes before
				everything, even before the possibility of something existing. Yet reason tells us
				the possibility of any phenomenon existing must come before its actual existence. It
				is impossible for something to come into being before the possibility of it arises.

				Europe&mdash;began in 14th-century Florence. It was to spread across Europe, lasting until
				the 17th century, and it is now viewed as the bridge between the medieval and modern
				periods. Marked by a renewed interest in the whole of Greek and Latin Classical
				culture&mdash;not just the philosophical and mathematical texts assimilated by medieval
				Scholasticism&mdash;it was a movement that viewed humans, not God, at its center. This new
				humanism was reflected first in the art and then the political and social structure
				of Italian society; republics such as Florence and Venice soon abandoned medieval
				feudalism in favor of plutocracies where commerce flourished alongside the new
				scientific discoveries.</p><p class="calibre13">By the end of the 15th century, Renaissance ideas had spread across Europe and
				virtually eclipsed the Church’s monopoly of learning. Although Christian

					First Nicolaus Copernicus, then Johannes Kepler, and finally Galileo Galilei
					showed that the Ptolemaic model of the universe with Earth at its center was
					mistaken, and their demonstrations overturned centuries of Christian teaching.
					The Church fought back, ultimately imprisoning Galileo for heresy, but advances
					in all the sciences soon followed those in astronomy, providing alternative
					explanations for the workings of the universe, and a basis for a new kind of
					philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory of rational, scientific discovery over Christian dogma epitomized
					the thinking of the 17th century. British philosophers, notably Francis Bacon
					and Thomas Hobbes, took the lead in integrating scientific and philosophical
					reasoning. It was the beginning of a period that became known as the Age of
					Reason, which produced the first great “modern” philosophers and revived the
					connection between philosophy and science, especially mathematics, that dated
					back to pre-Socratic Greece.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-384" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The birth of rationalism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the 17th century, many of the most significant philosophers in Europe were
					also accomplished mathematicians. In France, René Descartes and Blaise Pascal
					made major contributions to mathematics, as did Gottfried Leibniz in Germany.
					They believed that its reasoning process provided the best model for how to
					acquire all our knowledge of the world. Descartes’s investigation of the
					question “What can I know?” led him to a position of rationalism, which is the
					belief that knowledge comes from reason alone. This became the predominant
					belief in continental Europe for the next century. At the same time, a very
					different philosophical tradition was being established in Britain. Following
					the scientific reasoning espoused by Francis Bacon, John Locke came to the
					conclusion that our knowledge of the world comes not from reason, but
					experience. This view, known as empiricism, characterized British philosophy
					during the 17th and 18th centuries.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the division between continental rationalism and British empiricism
					(the same division that had separated the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle),
					both had in common the placing of the human at their centers: it is this being
					whose reason or experience leads to knowledge. Philosophers on both sides of the
					Channel had moved from asking questions about the nature of the universe&mdash;which
					were being answered by scientists such as Isaac Newton&mdash;to questioning how we can
					know what we know, and they now began to investigate the nature of the human
					mind and self. But these new philosophical strands had moral and political
					implications. Just as the Church’s authority had been undermined by the ideas of
					the Renaissance, so the aristocracies and monarchies were threatened by the new
					ideas of the Enlightenment, as this period came to be known. If the old rulers
					were removed from power, what sort of society was to replace them?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, Hobbes and Locke had laid the foundations for democratic thinking
					during the turbulent 17th century, but it was another 100 years before a
					questioning of the status quo began in earnest elsewhere.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				necessary to understand the background to his political concerns. Machiavelli was
				born in Florence, Italy, during a time of almost constant upheaval. The Medici
				family had been in open but unofficial control of the city-state for some 35 years,
				and the year of Machiavelli’s birth saw Lorenzo de’ Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent)
				succeed his father as ruler, ushering in a period of great artistic activity in
				Florence. Lorenzo was succeeded in 1492 by his son Piero (known as Piero the
				Unfortunate), whose reign was short-lived. The French under Charles VIII invaded
				Italy in considerable force in 1494, and Piero was forced to surrender and then flee
				the city, as the citizens rebelled against him. Florence was declared a republic
				that same year.</p><p class="calibre13">The Dominican prior of the San Marco monastery, Girolamo Savonarola, then came to
				dominate Florentine political life. The city-state entered a democratic period under
				his guidance, but after accusing the pope of corruption Savonarola was eventually
				arrested and burnt as a heretic. This led to Machiavelli’s first known involvement
				in Florentine politics, and he became Secretary to the second Chancery in
				1498.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-387"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000069.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-388" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Career and influences</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The invasion by Charles VIII in 1494 had sparked a turbulent period in the
					history of Italy, which at the time was divided into five powers: the papacy,
					Naples, Venice, Milan, and Florence. The country was fought over by various
					foreign powers, mainly France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire. Florence was
					weak in the face of their armies, and Machiavelli spent 14 years travelling
					between various cities on diplomatic missions, trying to shore up the struggling
					republic.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his diplomatic activities, Machiavelli met Cesare Borgia, the
					illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI. The pope was a powerful figure in
					northern Italy, and a significant threat to Florence. Although Cesare was
					Florence’s enemy, Machiavelli&mdash;despite his republican views&mdash;was impressed by his
					vigor, intelligence, and ability. Here we see one of the sources for
					Machiavelli’s famous work, <i class="calibre12">The Prince</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pope Alexander VI died in 1503, and his successor Pope Julius II was another
					strong and successful man who impressed Machiavelli with both his military
					ability and his cunning. But tension between France and the papacy led to
					Florence fighting with the French against the pope and his allies, the Spanish.
					The French lost, and Florence with them. In 1512 the Spanish dissolved the
					city-state’s government, the Medicis returned, and what was in effect a tyranny
					under Cardinal de’ Medici was installed. Machiavelli was fired from his
					political office and exiled to his farm in Florence. His political career might
					have revived under the rule of the Medicis, but in February 1513 he was falsely
					implicated in a plot against the family, and he was tortured, fined, and
					imprisoned.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli was released from prison within a month, but his chances of
					re-employment were slim, and his attempts to find a new political position came
					to nothing. He decided to present the head of the de’ Medici family in Florence,
					Giuliano, with a book. By the time it was ready Giuliano had died, so
					Machiavelli changed the dedication to Giuliano’s successor, Lorenzo. The book
					was of a type popular at the time: advice to a prince.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-389"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000315.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Lorenzo the Magnificent</span> (1449&ndash;1492)

					cynical, and showed a great understanding of Italy in general and Florence in
					particular. In it, Machiavelli sets out his argument that the goals of a ruler
					justify the means used to obtain them. <i class="calibre12">The
						Prince</i> differed markedly from other books of its type in its
					resolute setting aside of Christian morality. Machiavelli wanted to give
					ruthlessly practical advice to a prince and, as his experience with extremely
					successful popes and cardinals had shown him, Christian values should be cast
					aside if they got in the way.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Machiavelli’s approach centers on the notion of <i class="calibre12">virtù</i>, but this is not the modern notion of moral virtue. It
					shares more similarities with the medieval notion of virtues as the powers or
					functions of things, such as the healing powers of plants or minerals.
					Machiavelli is writing about the virtues of princes, and these were the powers
					and functions that concerned rule. The Latin root of <i class="calibre12">virtù</i> also relates it to manliness (as in “virile”), and this
					feeds into what Machiavelli has to say in its application both to the prince
					himself and to the state&mdash;where sometimes <i class="calibre12">virtù</i> is used to mean “success”, and describes a state that is
					to be admired and imitated.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of Machiavelli’s point is that a ruler cannot be bound by morality, but
					must do what it takes to secure his own glory and the success of the state over
					which he rules&mdash;an approach that became known as realism. But Machiavelli does
					not argue that the end justifies the means in all cases. There are certain means
					that a wise prince must avoid, for though they might achieve the desired ends,
					they lay him open to future dangers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The main means to be avoided consist of those that would make the people hate
					their prince. They may love him, they may fear him&mdash;preferably both, Machiavelli
					says, though it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved.
					But the people must not hate him, for this is likely to lead to rebellion. Also,
					a prince who mistreats his people unnecessarily will be despised&mdash;a prince should
					have a reputation for compassion, not for cruelty. This might involve harsh
					punishment of a few in order to achieve general social order, which benefits
					more people in the long run.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where Machiavelli does think that the end justifies the means, this
					rule applies only to princes. The proper conduct of citizens of the state is not
					at all the same as that of the prince. But even for ordinary citizens,
					Machiavelli generally disdains conventional Christian morality as being weak and
					unsuitable for a strong city.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"How difficult it is for a people accustomed to live under a prince to

					equality does not exist in a state, and cannot be introduced. However, it can be
					argued that <i class="calibre12">The Prince</i> represents
					Machiavelli’s genuine ideas about how the ruler should rule in such cases; if
					princedoms are sometimes a necessary evil, it is best that they be ruled as well

					government. Machiavelli, it could be argued, would have written what the
					dedicatee wanted to read.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="calibre12">The Prince</i>, however, contains much that
					Machiavelli is thought to have genuinely believed, such as the need for a
					citizens’ militia rather than reliance on mercenaries. The problem lies in
					discerning which parts are his actual beliefs and which are not. It is tempting
					to divide them according to how well they fit with the intended reader’s own
					beliefs, but that is unlikely to give an accurate result.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested that Machiavelli was attempting satire, and his
					real intended audience was the republicans, not the ruling elite. This idea is
					supported by the fact that Machiavelli did not write it in Latin, the language
					of the elite, but in Italian, the language of the people. Certainly, <i class="calibre12">The Prince</i> at times reads satirically, as though
					the audience is expected to conclude: “if that is how a good prince should
					behave, we should at all costs avoid being ruled by one!” If Machiavelli was
					also satirizing the idea that “the end justifies the means”, then the purpose of

				popular since ancient times: the intellectual and moral dangers of living among
				others, and the value of solitude. Montaigne is not stressing the importance of
				physical solitude, but rather of developing the ability to resist the temptation to
				mindlessly fall in with the opinion and actions of the mob. He compares our desire
				for the approval of our fellow humans to being overly attached to material wealth
				and possessions. Both passions diminish us, Montaigne claims, but he does not
				conclude that we should relinquish either, only that we should cultivate a
				detachment from them. By doing so, we may enjoy them&mdash;and even benefit from them&mdash;but
				we will not become emotionally enslaved to them, or devastated if we lose
				them.</p><p class="calibre13">“On Solitude” then considers how our desire for mass approval is linked to the
				pursuit of glory, or fame. Contrary to thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, who see
				glory as a worthy goal, Montaigne believes that constant striving for fame is the
				greatest barrier to peace of mind, or tranquility. He says of those who present
				glory as a desirable goal that they “only have their arms and legs out of the crowd;
				their souls, their wills, are more engaged with it than ever.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Montaigne is not concerned with whether or not we achieve glory. His point is that
				we should shake off the desire for glory in the eyes of other people&mdash;that we should
				not always think of other people’s approval and admiration as being valuable. He
				goes on to recommend that instead of looking for the approbation of those around us,
				we should imagine that some truly great and noble being is constantly with us, able
				to observe our most private thoughts, a being in whose presence even the mad would
				hide their failings. By doing this, we will learn to think clearly and objectively
				and behave in a more thoughtful and rational manner. Montaigne claims that caring
				too much about the opinion of those around us will corrupt us, either because we end
				up imitating those who are evil, or become so consumed by hatred for them that we
				lose our reason.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-399"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000188.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-400"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000166.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Montaigne experienced</span> the results of

					writes. He also points out that encouraging statesmen and political leaders to

				thought known as British empiricism, which is characterized by the view that all
				knowledge must come ultimately from sensory experience. He was born at a time when
				there was a shift from the Renaissance preoccupation with the rediscovered
				achievements of the ancient world toward a more scientific approach to knowledge.
				There had already been some innovative work by Renaissance scientists such as the
				astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus and the anatomist Andreas Vesalius, but this new
				period&mdash;sometimes called the Scientific Revolution&mdash;produced an astonishing number of
				scientific thinkers, including Galileo Galilei, William Harvey, Robert Boyle, Robert
				Hooke, and Isaac Newton.</p><p class="calibre13">Although the Church had been broadly welcoming to science for much of the medieval
				period, this was halted by the rise of opposition to the Vatican’s authority during
				the Renaissance. Several religious reformers, such as Martin Luther, had complained
				that the Church had been too lax in countering scientific challenges to accounts of
				the world based on the Bible. In response, the Catholic Church, which had already
				lost adherents to Luther’s new form of Christianity, changed its stance and turned
				against scientific endeavor. This opposition, from both sides of the religious
				divide, hampered the development of the sciences.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacon claims to accept the teachings of the Christian Church. But he also argues
				that science must be separated from religion, in order to make the acquisition of
				knowledge quicker and easier, so that it can be used to improve the quality of
				people’s lives. Bacon stresses this transforming role for science. One of his
				complaints is that science’s ability to enhance human existence had previously been
				ignored, in favor of a focus on academic and personal glory.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacon presents a list of the psychological barriers to pursuing scientific

				wrote on a wide range of subjects. Many of his views are controversial, not least
				his defence of physicalism&mdash;the theory that everything in the world is exclusively
				physical in nature, allowing no room for the existence of other natural entities,
				such as the mind, or for supernatural beings. According to Hobbes, all animals,
				including humans, are nothing more than flesh-and-blood machines.</p><p class="calibre13">The kind of metaphysical theory that Hobbes favors was becoming increasingly
				popular at the time of his writing, in the mid-17th century. Knowledge in the
				physical sciences was growing rapidly, bringing clearer explanations of phenomena
				that had long been obscure or misunderstood. Hobbes had met the Italian astronomer
				Galileo, frequently regarded as the “father of modern science”, and had been closely
				associated with Francis Bacon, whose thinking had helped to revolutionize scientific
				practice.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;In science and mathematics, Hobbes saw the perfect counter to the medieval
				Scholastic philosophy that had sought to reconcile the apparent contradictions
				between reason and faith. In common with many thinkers of his time, he believed
				there was no limit to what science could achieve, taking it as a matter of fact that
				any question about the nature of the world could be answered with a scientifically
				formulated explanation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-413"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000395.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-414" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hobbes’ theory</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In <i class="calibre12">Leviathan</i>, his major political work,
					Hobbes proclaims: “The universe&mdash;that is, the whole mass of things that are&mdash;is
					corporeal, that is to say, body.” He goes on to say that each of these bodies
					has “length, breadth, and depth”, and “that which is not body is no part of the
					universe.” Although Hobbes is stating that the nature of everything is purely
					physical, he is not claiming that because of this physicality everything can be
					perceived by us. Some bodies or objects, Hobbes declares, are imperceptible,
					even though they occupy physical space and have physical dimensions. These, he
					calls “spirits.” Some of them, labelled “animal spirits” (in line with a common
					view at the time) are responsible for most animal, and especially human,
					activity. These animal spirits move around the body, carrying with them and
					passing on information, in much the same way as we now think of the nervous
					system doing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Hobbes seems to apply his concept of physical spirits to God and
					other entities found in religion, such as angels. However, he does state that
					God himself, but not other physical spirits, should be described as
					“incorporeal.” For Hobbes, the divine nature of God’s attributes is not
					something that the human mind is capable of fully understanding, therefore the
					term “incorporeal” is the only one that recognizes and also honors the
					unknowable substance of God. Hobbes does make clear, however, that he believes
					the existence and nature of all religious entities are matters for faith, not
					science, and that God, in particular, will remain beyond our comprehension. All
					it is possible for human beings to know about God is that he exists, and that he
					is the first cause, or creator, of everything in the universe.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Life is but a motion of limbs."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Thomas Hobbes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-415"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000405.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Hobbes believed</span> that “spirits” carried

					therefore no more than biological machines, he is then faced with the problem of
					how to account for our mental nature. He makes no attempt to give an account of
					how the mind can be explained. He simply offers a general and rather sketchy
					account of what he thought science would eventually reveal to be the case. Even
					then, he only covers the mental activities such as voluntary motion, appetite,
					and aversion&mdash;all phenomena that can be studied and explained from a mechanistic
					point of view. Hobbes has nothing to say about what the modern-day Australian
					philosopher David Chalmers calls “the hard problem of consciousness.” Chalmers
					points out that certain functions of consciousness&mdash;such as the use of language
					and the processing of information&mdash;can be explained relatively easily in terms of
					the mechanisms that perform those functions, and that physicalist philosophers
					have been offering variants of this approach for centuries. However, the harder
					problem of explaining the nature of subjective, first-person experience of
					consciousness remains unsolved by them. There seems to be a built-in mismatch
					between the objects of the physical sciences on the one hand and the subjects of
					conscious experience on the other&mdash;something that Hobbes does not seem to be
					aware of.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hobbes’ account of his belief offers very little argument for his conviction
					that everything in the world, including human beings, is wholly physical. He
					appears not to notice that his grounds for the existence of imperceptible
					material spirits could equally be grounds for a belief in nonmaterial
					substances. To most people, something being imperceptible is more consistent
					with a mental than with a physical concept. In addition, because Hobbes’
					material spirits can only ever possess the same properties as other types of
					physical thing, they fail to offer any assistance toward an explanation of the
					mental nature of human beings.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings;

					body that Descartes set out in his <i class="calibre12">Meditations</i> of 1641. Descartes argues for the “Real Distinction”
					between mind and body&mdash;the notion that they are utterly distinct sorts of
					substance. In objections to Descartes’ ideas that he expressed at the time,
					Hobbes makes no comment on this distinction. However, 14 years later, he
					addressed the problem again in a passage in his book <i class="calibre12">De
						Corpore</i>, presenting and criticizing what seems to be a muddled
					form of part of Descartes’ argument. Here he rejects the conclusion Descartes
					came to&mdash;that mind and body are two distinct substances&mdash;on the basis that
					Descartes’ use of the phrase “incorporeal substance” is an example of
					insignificant or empty language. Hobbes takes it to mean “a body without body”,
					which appears to be nonsense. However, this definition must be based upon his
					own view that all substances are bodies; so what Hobbes appears to present as an
					argument for his position that there can be no incorporeal minds, in fact
					depends upon his inaccurate assumption that the only form of substance is body,
					and that there is no possibility of incorporeal things existing at all.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-418" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A simple prejudice</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As Hobbes’ definition of physical spirits indicates, it is ultimately unclear
					exactly what he took “physical” or “corporeal” to mean. If it was meant to be
					simply anything that had three spatial dimensions, then he would be excluding
					much of what we, at the beginning of the 21st century, might regard as being
					“physical.” For example, his theories about the nature of the world would rule
					out the science of sub-atomic physics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of any truly clear notion of what his key term means, Hobbes’
					insistence that everything in the world can be explained in physical terms
					begins to look less and less like a statement of scientific principle. Instead,
					it starts to appear to be merely an unscientific&mdash;and unphilosophical&mdash;prejudice
					against the mental. But his mechanistic theories about the nature of our world
					were very much in keeping with the spirit of an age that was to radically
					challenge most of the prevailing views on human nature and social order, as well
					as those concerned with the substance and workings of the universe that we
					inhabit. It was this revolution in thinking that laid the foundations of our

				sometimes called the Scientific Revolution, an era of rapid advances in the
				sciences. The British scientist and philosopher Francis Bacon had established a new
				method for conducting scientific experiments, based on detailed observations and
				deductive reasoning, and his methodologies had provided a new framework for
				investigating the world. Descartes shared his excitement and optimism, but for
				different reasons. Bacon considered the practical applications of scientific
				discoveries to be their whole purpose and point, whereas Descartes was more
				fascinated by the project of extending knowledge and understanding of the
				world.</p><p class="calibre13">During the Renaissance&mdash;the preceding historical era&mdash;people had become more
				skeptical about science and the possibility of genuine knowledge in general, and
				this view continued to exert an influence in Descartes’ time. So a major motivation
				of his “project of pure enquiry”, as his work has become known, was the desire to
				rid the sciences of the annoyance of skepticism once and for all.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i class="calibre12">Meditations on First Philosophy</i>,
				Descartes’ most accomplished and rigorous work on metaphysics (the study of being
				and reality) and epistemology (the study of the nature and limits of knowledge), he
				seeks to demonstrate the possibility of knowledge even from the most skeptical of
				positions, and from this, to establish a firm foundation for the sciences. The
					<i class="calibre12">Meditations</i> is written in the first-person
				form&mdash;“I think…”&mdash;because he is not presenting arguments in order to prove or disprove
				certain statements, but instead wishes to lead the reader along the path that he
				himself has taken. In this way the reader is forced to adopt the standpoint of the
				meditator, thinking things through and discovering the truth just as Descartes had
				done. This approach is reminiscent of the Socratic method, in which the philosopher
				gradually draws out a person’s understanding rather than presenting it already
				packaged and ready to take away.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-424"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000272.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-425"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000241.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Descartes’ book </span><i class="calibre20">De Homine Figuris</i> takes a biological look at the causes of knowledge.

					Descartes takes to be two important marks of knowledge, he uses what is known as
					“the method of doubt.” This starts with the meditator setting aside any belief
					whose truth can be doubted, whether slightly or completely. Descartes’ aim is to
					show that, even if we start from the strongest possible skeptical position,
					doubting everything, we can still reach knowledge. The doubt is “hyperbolic”
					(exaggerated), and used only as a philosophical tool; as Descartes points out:
					“no sane person has ever seriously doubted these things.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Descartes starts by subjecting his beliefs to a series of increasingly
					rigorous skeptical arguments, questioning how we can be sure of the existence of
					anything at all. Could it be that the world we know is just an illusion? We
					cannot trust our senses, as we have all been “deceived” by them at one time or
					another, and so we cannot rely on them as a sure footing for knowledge. Perhaps,
					he says, we are dreaming, and the apparently real world is no more than a dream
					world. He notes that this is possible, as there are no sure signs between being
					awake or asleep. But even so, this situation would leave open the possibility
					that some truths, such as mathematical axioms, could be known, though not
					through the senses. But even these “truths” might not in fact be true, because
					God, who is all-powerful, could deceive us even at this level. Even though we
					believe that God is good, it is possible that he made us in such a way that we
					are prone to errors in our reasoning. Or perhaps there is no God&mdash;in which case
					we are even more likely to be imperfect beings (having arisen only by chance)
					that are capable of being deceived all the time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reached a position in which there seems to be nothing at all of which
					he can be certain, Descartes then devises a vivid tool to help him to avoid
					slipping back into preconceived opinion: he supposes that there is a powerful
					and evil demon who can deceive him about anything. When he finds himself
					considering a belief, he can ask: “Could the demon be making me believe this
					even though it was false?” and if the answer is “yes” he must set aside the
					belief as open to doubt.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it seems as though Descartes has put himself into an impossible
					position&mdash;nothing seems beyond doubt, so he has no solid ground on which to
					stand. He describes himself as feeling helplessly tumbled around by a whirlpool
					of universal doubt, unable to find his footing. Skepticism seems to have made it
					impossible for him even to begin his journey back to knowledge and truth.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"It is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as

					surely cannot doubt: his belief in his own existence. Each of us can think or
					say: “I am, I exist”, and while we are thinking or saying it we cannot be wrong
					about it. When Descartes tries to apply the evil demon test to this belief, he
					realizes that the demon could only make him believe that he exists if he does in
					fact exist; how can he doubt his existence unless he exists in order to do the
					doubting?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This axiom&mdash;“I am, I exist” &ndash;forms Descartes’ First Certainty. In his earlier
					work, the <i class="calibre12">Discourse on the Method</i>, he
					presented it as: “I think therefore I am”, but he abandoned this wording when he
					wrote the <i class="calibre12">Meditations</i>, as the inclusion of
					“therefore” makes the statement read like a premise and conclusion. Descartes
					wants the reader&mdash;the meditating “I”&mdash;to realize that as soon as I consider the
					fact that I exist, I know it to be true. This truth is instantly grasped. The
					realization that I exist is a direct intuition, not the conclusion of an
					argument.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Descartes’ move to a clearer expression of his position, the earlier
					formulation was so catchy that it stuck in people’s minds, and to this day the
					First Certainty is generally known as “the cogito”, from the Latin <i class="calibre12">cogito ergo sum</i>, meaning “I think therefore I am.”
					St. Augustine of Hippo had used a very similar argument in <i class="calibre12">The City of God</i>, when he said: “For if I am
					mistaken, I exist”; meaning that if he did not exist, he could not be mistaken.
					Augustine, however, made little use of this in his thinking, and certainly did
					not reach it in the way that Descartes did.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What use, though, is a single belief? The simplest logical argument is a
					syllogism, which has two premises and a conclusion&mdash;such as: all birds have
					wings; a robin is a bird; therefore all robins have wings. We surely cannot get
					anywhere from the starting point of just one true belief. But Descartes was not
					looking to reach these kinds of conclusions from his First Certainty. As he
					explained: “Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order
					to shift the entire Earth.” For Descartes, the certainty of his own existence
					gives him the equivalent; it saves him from that whirlpool of doubt, gives him a
					firm foothold, and so allows him to start on the journey back from skepticism to
					knowledge. It is crucial to his project of enquiry, but it is not the foundation
					of his epistemology.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"I shall suppose that some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning
						has employed all his energies in order to deceive me."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">René Descartes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-430" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">What is this “I”?</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Despite the fact that the First Certainty’s main function is to provide a firm
					footing for knowledge, Descartes realizes that we might also be able to gain
					knowledge from the certainty itself. This is because the knowledge that I am
					thinking is bound up with the knowledge of my existence. So “thinking” is also
					something that I cannot rationally doubt, for doubting is a kind of thinking, so
					to doubt that I am thinking is to be thinking. As Descartes now knows that he
					exists and that he is thinking, then he&mdash;and every other meditator&mdash;also knows
					that he is a thinking thing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Descartes makes clear, though, that this is as far as he can reason from the
					First Certainty. He is certainly not entitled to say that he is only a thinking
					thing&mdash;a mind&mdash;as he has no way of knowing what more he might be. He might be a
					physical thing that also has the ability to think, or he might be something
					else, something that he has not even conceived yet. The point is that at this
					stage of his meditations he knows only that he is a thinking thing; as he puts
					it, he knows only that he is, “in the strict sense only” a thinking thing.
					Later, in the sixth book of the <i class="calibre12">Meditations</i>,
					Descartes presents an argument that mind and body are different sorts of
					thing&mdash;that they are distinct substances&mdash;but he is not yet in a position to do
					so.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-431"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000203.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The only question</span> that Descartes is

					hold that Descartes’ approach to skepticism is doomed from the start. One of the
					main arguments against it takes issue with the very use of the term “I” in “I
					am, I exist.” Although Descartes cannot be wrong in saying that thinking is
					occurring, how does he know that there is “a thinker”&mdash;a single, unified
					consciousness doing that thinking? What gives him the right to assert the
					existence of anything beyond the thoughts? On the other hand, can we make sense
					of the notion of thoughts floating around without a thinker?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to imagine detached, coherent thoughts, and Descartes argues
					that it is impossible to conceive of such a state of affairs. However, if one
					were to disagree, and believe that a world of thoughts with no thinkers is
					genuinely possible, Descartes would not be entitled to the belief that he
					exists, and would thus fail to reach his First Certainty. The existence of
					thoughts would not give him the solid ground he needed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with this notion of thoughts floating around with no thinker is
					that reasoning would be impossible. In order to reason, it is necessary to
					relate ideas in a particular way. For example, if Patrick has the thought “all
					men are mortal” and Patricia has the thought “Socrates is a man”, neither can
					conclude anything. But if Paula has both thoughts, she can conclude that
					“Socrates is mortal.” Merely having the thoughts “all men are mortal” and
					“Socrates is a man” floating around is like two separate people having them; in
					order for reason to be possible we need to make these thoughts relative to one
					another, to link them in the right way. It turns out that making thoughts
					relative to anything other than a thinker (for example, to a place or to a time)
					fails to do the job. And since reasoning is possible, Descartes can conclude
					that there is a thinker.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some modern philosophers have denied that Descartes’ certainty of his own
					existence can do the job he requires of it; they argue that “I exist” has no
					content, as it merely refers to its subject but says nothing meaningful or
					important about it; it is simply pointing at the subject. For this reason
					nothing can follow from it, and Descartes’ project fails at the beginning. This
					seems to miss Descartes’ point; as we have seen, he does not use the First
					Certainty as a premise from which to derive further knowledge&mdash;all he needs is
					that there be a self for him to point to. So even if “I exist” only succeeds in
					pointing to the meditator, then he has an escape from the whirlpool of
					doubt.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"When someone says ‘I am thinking, therefore I am’, he recognizes it as
						something self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">René Descartes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-433" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An unreal thinker</h2></div><p class="calibre14">For those who have misunderstood Descartes to have been offering an argument
					from the fact of his thinking to the fact of his existence, we can point out
					that the First Certainty is a direct intuition, not a logical argument. Why,
					though, would it be a problem if Descartes had been offering an argument?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, the apparent inference “I am thinking, therefore I exist” is
					missing a major premise; that is, in order for the argument to work it needs
					another premise, such as “anything that is thinking exists.” Sometimes an
					obvious premise is not actually stated in an argument, in which case it is known
					as a suppressed premise. But some of Descartes’ critics complain that this
					suppressed premise is not at all obvious. For example, Hamlet, in Shakespeare’s
					play, thought a great deal, but it is also clearly true that he did not exist;
					so it is not true that anything that thinks exists.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;We might say that in so far as Hamlet thought, he thought in the fictional
					world of a play, but he also existed in that fictional world; in so far as he
					did not exist, he did not exist in the real world. His “reality” and thinking
					are linked to the same world. But Descartes’ critics might respond that that is
					precisely the point: knowing that someone called Hamlet was thinking&mdash;and no more
					than this&mdash;does not assure us that this person exists in the real world; for
					that, we should have to know that he was thinking in the real world. Knowing
					that something or someone&mdash;like Descartes&mdash;is thinking, is not enough to prove
					their reality in this world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this dilemma lies in the first-person nature of the <i class="calibre12">Meditations</i>, and the reasons for Descartes’ use of
					the “I” throughout now becomes clear. Because while I might be unsure whether
					Hamlet was thinking, and therefore existed, in a fictional world or the real
					world, I cannot be unsure about myself.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"We ought to enquire as to what sort of knowledge human reason is capable

					would approach his work in such a way that most would “not bother to grasp the
					proper order of my arguments and the connection between them, but merely try to
					carp at individual sentences, as is the fashion.” On the other hand, he also
					wrote that “I do not expect any popular approval, or indeed any wide audience”,
					and in this he was much mistaken. He is often described as the father of modern
					philosophy. He sought to give philosophy the certainty of mathematics without
					recourse to any kind of dogma or authority, and to establish a firm, rational
					foundation for knowledge. He is also well known for proposing that the mind and
					the body are two distinct substances&mdash;one material (the body) and the other
					immaterial (the mind)&mdash;which are nonetheless capable of interaction. This famous
					distinction, which he explains in the <i class="calibre12">Sixth
						Meditation</i>, became known as Cartesian dualism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is the rigor of Descartes’ thought and his rejection of any
					reliance on authority that are perhaps his most important legacy. The centuries
					after his death were dominated by philosophers who either developed his ideas or
					those who took as their main task the refutation of his thoughts, such as Thomas

				is not primarily a philosophical work. Rather, it is a compilation of fragments from

				at what he called <i class="calibre12">libertins</i>&mdash;ex-Catholics who had
				left religion as a result of the sort of free thinking encouraged by skeptical
				writers such as Montaigne. In one of the longer fragments, Pascal discusses
				imagination. He offers little or no argument for his claims, being concerned merely
				to set down his thoughts on the matter.</p><p class="calibre13">Pascal’s point is that imagination is the most powerful force in human beings, and
				one of our chief sources of error. Imagination, he says, causes us to trust people
				despite what reason tells us. For example, because lawyers and doctors dress up in
				special clothes, we tend to trust them more. Conversely, we pay less attention to
				someone who looks shabby or odd, even if he is talking good sense.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes things worse is that, though it usually leads to falsehood, imagination
				occasionally leads to truth; if it were always false, then we could use it as a

				his discussion of it by writing: “Imagination decides everything: it produces
				beauty, justice, and happiness, which is the greatest thing in the world.” Out of
				context, it might seem that he is praising imagination, but we can see from what
				preceded this passage that his intention is very different. As imagination usually
				leads to error, then the beauty, justice, and happiness that it produces will
				usually be false. In the wider context of a work of Christian theology, and
				especially in light of Pascal’s emphasis on the use of reason to bring people to
				religious belief, we can see that his aim is to show the <i class="calibre12">libertins</i> that the life of pleasure that they have chosen is not
				what they think it is. Although they believe that they have chosen the path of
				reason, they have in fact been misled by the power of the imagination.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-440"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000064.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Man is but a reed, the weakest nature; yet he is a thinking reed."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Blaise Pascal</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-441" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Pascal’s Wager</h2></div><p class="calibre14">This view is relevant to one of the most complete notes in the <i class="calibre12">Pensées</i>, the famous argument known as Pascal’s

				system has the notion of “substance” at its heart. This concept can be traced back
				to Aristotle, who asked “What is it about an object that stays the same when it
				undergoes change?” Wax, for example, can melt and change its shape, size, color,
				smell, and texture, and yet still remain “wax”, prompting the question: what are we
				referring to when we speak of “the wax”? Since it can change in every way that we
				can perceive, the wax must also be something beyond its perceptible properties, and
				for Aristotle this unchanging thing is the wax’s “substance.” More generally,
				substance is anything that has properties&mdash;or that which underlies the world of
				appearance.</p><p class="calibre13">Spinoza employs “substance” in a similar way, defining it as that which is
				self-explanatory&mdash;or that which can be understood by knowing its nature alone, as
				opposed to all other things that can be known only by their relationships with other
				things. For example, the concept “cart” can only be understood with reference to
				other concepts, such as “motion”, “transport”, and so on. Moreover, for Spinoza,
				there can only be one such substance, for if there were two, understanding one would
				entail understanding its relationship with the other, which contradicts the
				definition of substance. Furthermore, he argues, since there is only one such
				substance, there can, in fact, be nothing <i class="calibre12">but</i>
				that substance, and everything else is in some sense a part of it. Spinoza’s
				position is known as “substance monism”, which claims that all things are ultimately
				aspects of a single thing, as opposed to “substance dualism”, which claims that
				there are ultimately two kinds of things in the universe, most commonly defined as
				“mind” and “matter.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-447"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000085.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-448" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Substance as God or nature</h2></div><p class="calibre14">For Spinoza, then, substance underlies our experience, but it can also be
					known by its various attributes. He does not specify how many attributes
					substance has, but he says that human beings, at least, can conceive of
					two&mdash;namely, the attribute of extension (physicality) and the attribute of
					thought (mentality). For this reason, Spinoza is also known as an “attribute
					dualist”, and he claims that these two attributes cannot be explained by each
					other, and so must be included in any complete account of the world. As for
					substance itself, Spinoza says that we are right to call it “God” or “nature”
						(<i class="calibre12">Deus sive natura</i>)&mdash;that self-explaining
					thing which, in human form, sees itself under the attributes of body and
					mind.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the level of individual things, including human beings, Spinoza’s attribute
					dualism is intended in part to deal with the question of how minds and bodies
					interact. The things that we experience as individual bodies or minds are in
					fact modifications of the single substance as conceived under one of the
					attributes. Each modification is both a physical thing (in so far as it is
					conceived under the attribute of extension) and a mental thing (in so far as it
					is conceived under the attribute of thought). In particular, a human mind is a
					modification of substance conceived under the attribute of thought, and the
					human brain is the same modification of substance conceived under the attribute
					of extension. In this way, Spinoza avoids any question about the interaction
					between mind and body: there is no interaction, only a one-to-one
					correspondence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Spinoza’s theory commits him to the view that it is not only human
					beings that are minds as well as bodies, but everything else too. Tables, rocks,
					trees&mdash;all of these are modifications of the one substance under the attributes
					of thought and extension. So, they are all both physical and mental things,
					although their mentality is very simple and they are not what we should call
					minds. This aspect of Spinoza’s theory is difficult for many people either to
					accept or to understand.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-449"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000291.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">All changes</span>, from a change of mood to a
							change in a candle’s shape, are, for Spinoza, alterations that occur to
							a single substance that has both mental and physical attributes.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-450" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The world is God</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Spinoza’s theory, which he explains fully in <i class="calibre12">Ethics</i>, is often referred to as a form of pantheism&mdash;the belief
					that God is the world, and that the world is God. Pantheism is often criticized
					by theists (people who believe in God), who argue that it is little more than
					atheism by another name. However, Spinoza’s theory is in fact much closer to
					panentheism&mdash;the view that the world is God, but that God is more than the world.
					For in Spinoza’s system, the world is not a mass of material and mental
					stuff&mdash;rather, the world of material things is a form of God as conceived under
					the attribute of extension, and the world of mental things is that same form of
					God as conceived under the attribute of thought. Therefore the one substance or
					God is more than the world, but the world itself is entirely substance or
					God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Spinoza’s God is clearly different from the God of standard
					Judaeo-Christian theology. Not only is it not a person, it cannot be regarded as
					being the creator of the world in the sense found in the Book of Genesis.
					Spinoza’s God does not exist alone before creation, and then bring it into
					existence.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"Mind and body are one."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Benedictus Spinoza</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-451" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">God as the cause</h2></div><p class="calibre14">What can Spinoza mean, then, when he says that God is the cause of everything?
					The one substance is “God or nature”&mdash;so even if there is more to God than those
					modifications of substance that make up our world, how can the relationship
					between God and nature be causal?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should note that Spinoza, in common with most philosophers before
					him, uses the word “cause” in a much richer sense than we do now&mdash;a sense that
					originates in Aristotle’s definition of four types of cause. These are (using a
					statue as an example): a formal cause, or the relationship between a thing’s
					parts (its shape or form); a material cause, or the matter a thing is made of
					(the bronze, marble, and so on); an efficient cause, or that which brings a
					thing into being (the sculpting process); and a final cause, or the purpose for
					which a thing exists (the creation of a work of art, the desire for money, and
					so on).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Aristotle and Spinoza, these together define “cause”, and provide a
					complete explanation of a thing&mdash;unlike today’s usage, which tends to relate to
					the “efficient” or “final” causes only. Therefore, when Spinoza speaks of God or
					substance being “self-caused” he means that it is self-explanatory, rather than
					that it is simply self-generating. When he talks of God being the cause of all
					things, he means that all things find their explanation in God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;God, therefore, is not what Spinoza calls a “transitive” cause of the
					world&mdash;something external that brings the world into being. Rather, God is the
					“immanent” cause of the world. This means that God is in the world, that the
					world is in God, and that the existence and essence of the world are explained
					by God’s existence and essence. For Spinoza, to fully appreciate this fact is to
					attain the highest state of freedom and salvation possible&mdash;a state he calls
					“blessedness.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"The human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Benedictus Spinoza</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-452"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000328.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">According to Spinoza</span>, all objects,

				known as the British Empiricists, together with two later philosophers, George
				Berkeley and David Hume. The empiricists are generally thought to hold the view that
				all human knowledge must come directly or indirectly from the experience of the
				world that we acquire through the use of our senses alone. This contrasts with the
				thinking of the rationalist philosophers, such as René Descartes, Benedictus
				Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz, who hold that in principle, at least, it is possible
				to acquire knowledge solely through the use of reason.</p><p class="calibre13">In fact, the division between these two groups is not as clear-cut as is often
				assumed. The rationalists all accept that in practice our knowledge of the world
				ultimately stems from our experience, and most notably from scientific enquiry.
				Locke reaches his distinctive views concerning the nature of the world by applying a
				process of reasoning later known as abduction (inference to the best explanation
				from the available evidence) to the facts of sensory experience. For example, Locke
				sets out to demonstrate that the best explanation of the world as we experience it
				is corpuscular theory. This is the theory that everything in the world is made up of
				submicroscopic particles, or corpuscles, which we can have no direct knowledge of,
				but which, by their very existence, make sense of phenomena that would otherwise be
				difficult or impossible to explain. Corpuscular theory was becoming popular in
				17th-century scientific thinking and is fundamental to Locke’s view of the physical
				world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-457"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000250.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-458" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Innate ideas</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The claim that man’s knowledge cannot go beyond his experience may therefore
					seem inappropriate, or at least an exaggeration, when attributed to Locke.
					However, Locke does argue at some length, in his <i class="calibre12">Essay
						Concerning Human Understanding</i>, against the theory proposed by
					the rationalists to explain how knowledge could be accessed without experience.
					This is the theory of innate ideas.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept that human beings are born with innate ideas, and that these can
					give us knowledge about the nature of the world around us, independently of
					anything we may experience, dates back to the dawn of philosophy. Plato had
					developed a concept, according to which all genuine knowledge is essentially
					located within us, but that when we die our souls are reincarnated into new
					bodies and the shock of birth causes us to forget it all. Education is therefore
					not about learning new facts, but about “unforgetting”, and the educator is not
					a teacher but a midwife.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many later thinkers countered Plato’s theory, proposing that all
					knowledge cannot be innate and that only a limited number of concepts can be.
					These include the concept of God and also that of a perfect geometric structure,
					such as an equilateral triangle. This type of knowledge, in their view, can be
					gained without any direct sensory experience, in the way that it is possible to
					devise a mathematical formula by using nothing more than the powers of reason
					and logic. René Descartes, for example, declares that although he believes that
					we all have an idea of God imprinted in us&mdash;like the mark that a craftsman makes
					in the clay of a pot&mdash;this knowledge of God’s existence can only be brought into
					our conscious mind through a process of reasoning.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"If we attentively consider newborn children, we shall have little reason
						to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">John Locke</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-459" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Locke’s objections</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Locke was against the idea that human beings possess any kind of innate
					knowledge. He takes the view that the mind at birth is a tabula rasa&mdash;a blank
					tablet or a new sheet of paper upon which experience writes, in the same way
					that light can create images on photographic film. According to Locke, we bring
					nothing to the process except the basic human ability to apply reason to the
					information that we gather through our senses. He argues that there is not the
					slightest empirical evidence to suggest that the minds of infants are other than
					blank at birth, and adds that this is also true of the minds of the mentally
					deficient, stating that “they have not the least apprehension or thought of
					them.” Locke, therefore, declares that any doctrine supporting the existence of
					innate ideas must be false.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Locke also goes on to attack the very notion of innate ideas by arguing that
					it is incoherent. In order for something to be an idea at all, he states that it
					has to have been present at some point in somebody’s mind. But, as Locke points
					out, any idea that claims to be truly innate must also be claiming to precede
					any form of human experience. Locke accepts that it is true, as Gottfried
					Leibniz states, that an idea may exist so deep in a person’s memory that for a
					time it is difficult or even impossible to recall, and so is not accessible to
					the conscious mind. Innate ideas, on the other hand, are believed to somehow
					exist somewhere, before the presence of any sort of mechanism that is capable of
					conceiving them and bringing them into consciousness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The supporters of the existence of innate ideas often also argue that as such
					ideas are present in all human beings at birth, they must be by nature
					universal, which means that they are found in all human societies at all points
					in history. Plato, for example, claims that everyone potentially has access to
					the same basic body of knowledge, denying any difference in that respect between
					men and women, or between slaves and freemen. Similarly, in Locke’s time, the
					theory was frequently put forward that because innate ideas can only be placed
					in us by God, they must be universal, as God is not capable of being so unfair
					as to hand them out only to a select group of people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Locke counters the argument for universal ideas by once again bringing to our
					attention that a simple examination of the world around us will readily show
					that they do not exist. Even if there were concepts, or ideas, which absolutely
					every human being in the world held in common, Locke argues that we would have
					no firm grounds for concluding that they were also innate. He declares that it
					would always be possible to discover other explanations for their universality,
					such as the fact that they stem from the most basic ways in which a human being
					experiences the world around him, which is something that we all must
					share.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1704, Gottfried Leibniz wrote a rebuttal of Locke’s empiricist arguments in
					his <i class="calibre12">New Essays on the Human Understanding</i>.
					Leibniz declares that innate ideas are the one clear way that we can gain
					knowledge that is not based upon sensory experience, and that Locke is wrong to
					deny their possibility. The debate about whether human beings can know anything
					beyond what they perceive through their five basic senses continues.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-460"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000224.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Locke believed the human mind</span> is like a

					capacities such as perception and reasoning are central to his accounts of the

					American philosophy Noam Chomsky took this idea further when he put forward his
					theory that there is an innate process of thinking in every human mind, which is
					capable of generating a universal “deep structure” of language. Chomsky believes
					that regardless of their apparent structural differences, all human languages
					have been generated from this common basis.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Locke played an important role in questioning how human beings acquire
					knowledge, at a time when man’s understanding of the world was expanding at an
					unprecedented rate. Earlier philosophers&mdash;notably the medieval Scholastic
					thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas&mdash;had concluded that some aspects of reality were
					beyond the grasp of the human mind. But Locke took this a stage further. By
					detailed analysis of man’s mental faculties, he sought to set down the exact
					limits of what is knowable.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Let us then suppose the mind to be white paper, void of all characters,

				schools&mdash;that of the rationalists (including René Descartes, Benedictus Spinoza, and
				Immanuel Kant) and that of the empiricists (including John Locke, George Berkeley,
				and David Hume). In fact, the various philosophers did not easily fall into two
				clear groups, each being like and unlike each of the others in complex and
				overlapping ways. The essential difference between the two schools, however, was
				epistemological&mdash;that is, they differed in their opinions about what we can know, and
				how we know what we know. Put simply, the empiricists held that knowledge is derived
				from experience, while the rationalists claimed that knowledge can be gained through
				rational reflection alone.</p><p class="calibre13">Leibniz was a rationalist, and his distinction between truths of reasoning and
				truths of fact marks an interesting twist in the debate between rationalism and
				empiricism. His claim, which he makes in most famous work, the <i class="calibre12">Monadology</i>, is that in principle all knowledge can be
				accessed by rational reflection. However, due to shortcomings in our rational
				faculties, human beings must also rely on experience as a means of acquiring
				knowledge.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-467"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000124.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"We know hardly anything adequately, few things <i class="calibre12">a

					of his metaphysics&mdash;his view of how the universe is constructed. He holds that
					every part of the world, every individual thing, has a distinct concept or
					“notion” associated with it, and that every such notion contains within it
					everything that is true about itself, including its relations to other things.
					Because everything in the universe is connected, he argues, it follows that
					every notion is connected to every other notion, and so it is possible&mdash;at least
					in principle&mdash;to follow these connections and to discover truths about the entire
					universe through rational reflection alone. Such reflection leads to Leibniz’s
					“truths of reasoning.” However, the human mind can grasp only a small number of
					such truths (such as those of mathematics), and so it has to rely on experience,
					which yields “truths of fact.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;So how is it possible to progress from knowing that it is snowing, for
					example, to knowing what will happen tomorrow somewhere on the other side of the
					world? For Leibniz, the answer lies in the fact that the universe is composed of
					individual, simple substances called “monads.” Each monad is isolated from other
					monads, and each contains a complete representation of the whole universe in its
					past, present, and future states. This representation is synchronized between
					all the monads, so that each one has the same content. According to Leibniz,
					this is how God created things&mdash;in a state of “pre-established harmony.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leibniz claims that every human mind is a monad, and so contains a complete
					representation of the universe. It is therefore possible in principle for us to
					learn everything that there is to know about our world and beyond simply by
					exploring our own minds. Simply by analyzing my notion of the star Betelgeuse,
					for example, I will eventually be able to determine the temperature on the
					surface of the actual star Betelgeuse. However, in practice, the analysis that
					is required for me reach this information is impossibly complex&mdash;Leibniz calls it
					“infinite”&mdash;and because I cannot complete it, the only way that I can discover
					the temperature of Betelgeuse is by measuring it empirically using astronomical
					equipment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the temperature of the surface of Betelgeuse a truth of reasoning or a
					truth of fact? It may be true that I had to resort to empirical methods to
					discover the answer, but had my rational faculties been better I could also have
					discovered it through rational reflection. Whether it is a truth of reasoning or
					a truth of fact, therefore, seems to depend on how I arrive at the answer&mdash;but is
					this what Leibniz is claiming?</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"Each singular substance expresses the whole universe in its own
						way."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-470" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Necessary truths</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The trouble for Leibniz is that he holds that truths of reasoning are
					“necessary”, meaning that it is impossible to contradict them, while truths of
					fact are “contingent”; they can be denied without logical contradiction. A
					mathematical truth is a necessary truth, because denying its conclusions
					contradicts the meanings of its own terms. But the proposition “it is raining in
					Spain” is contingent, because denying it does not involve a contradiction in
					terms&mdash;although it may still be factually incorrect.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leibniz’s distinction between truths of reasoning and truths of fact is not
					simply an epistemological one (about the limits of knowledge), but also a
					metaphysical one (about the nature of the world), and it is not clear that his
					arguments support his metaphysical claim. Leibniz’s theory of monads seems to
					suggest that all truths are truths of reasoning, which we would have access to
					if we could finish our rational analysis. But as a truth of reasoning is a
					necessary truth, in what way is it impossible for the temperature on Betelgeuse
					to be 2,401 Kelvin rather than 2,400 Kelvin? Certainly not impossible in the
					sense that the proposition 2 + 2 = 5 is impossible, for the latter is simply a
					logical contradiction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if we follow Leibniz and separate neccesary and contingent truths,
					we end up with the following problem: I can discover Pythagoras’s theorem simply
					by reflecting on the idea of triangles, so Pythagoras’s theorem must be a truth
					of reasoning. But Betelgeuse’s temperature and Pythagoras’s theorem are both
					just as true, and just as much part of the monad that is my mind&mdash;so why should
					one be considered contingent and the other necessary?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Leibniz tells us that whereas no-one can reach the end of an
					infinite analysis, God can grasp the whole universe at once, and so for him all
					truths are neccessary truths. The difference between a truth of reasoning and a
					truth of fact, therefore, does seem to be a matter of how one comes to know
					it&mdash;and in that case it is difficult to see why the former should always be seen
					to be necessarily true, while the latter may or may not be true.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"God understands everything through eternal truth, since he does not need

					universe, Leibniz inevitably faces the problem of accounting for the notion of
					freedom of will. How can I choose to act in a certain way if God already knows
					how I am going to act? But the problem runs deeper&mdash;there seems to be no room for
					genuine contingency at all. Leibniz’s theory only allows for a distinction
					between truths whose necessity we can discover, and truths whose necessity only
					God can see. We know (if we accept Leibniz’s theory) that the future of the
					world is set by an omniscient and benevolent god, who therefore has created the
					best of all possible worlds. But we call the future contingent, or undetermined,
					because as limited human beings we cannot see its content.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-472"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000028.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The mechanical calculator</span> was one of

					distinction between “analytic” and “synthetic” statements&mdash;a division that has
					remained central to European philosophy ever since.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Liebniz’s theory of monads fared less well, and was criticized for its
					metaphysical extravagance. In the 20th century, however, the idea was
					rediscovered by scientists who were intrigued by Leibniz’s description of space
					and time as a system of relationships, rather than the absolutes of traditional

							idealism.</p></div><p class="intro">Like John Locke before him, George Berkeley was an empiricist,
				meaning that he saw experience as the primary source of knowledge. This view, which
				can be traced back to Aristotle, stands in contrast to the rationalist view that, in
				principle, all knowledge can be gained through rational reflection alone. Berkeley
				shared the same assumptions as Locke, but reached very different conclusions.
				According to Berkeley, Locke’s empiricism was moderate; it still allowed for the
				existence of a world independent of the senses, and followed René Descartes in
				seeing humans as being made up of two distinct substances, namely mind and
				body.</p><p class="calibre13">Berkeley’s empiricism, on the other hand, was far more extreme, and led him to a
				position known as “immaterialist idealism.” This means that he was a monist,
				believing that there is only one kind of substance in the universe, and an idealist,
				believing that this single substance is mind, or thought, rather than matter.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley’s position is often summarized by the Latin phrase <i class="calibre12">esseest percipi</i> (“to be is to be perceived”), but it is
				perhaps better represented by <i class="calibre12">esse est aut perciperi aut
					percipi</i> (“to be is to perceive or to be perceived”). For according to
				Berkeley, the world consists only of perceiving minds and their ideas. This is not
				to say that he denies the existence of the external world, or claims that it is in
				any way different from what we perceive. His claim is rather that all knowledge must
				come from experience, and that all we ever have access to are our perceptions. And
				since these perceptions are simply “ideas” (or mental representations), we have no
				grounds for believing that anything exists other than ideas and the perceivers of
				ideas.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-478"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000333.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"There is no such thing as what philosophers call material substance."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">George Berkeley</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-479" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Causation and volition</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Berkeley’s target was Descartes’ view of the world as elaborated by Locke and
					the scientist Robert Boyle. In this view, the physical world is made up of a
					vast number of physical particles, or “corpuscles”, whose nature and
					interactions give rise to the world as we understand it. More controversially,
					for Berkeley, this view also maintains that the world causes the perceptual
					ideas we have of it by the way it interacts with our senses.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley has two main objections to this view. First, he argues that our
					understanding of causality (the fact that certain events cause other events) is
					based entirely on our experience of our own volitions (the way we cause events
					to happen through the action of our wills). His point is not simply that it is
					wrong for us to project our own experience of volitional action onto the
					world&mdash;which we do when we say that the world causes us to have ideas about the
					world. His point is that there is in fact no such thing as a “physical cause”,
					because there is no such thing as a physical world beyond the world of ideas
					that could possibly be the cause of our ideas. The only type of cause that there
					is in the world, according to Berkeley, is precisely the volitional kind of
					cause that is the exercise of the will.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley’s second objection is that because ideas are mental entities, they
					cannot resemble physical entities, because the two types of thing have
					completely different properties. A painting or a photograph can resemble a
					physical object because it is itself a physical thing, but to think of an idea
					as resembling a physical object is to mistake it for a physical thing itself.
					Ideas, then, can only resemble other ideas. And as our only experience of the
					world comes through our ideas, any claim that we can even understand the notion
					of “physical things” is mistaken. What we are really understanding are mental
					things. The world is constructed purely of thought, and whatever is not itself
					perceiving, exists only as one of our perceptions.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"If there were external bodies, it is impossible we should ever come to
						know it."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">George Berkeley</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-480" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The cause of perception</h2></div><p class="calibre14">If things that are not perceivers only exist in so far as they are perceived,
					however, this seems to mean that when I leave the room, my desk, computer,
					books, and so on all cease to exist, for they are no longer being perceived.
					Berkeley’s response to this is that nothing is ever unperceived, for when I am
					not in my room, it is still perceived by God. His theory, therefore, not only
					depends on the existence of God, but of a particular type of God&mdash;one who is
					constantly involved in the world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Berkeley, God’s involvement in the world runs deeper than this. As we have
					seen, he claims that there are no physical causes, but only “volitions”, or acts
					of will, and it follows that only an act of will can produce the ideas that we
					have about the world. However, I am not in control of my experience of the
					world, and cannot choose what I experience&mdash;the world simply presents itself to
					me the way it does, whether I like it or not. Therefore, the volitions that
					cause my ideas about the world are not mine; they are God’s. So for Berkeley,
					God not only creates us as perceivers, he is the cause and constant generator of
					all our perceptions. This raises a number of questions, the most urgent being:
					how is it that we sometimes perceive things incorrectly? Why would God want to
					deceive us?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley tries to answer this question by claiming that our perceptions are
					never, in fact, in error, and that where we go wrong is in the judgements we
					make about what we perceive. For example, if an oar half-submerged in water
					looks bent to me, then it really is bent&mdash;where I go wrong is thinking that it
					only appears to be bent.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what happens if I reach into the water and feel the oar? It certainly
					feels straight. And since the oar cannot be both straight and bent at the same
					time, there must in fact be two oars&mdash;one that I see and one that I feel. Even
					more problematic for Berkeley, however, is the fact that two different people
					seeing the same oar must in fact be seeing two different oars, for there is no
					single, “real” oar “out there” that their perceptions converge on.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"An idea can be like nothing but an idea; a color or figure can be like

					perceive the same things. Each of us is locked in his own world, cut off from
					the worlds of other people. The fact that God has an idea of an oar cannot help
					us here, for that is a third idea, and therefore a third oar. God caused my idea
					and your idea, but unless we share a single mind with each other and with God,
					there are still three different ideas, so there are three different oars. This
					leads us to the problem of solipsism&mdash;the possibility that the only thing I can
					be certain of existing&mdash;or that may in fact exist&mdash;is myself.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible solution to solipsism runs as follows: since I can cause changes
					in the world, such as raising my own hand, and since I notice similar changes in
					the bodies of other people, I can infer that those bodies are also changed by a
					“consciousness” inside them. The problem for Berkeley, though, is that there is
					no “real” hand being lifted&mdash;the most a person can do is be the cause of the idea
					of his own hand rising&mdash;and only their idea, not another person’s. I, in other
					words, must still rely on God to supply me with my idea of another person’s hand
					rising. Far from supplying us with empirical certainty, therefore, Berkeley
					leaves us depending for our knowledge of the world, and of the existence of
					other minds, upon our faith in a God that would never deceive us.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth&mdash;in a word, all those bodies

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-64"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">During the Renaissance, Europe had evolved into a collection of
				separate nation states, having previously been a continent unified under the control
				of the Church. As power devolved to separate countries, distinctive national
				cultures formed, which were most obvious in arts and literature, but could also be
				seen in the philosophical styles that emerged during the 17th century.</p><p class="calibre13">During the Age of Reason there was a very clear difference between the rationalism
				of continental Europe and the empiricism of British philosophers, and in the 18th
				century philosophy continued to center on France and Britain, as the Enlightenment
				period unfolded. Old values and feudal systems crumbled as the new nations founded
				on trade gave rise to a growing urban middle-class with unprecedented prosperity.
				The richest nations, such as Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands,
				established colonies and empires around the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-486"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000209.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-487" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">France and Britain</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Philosophy increasingly focused on social and political issues, also along
					national lines. In Britain, where a revolution had already come and gone,
					empiricism reached a peak in the works of David Hume, while the new
					utilitarianism dominated political philosophy. This evolved alongside the
					Industrial Revolution that had started in the 1730s, as thinkers such as John
					Stuart Mill refined the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and helped to establish
					both a liberal democracy and a framework for modern civil rights. The situation
					in France, however, was less stable. The rationalism of René Descartes gave way
					to a generation of <i class="calibre12">philosophes</i>, radical
					political philosophers who were to popularize the new scientific way of
					thinking. They included the literary satirist Voltaire and the encyclopedist
					Denis Diderot, but the most revolutionary was Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His vision
					of a society governed on the principles of <i class="calibre12">liberté</i>, <i class="calibre12">egalité</i><i class="calibre12">,</i> and <i class="calibre12">fraternité</i> (liberty, equality, and fraternity) provided the
					battle cry of the French Revolution in 1789, and has inspired radical thinkers
					ever since. Rousseau believed that civilization was a corrupting influence on
					people, who are instinctively good, and it was this part of his thinking set the
					tone for Romanticism, the movement that followed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Romantic period, European literature, painting, and music became
					preoccupied with an idealized view of nature, in marked contrast to the
					sophisticated urban elegance of the Enlightenment. Perhaps the key difference
					was the way in which the Romantics valued feeling and intuition above reason.
					The movement took hold throughout Europe, continuing until the end of the 19th
					century.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-488" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">German Idealism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">German philosophy came to dominate the 19th century, largely due to the work
					of Immanuel Kant. His idealist philosophy, which claimed that we can never know
					anything about things that exist beyond our selves, radically altered the course
					of philosophical thought. Although only a few years younger than Hume and
					Rousseau, Kant belonged to the next generation: his major philosophical works
					were written after their deaths, and his new explanation of the universe and our
					knowledge of it managed to integrate the approaches of rationalism and
					empiricism in a way more suited both to Romanticism and to Germanic
					culture.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant’s followers included Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, who together became
					known as the German Idealists, but also Schopenhauer, whose idiosyncratic
					interpretation of Kant’s philosophy incorporated ideas from Eastern
					philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the followers of Hegel’s rigid Idealism was Karl Marx, who brilliantly
					brought together German philosophical methods, French revolutionary political
					philosophy, and British economic theory. After writing the <i class="calibre12">Communist Manifesto</i> with Friedrich Engels, he wrote
						<i class="calibre12">Das Kapital</i>, arguably one of the most
					influential philosophical works of all time. Within decades of his death,
					countries across the world had set up revolutionary states on the principles
					that he had proposed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile in the US, which had overthrown British colonial rule and
					established a republic based on Enlightenment values, an American culture
					independent of its European roots began to develop. At first Romantic, by the
					end of the 19th century it had produced a homegrown strand of philosophy,
					pragmatism, which examines the nature of truth. This was in keeping with the
					country’s democratic roots and well suited to the culture of the new
					century.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				Enlightenment. This period was characterized by an intense questioning of the world
				and how people live in it. European philosophers and writers turned their attention
				to the acknowledged authorities&mdash;such as the Church and state&mdash;to question their
				validity and their ideas, while also searching for new perspectives. Until the 17th
				century, Europeans had largely accepted the Church’s explanations of what, why, and
				how things existed, but both scientists and philosophers had begun to demonstrate
				different approaches to establishing the truth. In 1690 the philosopher John Locke
				had argued that no ideas were innate (known at birth), and that all ideas arise from
				experience alone. His argument was given further weight by scientist Isaac Newton
				whose experiments provided new ways of discovering truths about the world. It was
				against this background of rebellion against the accepted traditions that Voltaire
				pronounced that certainty is absurd.</p><p class="calibre13">Voltaire refutes the idea of certainty in two ways. First, he points out that
				apart from a few necessary truths of mathematics and logic, nearly every fact and
				theory in history has been revised at some point in time. So what appears to be
				“fact” is actually little more than a working hypothesis. Second, he agrees with
				Locke that there is no such thing as an innate idea, and points out that ideas we
				seem to know as true from birth may be only cultural, as these change from country
				to country.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-491"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000158.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-492" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Revolutionary doubt</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Voltaire does not assert that there are no absolute truths, but he sees no
					means of reaching them. For this reason he thinks doubt is the only logical
					standpoint. Given that endless disagreement is therefore inevitable, Voltaire
					says that it is important to develop a system, such as science, to establish
					agreement.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In claiming that certainty is more pleasant than doubt, Voltaire hints at how
					much easier it is simply to accept authoritative statements&mdash;such as those issued
					by the monarchy or Church&mdash;than it is to challenge them and think for yourself.
					But Voltaire believes it is vitally important to doubt every “fact” and to
					challenge all authority. He holds that government should be limited but speech
					uncensored, and that science and education lead to material and moral progress.
					These were fundamental ideals of both the Enlightenment and the French
					Revolution, which took place 11 years after Voltaire’s death.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-493"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000132.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Scientific experiments</span> during the Age

					him in trouble: he was imprisoned several times for insulting nobility, and was
					once exiled from France. This led to a stay in England, where he fell under the
					influence of English philosophy and science. After returning to France he became
					wealthy through speculation, and was thereafter able to devote himself to
					writing. He had several long and scandalous affairs, and travelled widely
					throughout Europe. In later life Voltaire campaigned vigorously for legal reform

				version of empiricism, according to which the world only exists in so far as it is
				perceived. But it was Hume, the third of the major British empiricists, who dealt
				the biggest blow to rationalism in an argument presented in his <i class="calibre12">Treatise of Human Nature</i>.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-498"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000024.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-499" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hume’s fork</h2></div><p class="calibre14">With a remarkable clarity of language, Hume turns a sceptical eye to the
					problem of knowledge, and argues forcibly against the notion that we are born
					with “innate ideas” (a central tenet of rationalism). He does so by first
					dividing the contents of our minds into two kinds of phenomena, and then asking
					how these relate to each other. The two phenomena are “impressions”&mdash;or direct
					perceptions, which Hume calls the “sensations, passions, and emotions”&mdash;and
					“ideas”, which are faint copies of our impressions, such as thoughts,
					reflections, and imaginings. And it is while analyzing this distinction that
					Hume draws an unsettling conclusion&mdash;one that calls into question our most
					cherished beliefs, not only about logic and science, but about the nature of the
					world around us.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem, for Hume, is that very often we have ideas that cannot be
					supported by our impressions, and Hume concerns himself with finding the extent
					to which this is the case. To understand what he means, we need to note that for
					Hume there are only two kinds of statement&mdash;namely “demonstrative” and “probable”
					statements&mdash;and he claims that in everyday experience we somehow confuse the two
					types of knowledge that these express.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonstrative statement is one whose truth or falsity is self-evident. Take,
					for example, the statement 2 + 2 = 4. Denying this statement involves a logical
					contradiction&mdash;in other words, to claim that 2 + 2 does not equal 4 is to fail to
					grasp the meanings of the terms “2” or “4” (or “+” or “=”). Demonstrative
					statements in logic, mathematics, and deductive reasoning are known to be true
					or false <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>, meaning “prior to
					experience.” The truth of a probable statement, however, is not self-evident,
					for it is concerned with matters of empirical fact. For example, any statement
					about the world such as “Jim is upstairs”, is a probable statement because it
					requires empirical evidence for it to be known to be true or false. In other
					words, its truth or falsity can only be known through some kind of
					experiment&mdash;such as by going upstairs to see if Jim is there.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this, we can ask of any statement whether it is probable or
					demonstrative. If it is neither of these, then we cannot know it to be true or
					false, and so, for Hume, it is a meaningless statement. This division of all
					statements into two possible kinds, as if forming the horns of a dilemma, is
					often referred to as “Hume’s fork.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"In our reasonings concerning fact, there are all imaginable degrees of

							the same as it is today.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-502" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Inductive reasoning</h2></div><p class="calibre14">There are no surprises in Hume’s reasoning so far, but things take a strange
					turn when he applies this line of argument to inductive inference&mdash;our ability to
					infer things from past evidence. We observe an unchanging pattern, and infer
					that it will continue in the future, tacitly assuming that nature will continue
					to behave in a uniform way. For example, we see the sun rise every morning, and
					infer that it will rise again tomorrow. But is our claim that nature follows
					this uniform pattern really justifiable? Claiming that the sun will rise
					tomorrow is not a demonstrative statement, as claiming the opposite involves no
					logical contradiction. Nor is it a probable statement, as we cannot experience
					the sun’s future risings.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The same problem occurs if we apply Hume’s fork to the evidence for causality.
					The statement “event A causes event B” seems on the face of it to be one that we
					can verify, but again, this does not stand up to scrutiny. There is no logical
					contradiction involved in denying that A causes B (as there would be in denying
					that 2 + 2 = 4), so it cannot be a demonstrative statement. Nor can it be proved
					empirically, since we cannot observe every event A to see if it is followed by
					B, so it is not a probable statement either. The fact that, in our limited
					experience, B invariably follows A is no rational ground for believing that A
					will always be followed by B, or that A causes B.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is never any rational basis for inferring cause and effect, then what
					justification do we have for making that connection? Hume explains this simply
					as “human nature”&mdash;a mental habit that reads uniformity into regular repetition,
					and a causal connection into what he calls the “constant conjunction” of events.
					Indeed, it is this kind of inductive reasoning that is the basis of science, and
					tempts us to interpret our inferences as “laws” of nature&mdash;but despite what we
					may think, this practice cannot be justified by rational argument.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying this, Hume makes his strongest case against rationalism, for he is
					saying that it is belief (which he defines as “a lively idea related to or
					associated with a present impression”), guided by custom, that lies at the heart
					of our claims to knowledge rather than reason.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Nature, by an absolute and uncontrollable necessity, has determined us to
						judge as well as to breathe and feel."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">David Hume</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-503" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Custom as our guide</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Hume goes on to acknowledge that although inductive inferences are not
					provable, this does not mean that they are not useful. After all, we still have
					a reasonable claim to expect something to happen, judging from past observation
					and experience. In the absence of a rational justification for inductive
					inference, custom is a good guide.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hume adds, however, that this “mental habit” should be applied with caution.
					Before inferring cause and effect between two events, we should have evidence
					both that this succession of events has been invariable in the past, and that
					there is a necessary connection between them. We can reasonably predict that
					when we let go of an object it will fall to the ground, because this is what has
					always happened in the past, and there is an obvious connection between letting
					go of the object and its falling. On the other hand, two clocks set a few
					seconds apart will chime one after another&mdash;but since there is no obvious
					connection between them, we should not infer that one clock’s chiming is the
					cause of the other’s.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hume’s treatment of the “problem of induction”, as this became known, both
					undermines the claims of rationalism and elevates the role of belief and custom
					in our lives. As he says, the conclusions drawn by our beliefs are “as
					satisfactory to the mind… as the demonstrative kind.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-504"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000253.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Science supplies us</span> with ever more

					better known in his own country for being the author of a <i class="calibre12">History of Great Britain</i> than for his philosophy;
					in Germany, however, the significance of his epistemology had more impact.
					Immanuel Kant admitted to being woken from his “dogmatic slumbers” by reading
					Hume, who remained a significant influence on German philosophers of the 19th
					century and the logical positivists of the 20th century, who believed that only
					meaningful statements could be verifiable. Hume’s account of the problem of
					induction remained unchallenged throughout this period, and resurfaced in the

				period known as the Enlightenment, and an embodiment of the continental European
				philosophy of the time. As a young man he tried to make his name as both a musician
				and composer, but in 1740 he met Denis Diderot and Jean d’Alembert, the philosopher
				compilers of the new <i class="calibre12">Encyclopédie</i>, and became
				interested in philosophy. The political mood in France at this time was uneasy.
				Enlightenment thinkers in France and England had begun to question the status quo,
				undermining the authority of both the Church and the aristocracy, and advocates of
				social reform such as Voltaire continually fell foul of the overbearing censorship
				of the establishment. Unsurprisingly in this context, Rousseau’s main area of
				interest became political philosophy. His thinking was influenced not only by his
				French contemporaries, but also by the work of English philosophers&mdash;and in
				particular the idea of a social contract as proposed by Thomas Hobbes and refined by
				John Locke.</p><p class="calibre13">Like them, Rousseau compared an idea of humanity in a hypothetical “natural state”
				with how people actually live in a civil society. But he took such a radically
				different view of this natural state and the way it is affected by society, that it
				could be considered a form of “counter-Enlightenment” thinking. It held within it
				the seeds of the next great movement, Romanticism.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-510"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000314.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-511" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Science and art corrupt</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Hobbes had envisaged life in the natural state as “solitary, poor, nasty,
					brutish, and short.” In his view humanity is instinctively self-interested and
					self-serving, and that civilization is necessary to place restrictions on these
					instincts. Rousseau, however, looks more kindly on human nature, and sees civil
					society as a much less benevolent force.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that society might be a harmful influence first occurred to Rousseau
					when he wrote an essay for a competition organized by the Academy of Dijon,
					answering the question: “Has the restoration of the sciences and the arts
					contributed to refining moral practices?” The expected answer from thinkers of
					the time, and especially from a musician such as Rousseau, was an enthusiastic
					affirmative, but in fact Rousseau argued the opposite case. His <i class="calibre12">Discourse on the Sciences and Arts</i>, which won him
					first prize, controversially puts forward the idea that the arts and sciences
					corrupt and erode morals. He argues that far from improving minds and lives, the
					arts and sciences decrease human virtue and happiness.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-512"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000292.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Romantic movement</span> in art and

					acclaimed essay, Rousseau took the idea a stage further in a second essay, the
						<i class="calibre12">Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of
						Inequality among Men</i>. The subject matter chimed with the mood of
					the time, echoing the calls for social reform from writers such as Voltaire, but
					once again Rousseau contradicted conventional thinking with his analysis. The
					selfish, savage, and unjust state of nature depicted by Hobbes is, for Rousseau,
					a description not of “natural man”, but of “civilized man.” In fact he claims
					that it is civil society that induces this savage state. Humanity’s natural
					state, he argues, is innocent, happy, and independent: man is born free.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-514" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Society corrupts</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The state of nature that Rousseau describes is a pastoral idyll, where people
					in their natural state are fundamentally good. (The English wrongly interpreted
					Rousseau’s idea of natural man as a “noble savage”, but this was due to a
					mistranslation of the French <i class="calibre12">sauvage</i>, which
					means simply “natural”, not brutish.) People are endowed with innate virtue and,
					more importantly, the attributes of compassion and empathy. But once this state
					of innocence is disrupted, and the power of reason begins to separate humankind
					from the rest of nature, people become detached from their natural virtues. The
					imposition of civil society on the state of nature therefore entails a move away
					from virtue toward vice, and from idyllic happiness toward misery.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousseau sees the fall from a state of nature and the establishment of civil
					society as regrettable but inevitable, because it resulted from the human
					capacity for reason. The process began, he thought, the first time that a man
					enclosed a piece of land for himself, so introducing the notion of property. As
					groups of people began to live side by side like this, they formed societies,
					which could only be maintained though a system of laws. But Rousseau claims that
					every society loses touch with humanity’s natural virtues, including empathy,
					and so imposes laws that are not just, but selfish. They are designed to protect
					property, and they are inflicted on the poor by the rich. The move from a
					natural to a civilized state therefore brought about a move not only from virtue
					to vice, Rousseau points out, but also from innocence and freedom to injustice
					and enslavement. Although humanity is naturally virtuous, it is corrupted by
					society; and although man is born free, the laws imposed by society condemn him
					to a life “in chains.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-515"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000264.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Adam and Eve</span> represent the kind of

					more feathers than his first, but it gained him a reputation and quite a
					following. His portrayal of the state of nature as desirable and not brutal
					formed a vital part of the emerging Romantic movement in literature. Rousseau’s
					rallying cry of “back to nature!” and his pessimistic analysis of modern society
					as full of inequalities and injustices sat well with the growing social unrest
					of the 1750s, especially in France. Not content with merely stating the problem,
					Rousseau went on to offer a solution, in what is seen as perhaps his most
					influential work, <i class="calibre12">The Social Contract</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousseau opens his book with the challenging declaration “Man is born free,
					yet everywhere he is in chains”, which was considered such a call for radical
					change that it was adopted as a slogan during the French Revolution 27 years
					later. Having issued his challenge, Rousseau then sets out his vision of an
					alternative civil society, run not by aristocrats, the monarchy, and the Church,
					but by all citizens, who participate in the business of legislation. Modelled on
					Classical republican ideas of democracy, Rousseau imagines the citizen body
					operating as a unit, prescribing laws according to the <i class="calibre12">volonté générale</i>, or general will. The laws would arise from all
					and apply to all&mdash;everyone would be considered equal. In contrast with the social
					contract envisaged by Locke, which was designed to protect the rights and
					property of individuals, Rousseau advocates giving legislative power to the
					people as a whole, for the benefit of all, administered by the general will. He
					believes that the freedom to take part in the legislative process would lead to
					an elimination of inequality and injustice, and that it would promote a feeling
					of belonging to society&mdash;that it would inevitably lead to the <i class="calibre12">liberté, égalité, fraternité</i> (liberty, equality,
					fraternity) that became the motto of the new French Republic.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"Tranquility is found also in dungeons; but is that enough to make them

					Rousseau expanded on his theme, explaining that education was responsible for
					corrupting the state of nature and perpetuating the evils of modern society. In
					other books and essays he concentrated on the adverse effects of both
					conventional religion and atheism. At the center of all his works lay the idea
					that reason threatens human innocence and, in turn, freedom and happiness.
					Instead of the education of the intellect, he proposes an education of the
					senses, and he suggests that our religious faith should be guided by the heart,
					not the head.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"The general will should come from all to apply to all."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-518" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Political influence</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Most of Rousseau’s writings were immediately banned in France, gaining him
					both notoriety and a large following. By the time of his death in 1778,
					revolution in France and elsewhere was imminent, and his idea of a social
					contract in which the general will of the citizen body controlled the
					legislative process offered the revolutionaries a viable alternative to the
					corrupt system as it stood. But his philosophy was at odds with contemporary
					thinking, and his insistence that a state of nature was superior to civilization
					led him to fall out with fellow reformers such as Voltaire and Hume. Rousseau’s
					political influence was felt most strongly during the period of revolution
					immediately after his death, but his influence on philosophy, and political
					philosophy in particular, emerged to a greater extent in the 19th century. Georg
					Hegel integrated Rousseau’s ideas of social contract into his own philosophical
					system. Later and more importantly, Karl Marx was particularly struck by some of
					Rousseau’s work on inequality and injustice. Unlike Robespierre, one of the
					leaders of the French Revolution, who had appropriated Rousseau’s philosophy for
					his own ends during the Reign of Terror, Marx fully understood and developed
					Rousseau’s analysis of capitalist society and the revolutionary means of
					replacing it. Marx’s <i class="calibre12">Communist Manifesto</i> ends
					with a nod to Rousseau, encouraging the proletarians (workers) have “nothing to
					lose but their chains.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-519"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000235.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The French Revolution</span>, which began 11

				economist the world has ever known. The concepts of bargaining and self-interest
				that he explored, and the possibility of different types of agreements and
				interests&mdash;such as “the common interest”&mdash;are of recurring appeal
				to philosophers. His writings are also important because they give a more general
				and abstract form to the idea of the “commercial” society that was developed by his
				friend David Hume.</p><p class="calibre13">Like his Swiss contemporary, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Smith assumes that the motives
				of human beings are partly benevolent and partly self-interested, but that
				self-interest is the stronger trait and so is a better guide to human behavior. He
				believes that this can be confirmed by social observation, and so, broadly speaking,
				his approach is an empirical one. In one of his most famous discussions of the
				psychology of bargaining, he contends that the most frequent opening gambit in a
				bargain is for one party to urge the other&mdash;“the best way for you to
				get what <i class="calibre12">you</i> want is for you to give me what
					<i class="calibre12">I</i> want.” In other words, “we address
				ourselves, not to [another’s] humanity, but to their self-love.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith goes on to claim that the exchange of useful objects is a distinctively
				human characteristic. He notes that dogs are never observed exchanging bones, and
				that should an animal wish to obtain something, the only way it can do so is to
				“gain the favor of those whose service it requires.” Humans may also depend on this
				sort of “fawning or servile attention”, but they cannot resort to it whenever they
				need help, because life requires “the cooperation and assistance of great
				multitudes.” For example, to stay comfortably at an inn for a night we
				require the input of many people&mdash;to cook and serve the food, to prepare the
				room and so on&mdash;none of whose services can be depended on through good will
				alone. For this reason, “man is an animal that makes bargains”&mdash;and the
				bargain is struck by proposing a deal that appears to be in the self-interest of
				both parties.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-524"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000165.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-525" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The division of labor</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In his account of the emergence of market economies, Smith argues that our
					ability to make bargains put an end to the once universal requirement that every
					person, or at least every family, be economically self-sufficient. Thanks to
					bargaining, it became possible for us to concentrate on producing fewer and
					fewer goods, and ultimately to produce just a single good, or offer a single
					service, and to exchange this for everything else we required. This process was
					revolutionized by the invention of money, which abolished the need to barter.
					From then on, in Smith’s view, only those who were unable to work had to depend
					on charity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else could come to the marketplace to exchange their labor&mdash;or
					the money they earned through labor&mdash;for the products of other people’s
					labor.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This elimination of the need to provide everything for ourselves led to the
					emergence of people with particular sets of skills (such as the baker and the
					carpenter), and then to what Smith calls a “division of labor” among
					workers. This is Smith’s phrase for specialization, whereby an individual not
					only pursues a single type of work, but performs only a single task in a job
					that is shared by several people. Smith illustrates the importance of
					specialization at the beginning of his masterpiece, <i class="calibre12">The
						Wealth of Nations</i>, by showing how the making of a humble metal
					pin is radically improved by adopting the factory system. Where one man working
					alone would find it hard to produce 20 perfect pins in a day, a group of 10 men,
					charged with different tasks&mdash;from drawing out the wire, straightening it,
					cutting it, pointing it, and grinding it, to joining it to a pinhead&mdash;were
					able, in Smith’s time, to produce over 48,000 pins a day.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith was impressed by the great improvements in the productivity of labor
					that took place during the Industrial Revolution&mdash;improvements that saw
					workers provided with much better equipment, and often saw machines replacing
					workers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The jack-of-all-trades could not survive in such a system, and even
					philosophers began to specialize in the various branches of their subject, such
					as logic, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-526"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000138.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The market is the key</span> to establishing

					everyone to be eligible for some kind of work (since it frees us from training
					in a craft), Smith argues that it can lead to universal wealth in a well-ordered
					society. Indeed, he says that in conditions of perfect liberty, the market can
					lead to a state of perfect equality&mdash;one in which everyone is free to
					pursue his own interests in his own way, so long as it accords with the laws of
					justice. And by equality Smith is not referring to equality of opportunity, but
					to equality of condition. In other words, his goal is the creation of a society
					not divided by competitiveness, but drawn together by bargaining based on mutual
					self-interest.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith’s point, therefore, is not that people should have freedom just because
					they deserve it. His point is that society as a whole benefits from individuals
					pursuing their own interests. For the “invisible hand” of the market, with its
					laws of supply and demand, regulates the amount of goods that are available, and
					prices them far more efficiently than any government could. Put simply, the
					pursuit of self-interest, far from being incompatible with an equitable society,
					is, in Smith’s view, the only way of guaranteeing it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a society, a government can limit itself to performing just a few
					essential functions, such as providing defense, criminal justice, and education,
					and taxes and duties can be reduced accordingly. And just as bargaining can
					flourish within national boundaries, so it can flourish across them, leading to
					international trade&mdash;a phenomenon that was spreading across the world in
					Smith’s time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith recognized that there were problems with the notion of a free
					market&mdash;in particular with the increasingly common bargain of wages for
					working time. He also acknowledged that while the division of labor had huge
					economic benefits, repetitive work is not only boring for the worker, it can
					destroy a human being&mdash;and for this reason he proposed that governments
					should restrict the extent to which the production line is used. Nevertheless,
					when <i class="calibre12">The Wealth of Nations</i> was first
					published, its doctrine of free and unregulated trade was seen as revolutionary,
					not only because of its attack on established commercial and agricultural
					privileges and monopolies, but also because of its argument that a nation’s
					wealth depends not on its gold reserves, but on its labor&mdash;a view that
					went against all economic thinking in Europe at the time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith’s reputation for being a revolutionary was bolstered during the long
					debate about the nature of society that followed the French Revolution of 1789,
					prompting the mid-Victorian historian H.T. Buckle to describe <i class="calibre12">The Wealth of Nations</i> as “probably the most
					important book that has ever been written.”</p></div><div id="calibre_link-528" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Smith’s legacy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Critics have argued that Smith was wrong to assume that the “general interest”
					and “consumer interest” are the same, and that the free market is beneficial to
					all. What is true is that even though Smith was sympathetic toward the victims
					of poverty, he never fully succeeded in balancing the interests of producers and
					consumers within his social model, or integrating into it the domestic labor,
					performed mainly by women, that helped to keep society running
					efficiently.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and with the rise of socialism in the 19th century, Smith’s
					reputation declined, but renewed interest in free market economics in the late
					20th century saw a revival of Smith’s ideas. Indeed, only today can we fully
					appreciate his most visionary claim&mdash;that a market is more than just a
					place. A market is a concept, and as such can exist anywhere&mdash;not only in
					a designated place such as a town square. This foreshadows the kind of “virtual”
					marketplace that only became possible with the advent of telecommunications
					technology. Today’s financial markets and online trading bear witness to Smith’s
					great vision.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"Civilized society stands at all times in need of the cooperation and

				years of philosophical thought, nobody had been able to produce an argument to prove
				that there really is a world out there, external to us. He particularly had in mind
				the theories of René Descartes and George Berkeley, who both entertained doubts
				about the existence of an external world.</p><p class="calibre13">At the start of his <i class="calibre12">Meditations</i>, Descartes
				argued that we must doubt all knowledge except that of our own existence as thinking
				beings&mdash;even the knowledge that there is an external world. He then went on to
				counter this sceptical point of view with an argument that claims to prove the
				existence of God, and therefore the reality of an outside world. However, many
				philosophers (including Kant) have not found Descartes’ proof of God to be valid in
				its reasoning.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley, on the other hand, argued that knowledge is indeed possible&mdash;but
				that it comes from experiences our consciousness perceives. We have no justification
				for believing that these experiences have any external existence outside our own
				minds.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-534"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000007.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-535" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Time and consciousness</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Kant wants to demonstrate that there is an external, material world, and that
					its existence cannot be doubted. His argument begins as follows: in order for
					something to exist, it must be determinable in time&mdash;that is, we must be
					able to say when it exists and for how long. But how does this work in the case
					of my own consciousness?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although consciousness seems to be constantly changing with a continuous flow
					of sensations and thoughts, we can use the word “now” to refer to what is
					currently happening in our consciousness. But “now” is not a determinate time or
					date. Every time I say “now”, consciousness is different.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies the problem: what makes it possible to specify the “when” of my own
					existence? We cannot experience time itself, directly; rather, we experience
					time through things that move, change, or stay the same. Consider the hands of a
					clock, constantly moving slowly around. The moving hands are useless for
					determining time on their own&mdash;they need something against which they
					change, such as the numbers on a clock face. Every resource I have for measuring
					my constantly changing “now” is found in material objects outside me in space
					(including my own physical body). Saying that I exist requires a determinate
					point in time, and this, in turn, requires an actually existing outside world in
					which time takes place. My level of certainty about the existence of the
					external world is thus precisely the same as my level of certainty about the
					existence of consciousness, which Descartes believed was absolutely
					certain.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-536"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000035.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">According to Kant,</span> we can only

							indirectly.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-537" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The problem of science</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Kant also looked at how science understood the exterior world. He admired the
					awesome progress that the natural sciences had made over the previous two
					centuries, compared with the relative stagnation in the subject from ancient
					times until that point. Kant, along with other philosophers, wondered what was
					suddenly being done correctly in scientific research. The answer given by many
					thinkers of the period was empiricism. The empiricists, such as John Locke and
					David Hume, argued that there is no knowledge except that which comes to us
					through our experience of the world. They opposed the views of rationalist
					philosophers, such as Descartes or Gottfried Leibniz, who argued that the mind’s
					ability to reason and deal with concepts is more important for knowledge than
					experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The empiricists claimed that the recent success of science was due to
					scientists being much more careful in their observations of the world than they
					had been previously, and making fewer unjustified assumptions based on reason
					alone. Kant argues that although this is no doubt partly true, it could not be
					the whole answer, as it is simply false to say that there was no detailed and
					careful empirical observation in science before the 16th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue, Kant argues, is that a new scientific method arose that made
					empirical observations valuable. This method involves two elements. First, it
					asserts that concepts such as force or movement can be perfectly described by
					mathematics. Second, it tests its own conceptions of the world by asking
					specific questions about nature and observing the answers. For example, the
					experimental physicist Galileo Galilei wanted to test the hypothesis that two
					things of different weights will nevertheless fall through the air at the same
					rate. He designed an experiment to test this in such a way that the only
					possible explanation of the observed result would be the truth or falsity of the
					hypothesis.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant identifies the nature and importance of the scientific method. He
					believes that this method had put physics and other subjects on the “secure road
					of a science.” However, his investigations do not stop there. His next
					question is: “Why is our experience of the world such that the scientific method
					works?” In other words, why is our experience of the world always mathematical
					in nature, and how is it always possible for human reason to put questions to
					nature?</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"It is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Immanuel Kant</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-538" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Intuitions and concepts</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In his most famous work, <i class="calibre12">Critique of Pure
						Reason</i>, Kant argues that our experience of the world involves two
					elements. The first is what he calls “sensibility”&mdash;our
					ability to be directly acquainted with particular things in space and time, such
					as this book you are reading now. These direct acquaintances he calls
					“intuitions.” Second is what Kant calls the “understanding”, our
					ability to have and use concepts. For Kant, a concept is an indirect
					acquaintance with things as examples of a type of thing, such as the concept of
					“book” in general. Without concepts we would not know our intuition was of a
					book; without intuitions we would never know that there were books at
					all.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these elements has, in turn, two sides. In sensibility, there is my
					intuition of a particular thing in space and time (like the book) and my
					intuition of space and time as such (my acquaintance with what space and time
					are like in general). In understanding, there is my concept of some type of
					thing (books) and my concept of a “thing” as such (substance). A concept such as
					substance defines what it means to be a thing in general rather than defining
					some type of thing like a book. My intuition of a book and the concept of a book
					are empirical, for how could I know anything about books unless I had come
					across them in the world? But my intuition of space and time and the concept of
					substance are <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>, meaning that they are
					known before or independently of any experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A true empiricist would argue against Kant that all acquaintances come from
					experience&mdash;in other words, nothing is <i class="calibre12">a
						priori</i>. They might say that we learn what space is by observing
					things in space; and we learn what substance is from our observation that the
					features of things change without the underlying thing itself changing. For
					instance, though a tree’s leaves turn from green to brown, and eventually fall
					from the tree, it is still the same tree.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"Thoughts without content are empty; intuitions without concepts are blind…

In order to learn about things
					outside of me, I need to know that they are outside of me. But that shows that I
					could not learn about space in this way: how can I locate something outside of
					me without already knowing what “outside of me” means? Some knowledge of space
					has to be assumed before I can ever study space empirically. We must be familiar
					with space <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument has an extraordinary consequence. Because space itself is
						<i class="calibre12">a priori</i>, it does not belong to things in
					the world. But our experience of things in space is a feature of our
					sensibility. A thing-in-itself&mdash;Kant’s term for a thing that is
					considered separately from sensibility, and therefore exterior to our
					minds&mdash;may have nothing to do with space. Kant used similar arguments to
					prove the same thing of time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant then turns to proving the existence of <i class="calibre12">a
						priori</i> concepts, such as substance. He asks us first to
					distinguish between two types of alteration: variation and change. Variation
					concerns the properties that things have: for instance, a tree’s leaves may be
					green or brown. Change is what the tree does: the same tree changes its leaves
					from green to brown. To make this distinction is already to use the notion of
					substance: the tree (as substance) changes, but the leaves (as the properties of
					substance) vary. If we do not accept this distinction, then we cannot accept the
					validity of the concept of substance. We would be saying that any time there is
					alteration, something “pops” into or out of existence; the tree with green
					leaves is annihilated at the same time that the tree with brown leaves begins to
					exist from nothing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant needs to prove that such a view is impossible. The key to this is time
					determination. Time cannot be directly experienced (it is not a thing); rather,
					we experience time through things that alter or do not alter, as Kant has
					already shown. If we experienced time through the tree with green leaves and
					also experienced time through the tree with brown leaves without there being any
					connection between the two, then we would be experiencing two separate real
					times. Since this is absurd, Kant believes he has demonstrated that the concept
					of substance is absolutely essential before we can gain any experience of the
					world. And, since it is through that experience that we learn anything
					empirical, the concept of substance could not be empirical: it is rather
						<i class="calibre12">a priori</i>.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"Only from the human standpoint can we speak of space."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Immanuel Kant</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-542" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The limits of knowledge</h2></div><p class="calibre14">A philosophical position that asserts that some state or activity of the mind
					is prior to and more fundamental than things we experience is called idealism,
					and Kant calls his own position “transcendental idealism.” He insists
					that space, time, and certain concepts are features of the world we experience
					(what Kant called the phenomenal world) rather than features of the world itself
					considered separately from experience (what Kant called the noumenal
					world).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant’s claims about <i class="calibre12">a priori</i> knowledge have
					both positive and negative consequences. The positive consequence is that the
						<i class="calibre12">a priori</i> nature of space, time, and
					certain concepts is what makes our experience of the world possible and
					reliable. Space and time make our experience mathematical in nature; we can
					measure it against known values. <i class="calibre12">A priori</i>
					concepts such as substance make it possible to address questions about nature
					such as “Is that a substance?” and “What properties does it exhibit and
					according to what laws?” In other words, Kant’s transcendental idealism is what
					makes it possible for our experience to be considered useful to science.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;On the negative side, certain types of thinking call themselves science and
					even resemble science, but fail utterly. This is because they apply to
					things-in-themselves intuitions about space and time, or concepts such as
					substance&mdash;which according to Kant must be valid for experience, but have
					no validity with respect to things-in-themselves. Because they resemble science,
					these types of thinking are a constant temptation to us, and are a trap that
					many fall into without realizing it. For example, we might wish to claim that
					God is the cause of the world, but cause and effect is another of the <i class="calibre12">a priori</i> concepts, like substance, that Kant
					believes is entirely valid for our experienced world, but not for
					things-in-themselves. So the existence of God (considered, as it usually is, as
					a being independent of the experienced world) is not something that could be
					known. The negative consequence of Kant's philosophy, then, is to place quite
					severe restrictions on the limits of knowledge.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Transcendental idealism gives us a much more radical way of understanding the
					distinction between ourselves and the external world. What is external to me is
					interpreted as not just external to me in space, but external to space itself
					(and to time, and to all the <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>
					concepts that make my experience of the world possible). And there are two
					worlds: the “world” of experience, which includes both my thoughts and feelings,
					and also includes experience of material things such as my body, or books; and
					the “world” of things-in-themselves, which is precisely not experienced and so

				But the meaning of the word “society” is not entirely clear, and it has changed over
				time. During the 18th century, when the Irish philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke
				was writing, Europe was becoming increasingly commercialized, and the idea that
				society is a mutual agreement between its members&mdash;like a commercial
				company&mdash;was readily understood. However, this point of view also implies that
				it is only the material things in life that matter. Burke attempts to redress the
				balance by reminding us that human beings also enrich their lives through science,
				art, and virtue, and that while society is indeed a contract or partnership, it is
				not simply concerned with economics, or, as he puts it, “gross animal
				existence.” Society embodies the common good (our agreement on customs,
				norms, and values), but for Burke “society” means more than just the people living
				now&mdash;it also includes our ancestors and descendants. Moreover, because every
				political constitution is part of “the great primeval contract of eternal society”,
				God himself is society’s ultimate guarantor.</p><p class="calibre13">Burke’s view has the doctrine of original sin (the idea that we are born sinful)
				at its core, so he has little sympathy for anyone seeking to blame society for their
				conduct. Likewise, he dismisses the idea, proposed by John Locke, that we can be
				perfected by education&mdash;as though we are born innocent and merely need to be
				given the correct influences. For Burke, the fallibility of individual judgment is
				why we need tradition, to give us the moral bearings we need&mdash;an argument that
				echoes David Hume, who claimed that “custom is the great guide to human
				life.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-550"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000240.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-551" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Tradition and change</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Because society is an organic structure with roots stretching deep into the
					past, Burke believed its political organization should develop naturally over
					time. He opposed the idea of sweeping or abrupt political changes that cut
					through this natural process. For this reason he opposed the French Revolution
					of 1789, foreseeing its dangers long before the execution of the king and the
					year-long Reign of Terror. It also prompted him on several occasions to
					criticize Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose book, <i class="calibre12">The Social
						Contract</i>, argued that the contract between citizens and the state
					can be broken at any time, depending on the will of the people. Another regular
					target for Burke was the English philosopher and scientist Joseph Priestley, who
					applauded the French Revolution and pilloried the idea of original sin.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his scepticism about modern commercial society, Burke was a great
					defender of private property, and was optimistic about the free market. For this
					reason, he is often hailed as the “father of modern
					conservatism”&mdash;a philosophy that values both economic freedom and
					tradition. Today, even socialists would agree with Burke that private property
					is a fundamental social institution, but would disagree with him about its
					value. Likewise, ecologically-minded philosophers share his belief in the duties
					of one generation to the next, but with the new agenda of creating a
					“sustainable society.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-552"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000134.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Burke condemned</span> the French Revolution

				political decisions should be made with the aim of achieving the greatest happiness
				for the greatest number of people. Bentham believes that the moral worth of such
				decisions relates directly to their utility, or efficiency, in generating happiness
				or pleasure. In a society driven by this “utilitarian” approach, he claims that
				conflicts of interest between individuals can be settled by legislators, guided
				solely by the principle of creating the broadest possible spread of contentment. If
				everyone can be made happy, so much the better, but if a choice is necessary, it is
				always preferable to favor the many over the few.</p><p class="calibre13">One of the main benefits of his proposed system, Bentham states, is its

					calculated to produce the highest measure of pleasure.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bentham also insists that all sources of pleasure are of equal value, so that
					the happiness derived from a good meal or close friendship is equal to that
					derived from an activity that may require effort or education, such as engaging
					in philosophical debate or reading poetry. This means that Bentham assumes a
					fundamental human equality, with complete happiness being accessible to all,

				first half of the 19th century. His central idea was that all phenomena, from
				consciousness to political institutions, are aspects of a single Spirit (by which he
				means “mind” or “idea”) that over the course of time is
				reintegrating these aspects into itself. This process of reintegration is what Hegel
				calls the “dialectic”, and it is one that we (who are all aspects of Spirit)
				understand as “history.” Hegel is therefore a monist, for he believes
				that all things are aspects of a single thing, and an idealist, for he believes that
				reality is ultimately something that is not material (in this case Spirit). Hegel’s
				idea radically altered the philosophical landscape, and to fully grasp its
				implications we need to take a look at the background to his thought.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-568"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000401.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-569" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">History and consciousness</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Few philosophers would deny that human beings are, to a great extent,
					historical&mdash;that we inherit things from the past, change them, and then
					pass them on to future generations. Language, for example, is something that we
					learn and change as we use it, and the same is true of science&mdash;scientists
					start with a body of theory, and then go on either to confirm or to disconfirm
					it. The same is also true of social institutions, such as the family, the state,
					banks, churches, and so on&mdash;most of which are modified forms of earlier
					practices or institutions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings, therefore, never begin their existence from scratch, but always
					within some kind of context&mdash;a context that changes, sometimes radically
					within a single generation. Some things, however, do not immediately appear to
					be historical, or subject to change.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of such a thing is consciousness. We know for certain that what we
					are conscious of will change, but what it means to be conscious&mdash;what kind of a
					thing it is to be awake, to be aware, to be capable of thinking and making
					decisions&mdash;is something that we tend to believe has always been the same for
					everyone. Likewise, it seems plausible to claim that the structures of thought
					are not historical&mdash;that the kind of activity that thinking is, and what mental
					faculties it relies on (memory, perception, understanding, and so on), has
					always been the same for everyone throughout history. This was certainly what
					Hegel’s great idealist predecessor, Immanuel Kant, believed&mdash;and to understand
					Hegel, we need to know what he thought about Kant’s work.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-570"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000013.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Certain changes</span>, such those brought

					consciousness, are <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>&mdash;that is, they
					exist prior to (and so are not are not derived from) experience. This means that
					they are independent not only of what we are thinking about, or are conscious
					of, but are independent of any historical influence or development.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kant calls these structures of thought “categories”, and these include the
					concepts “cause”, “substance”, “existence”, and “reality.” For
					example, experience may give us knowledge about the outside world, but nothing
					within experience itself teaches us that the outside world actually contains,
					for example, causes and effects. For Kant, knowledge of the basic structure of
					the outside world is <i class="calibre12">a priori</i> knowledge. It
					is only possible because we are all born with categories that supply us with a
					framework for experience&mdash;part of which is the assumption that there is an
					external world. However, Kant continues, this <i class="calibre12">a
						priori</i> framework means that the world as it appears is dependent
					upon the nature of the human mind, and does not represent the world as it really
					is&mdash;in other words, the world as it is “in itself.” This “world as it is in
					itself” is what Kant calls the noumenal world, and he claims that it is
					unknowable. All that we can know, according to Kant, is the world as it appears
					to us through the framework of the categories&mdash;and this is what Kant calls the
					“phenomenal” world, or the world of our everyday experience.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"To comprehend what is is the task of philosophy, for what is, is

					philosophy, but that his accounts of the “world in itself” and the categories
					still betray uncritical assumptions. Hegel argues that Kant fails in at least
					two respects to be sufficiently thorough in his analysis. First of all, Hegel
					regards Kant’s notion of the “world in itself” as an empty abstraction that
					means nothing. For Hegel, what exists is whatever comes to be manifested in
					consciousness&mdash;for example, as something sensed or as something thought. Kant’s
					second failure, Hegel argues, is that he makes too many assumptions about the
					nature and origin of the categories.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegel’s task is to understand these categories without making any assumptions
					whatsoever, and the worst assumption that Hegel sees in Kant concerns the
					relationships of the categories to each other. Kant assumes that the categories
					are original and distinct, and that they are totally separate from each
					other&mdash;but for Hegel they are “dialectical”&mdash;meaning that they are always subject
					to change. Where Kant believes in an unchanging framework of experience, Hegel
					believes that the framework of experience itself is subject to change&mdash;as much,
					indeed, as the world that we experience. Consciousness, therefore, and not
					merely what we are conscious of, is part of an evolving process. This process is
					“dialectical”&mdash;a concept that has a very specific meaning in Hegel’s
					philosophical thought.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-574" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hegel’s dialectic</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The notion of dialectic is central to what Hegel calls his immanent (internal)
					account of the development of things. He declares that his account will
					guarantee four things. First, that no assumptions are made. Second, that only
					the broadest notions possible are employed, the better to avoid asserting
					anything without justification. Third, that it shows how a general notion gives
					rise to other, more specific, notions. Fourth, that this process happens
					entirely from “within” the notion itself. This fourth requirement reveals the
					core of Hegel’s logic&mdash;namely that every notion, or “thesis”, contains within
					itself a contradiction, or “antithesis”, which is only resolved by the emergence
					of a newer, richer notion, called a “synthesis”, from the original notion
					itself. One consequence of this immanent process is that when we become aware of
					the synthesis, we realize that what we saw as the earlier contradiction in the
					thesis was only an apparent contradiction, one that was caused by some
					limitation in our understanding of the original notion.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of this logical progression appears at the beginning of Hegel’s
						<i class="calibre12">Science of Logic</i>, where he introduces the
					most general and all-inclusive notion of “pure being”&mdash;meaning anything that in
					any sense could be said to be. He then shows that this concept contains a
					contradiction&mdash;namely, that it requires the opposite concept of “nothingness” or
					“not-being” for it to be fully understood. Hegel then shows that this
					contradiction is simply a conflict between two aspects of a single, higher
					concept in which they find resolution. In the case of “being” and “not-being”,
					the concept that resolves them is “becoming.” When we say that something
					“becomes”, we mean that it moves from a state of not-being to a state of
					being&mdash;so it turns out that the concept of “being” that we started off with was
					not really a single concept at all, but merely one aspect of the three-part
					notion of “becoming.” The vital point here is that the concept of “becoming” is
					not introduced from “outside”, as it were, to resolve the contradiction between
					“being” and “not-being.” On the contrary, Hegel’s analysis shows that “becoming”
					was always the meaning of “being” and “not-being”, and that all we had to do was
					analyze these concepts to see their underlying logic.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This resolution of a thesis (being) with its antithesis (not-being) in a
					synthesis (becoming) is just the beginning of the dialectical process, which
					goes on to repeat itself at a higher level. That is, any new synthesis turns
					out, on further analysis, to involve its own contradiction, and this in turn is
					overcome by a still richer or “higher” notion. All ideas, according to Hegel,
					are interconnected in this way, and the process of revealing those connections
					is what Hegel calls his “dialectical method.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying that the structures of thought are dialectical, therefore, Hegel
					means that they are not distinct and irreducible, as Kant maintained, but that
					they emerge from the broadest, emptiest notions by means of this movement of
					self-contradiction and resolution.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Each of the parts of philosophy is a philosophical whole, a circle rounded

					“development”, and “movement.” On the one hand, these terms reflect something
					important about this method of philosophy&mdash;that it starts without assumptions and
					from the least controversial point, and allows ever richer and truer concepts to
					reveal themselves through the process of dialectical unfolding. On the other
					hand, however, Hegel clearly argues that these developments are not simply
					interesting facts of logic, but are real developments that can be seen at work
					in history. For example, a man from ancient Greece and a man living in the
					modern world will obviously think about different things, but Hegel claims that
					their very ways of thinking are different, and represent different kinds of
					consciousness&mdash;or different stages in the historical development of thought and
					consciousness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegel’s first major work, <i class="calibre12">Phenomenology of
						Spirit</i>, gives an account of the dialectical development of these
					forms of consciousness. He starts with the types of consciousness that an
					individual human being might possess, and works up to collective forms of
					consciousness. He does so in such a way as to show that these types of
					consciousness are to be found externalized in particular historical periods or
					events&mdash;most famously, for example, in the American and French
					revolutions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Hegel even argues that at certain times in history, Spirit’s next
					revolutionary change may manifest itself as an individual (such as Napoleon
					Bonaparte) who, as an individual consciousness, is completely unaware of his or
					her role in the history of Spirit. And the progress that these individuals make
					is always characterized by the freeing of aspects of Spirit (in human form) from
					recurring states of oppression&mdash;of overcoming tyrannies that may themselves be
					the result of the overcoming of previous tyrannies.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary idea&mdash;that the nature of consciousness has changed through
					time, and changed in accordance with a pattern that is visible in history&mdash;means
					that there is nothing about human beings that is not historical in character.
					Moreover, this historical development of consciousness cannot simply have
					happened at random. Since it is a dialectical process, it must in some sense
					contain both a particular sense of direction and an end point. Hegel calls this
					end point “Absolute Spirit”&mdash;and by this he means a future stage of consciousness
					which no longer even belongs to individuals, but which instead belongs to
					reality as a whole.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in its development, knowledge is complete&mdash;as it must be,
					according to Hegel, since Spirit encompasses, through dialectical synthesis,
					both the knower and what is known. Furthermore, Spirit grasps this knowledge as
					nothing other than its own completed essence&mdash;the full assimilation of all forms
					of “otherness” that were always parts of itself, however unknowingly. In other
					words, Spirit does not simply come to encompass reality&mdash;it comes to be aware of
					itself as having always been nothing other than the movement toward this
					encompassing of reality. As Hegel writes in <i class="calibre12">The
						Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, “History is a conscious, self-mediating
					process&mdash;[it is] Spirit emptied out into time.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-577"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000327.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Napoleon Bonaparte</span>, according to Hegel,

					separately from human history? What does it mean to say that reality itself is
					historical? According to Hegel, what we ordinarily call “nature” or “the world”
					is also Spirit. “Nature is to be regarded as a system of stages,” he writes,
					“one arising necessarily from the other and being the proximate truth of the
					stage from which it results.” He goes on to claim that one of the stages of
					nature is the progression from that which is “only Life” (nature as a living
					whole) to that which has “existence as Spirit” (the whole of nature now revealed
					as always having been, when properly understood, Spirit).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of nature, a different dialectic begins, namely that of
					consciousness itself&mdash;of the forms that Absolute Spirit takes in its dialectical
					progression toward self-realization. Hegel’s account of this progression begins
					with consciousness first thinking of itself as an individual thing among other
					individuals, and occupying a separate space to that of matter or the natural
					world. Later stages of consciousness, however, are no longer those of
					individuals, but are those of social or political groups&mdash;and so the dialectic
					continues, refining itself until it reaches the stage of Absolute Spirit.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-579" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Spirit and mind</h2></div><p class="calibre14">At the time Hegel was writing, there was a dominant philosophical view that
					there are two kinds of entities in the world&mdash;things that exist in the physical
					world and thoughts about those things&mdash;these latter being something like pictures
					or images of the things. Hegel argues that all versions of this distinction are
					mistakes, and involve committing ourselves to the ridiculous scenario in which
					two things are both absolutely different (things and thoughts), but also somehow
					similar (because the thoughts are images of things).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegel argues that it only seems as though the objects of thought are different
					from thought itself. For Hegel, the illusion of difference and separation
					between these two apparent “worlds” is shown as such when both thought and
					nature are revealed as aspects of Spirit. This illusion is overcome in Absolute
					Spirit, when we see that there is only one reality&mdash;that of Spirit, which knows
					and reflects on itself, and is both thought and what is thought about.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Whole of Spirit”, or “Absolute Spirit”, is the end point of Hegel’s
					dialectic. However, the preceding stages are not left behind, as it were, but
					are revealed as insufficiently analyzed aspects of Spirit as a whole. Indeed,
					what we think of as an individual person is not a separate constituent of
					reality, but is an aspect of how Spirit develops&mdash;or how it “empties itself out
					into time.” Thus, Hegel writes, “The True is the Whole. But the Whole is nothing
					other than the essence consummating itself through its development.” Reality is
					Spirit&mdash;both thought and what is known by thought&mdash;and undergoes a process of
					historical development.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Of the Absolute it must be said that it is essentially a result, that only

				idealist Georg Hegel for his dry writing style and optimistic philosophy.</p><p class="calibre13">Using Kant’s metaphysics as his starting point, Schopenhauer developed his own
				view of the world, which he expressed in clear, literary language. He took Kant’s
				view that the world is divided into what we perceive through our senses (phenomena),
				and “things in themselves” (noumena), but he wanted to explain the nature of the
				phenomenal and noumenal worlds.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-585"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000223.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-586" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Interpreting Kant</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to Kant, we each construct a version of the world from our
					perceptions&mdash;the phenomenal world&mdash;but we can never experience the noumenal world
					as it is “in itself.” So we each have a limited vision of the world, as our
					perceptions are built from information acquired through a limited set of senses.
					Schopenhauer adds to this that “every man takes the limits of his own field of
					vision for the limits of the world.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of knowledge being limited to our experience was not an entirely new
					one; the ancient philosopher Empedocles had said that “each man believes only
					his experience”, and in the 17th century John Locke had asserted that “no man’s
					knowledge here can go beyond his experience.” But the reason Schopenhauer gives
					for this limitation is quite new, and it comes from his interpretation of Kant’s
					phenomenal and noumenal worlds. The important difference between Kant and
					Schopenhauer is that for Schopenhauer, the phenomenal and noumenal are not two
					different realities or worlds, but the same world, experienced differently. It
					is one world, with two aspects: Will and Representation. This is most easily
					evidenced by our bodies, which we experience in two ways: we perceive them as
					objects (Representations), and experience them from within (as Will).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Schopenhauer says that an act of will, such as wishing to raise my arm, and
					the resulting movement, are not in two different worlds&mdash;the noumenal and
					phenomenal&mdash;but the same event experienced in two different ways. One is
					experienced from inside, the other observed from outside. When we look at things
					outside ourselves, although we see only their objective Representation, not
					their inner reality or Will, the world as a whole still has the same
					simultaneous outer and inner existences.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-587" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A universal Will</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Schopenhauer uses the word “will” to express a pure energy that has no driving
					direction, and yet is responsible for everything that manifests itself in the
					phenomenal world. He believes, like Kant, that space and time belong in the
					phenomenal world&mdash;they are concepts within our minds, not things outside of
					them&mdash;so the Will of the world does not mark time, or follow causal or spatial
					laws. This means it must be timeless and indivisible, and so must our individual
					wills. It follows, then, that the Will of the universe and individual will are
					one and the same thing, and the phenomenal world is controlled by this vast,
					timeless, motiveless Will.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-588"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000201.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Schopenhauer studied</span> the Hindu

					humanity at the mercy of a mindless, aimless universal Will. It lies behind our
					most basic urges, he insists, and is what causes us to live lives of constant
					disappointment and frustration as we attempt to relieve our cravings. For
					Schopenhauer, the world is neither good nor bad, but meaningless, and humans who
					struggle to find happiness achieve at best gratification and at worst pain and
					suffering.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The only escape from this miserable condition, according to Schopenhauer, is
					nonexistence or at least a loss of will for gratification. He proposes that
					relief can be found through aesthetic contemplation, especially in music, which
					is the one art that does not attempt to represent the phenomenal world.
					Schopenhauer’s philosophy here echoes the Buddhist concept of nirvana (a
					transcendent state free from desire or suffering). He had studied Eastern
					thinkers and religions in great detail.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From his idea of one universal Will, Schopenhauer develops a moral philosophy
					that may be somewhat surprising, considering his otherwise misanthropic and
					pessimistic character. He realizes that if we can recognize that our
					separateness from the universe is essentially an illusion&mdash;because all our
					individual wills and the Will of the universe are one and the same thing&mdash;we can
					learn empathy with everyone and everything else, and moral goodness can arise
					from a universal compassion. Here, again, Schopenhauer’s thinking reflects the
					ideals of Eastern philosophy.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"The fundament upon which all our knowledge and learning rests is the

					and his ideas were overshadowed by those of Hegel, though he did have an
					influence on writers and musicians. Toward the end of the 19th century, the
					primacy he gave to Will became a theme in philosophy once more. Friedrich
					Nietzsche in particular acknowledged his influence, and Henri Bergson and the
					American pragmatists also owe something to his analysis of the world as Will.
					Perhaps Schopenhauer’s greatest influence, however, was in the field of
					psychology, where his ideas about our basic urges and their frustration
					influenced the psychoanalytic theories of both Sigmund Freud and Carl
					Jung.</p></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-591"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-592"><img alt="" src="images/000177.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="intro">Born into a wealthy and cosmopolitan family in Danzig (now Gdansk),

				and he was aware from an early age of the British traditions of philosophy that had
				emerged during the Enlightenment of the 18th century. John Locke and David Hume had
				established a philosophy whose new empiricism stood in stark contrast to the
				rationalism of continental European philosophers. But during the late 18th century,
				Romantic ideas from Europe began to influence British moral and political
				philosophy. The most obvious product of this influence was utilitarianism, which was
				a very British interpretation of the political philosophy that had shaped the
				18th-century revolutions of both Europe and America. Its originator, Jeremy Bentham,
				was a friend of the Mill family, and he influenced John’s home education.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-599"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000090.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-600" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Victorian liberalism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As a philosopher Mill sets himself the task of synthesizing a valuable
					intellectual heritage with the new 19th-century Romanticism. His approach is
					less sceptical than that of Hume (who argued that all knowledge comes from sense
					experience, and nothing is certain) and less dogmatic than Bentham (who insisted
					that everything be judged on its usefulness), but their empiricism and
					utilitarianism informed his thinking. Mill’s moral and political philosophy is
					less extreme than his predecessors’, aiming for reform rather than revolution,
					and it formed the basis of British Victorian liberalism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing his first philosophical work, the exhaustive six-volume
						<i class="calibre12">System of Logic</i>, Mill turned his
					attention to moral philosophy, particularly Bentham’s theories of
					utilitarianism. He had been struck by the elegant simplicity of Bentham’s
					principle of “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”, and was a firm
					believer in its usefulness. He describes his interpretation of how
					utilitarianism might be applied as similar to Jesus of Nazareth’s “golden rule”:
					do as you would be done by, and love your neighbor as yourself. This, he says,
					constitutes “the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.”</p></div><div id="calibre_link-601" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Legislating for liberty</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Mill supports Bentham’s happiness principle, but he thinks it lacks
					practicality. Bentham had seen the idea as depending upon an abstract “felicific
					calculus” (an algorithm for calculating happiness), but Mill wants to find out
					how it might be implemented in the real world. He is interested in the social
					and political implications of the principle, rather than merely its use in
					making moral decisions. How would legislation promoting the “greatest happiness
					of the greatest number” actually affect the individual? Might laws that sought
					to do this, enacting a kind of majority rule, actually prevent some people from
					achieving happiness?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill thinks that the solution is for education and public opinion to work
					together to establish an “indissoluble association” between an individual’s
					happiness and the good of society. As a result, people would always be motivated
					to act not only for their own good or happiness, but toward that of everyone. He
					concludes that society should therefore allow all individuals the freedom to
					pursue happiness. Furthermore, he says that this right should be protected by
					the government, and that legislation should be drawn up to protect the
					individual’s freedom to pursue personal goals. There is, however, one situation
					in which this freedom should be curtailed, Mill says, and that is where one
					person’s action impinges on the happiness of others. This is known as the “harm
					principle.” He underlines this by pointing out that in these cases, a person’s
					“own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-602"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000375.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The good samaritan</span> helps his enemy in a

Bentham had
					considered the duration and intensity of pleasures in his felicific calculus,
					but Mill thinks it is also important to consider the quality of pleasure. By
					this, he is referring to the difference between a simple satisfaction of desires
					and sensual pleasures, and happiness gained through intellectual and cultural
					pursuits. In the “happiness equation” he gives more weight to higher,
					intellectual pleasures than to baser, physical ones.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with his empiricist background, Mill then tries to pin down the
					essence of happiness. What is it, he asks, that each individual is striving to
					achieve? What causes happiness? He decides that “the sole evidence it is
					possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually
					desire it.” This seems a rather unsatisfactory explanation, but he goes on to
					distinguish between two different desires: unmotivated desires (the things we
					want that will give us pleasure) and conscientious actions (the things we do out
					a sense of duty or charity, often against our immediate inclination, that
					ultimately bring us pleasure). In the first case, we desire something as a part
					of our happiness, but in the second we desire it as a means to our happiness,
					which is felt only when the act reaches its virtuous end.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-604" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Practical utilitarianism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Mill was not a purely academic philosopher, and he believed his ideas should
					be put into practice, so he considered what this might mean in terms of
					government and legislation. He saw any restriction of the individual’s freedom
					to pursue happiness as a tyranny, whether this was the collective tyranny of the
					majority (through democratic election) or the singular rule of a despot. He
					therefore suggested practical measures to restrict the power of society over the
					individual, and to protect the rights of the individual to free
					expression.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his time as a Member of Parliament, Mill proposed many reforms which were
					not to come about until much later, but his speeches brought the liberal
					applications of his utilitarian philosophy to the attention of a wide public. As
					a philosopher and politician, he argued strongly in defense of free speech, for
					the promotion of basic human rights, and against slavery&mdash;all of which were
					obvious practical applications of his utilitarianism. Strongly influenced by his
					wife Harriet Taylor-Mill, he was the first British parliamentarian to propose
					votes for women as part of his government reforms. His liberalist philosophy
					also encompassed economics, and contrary to his father’s economic theories, he
					advocated a free-market economy where government intervention is kept to a
					minimum.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-605"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000249.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The National Society</span> for Women’s

					utilitarian philosophy. What is important is that individuals are free to think
					and act as they please, without interference, even if what they do is harmful to
					them. Every individual, says Mill in his essay <i class="calibre12">On
						Liberty</i>, is “sovereign over his own body and mind.” His ideas
					came to embody Victorian liberalism, softening the radical ideas that had led to
					revolutions in Europe and America, and combining them with the idea of freedom
					from interference by authority. This, for Mill, is the basis for just governance
					and the means to social progress, which was an important Victorian ideal. He
					believes that if society leaves individuals to live in a way that makes them
					happy, it enables them to achieve their potential. This in turn benefits
					society, as the achievements of individual talents contribute to the good of
					all.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own lifetime Mill was regarded as a significant philosopher, and he is
					now considered by many to be the architect of Victorian liberalism. His
					utilitarian-inspired philosophy had a direct influence on social, political,
					philosophical, and economic thinking well into the 20th century. Modern
					economics has been shaped from various interpretations of his application of
					utilitarianism to the free market, notably by the British economist John Maynard
					Keynes. In the field of ethics, philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, Karl
					Popper, William James, and John Rawls all took Mill as their starting
					point.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"One person with a belief is a social power equal to 99 who have only

				idealist thinking that dominated continental Europe in the mid-19th century,
				particularly that of Georg Hegel. Kierkegaard wanted to refute Hegel’s idea of a
				complete philosophical system, which defined humankind as part of an inevitable
				historical development, by arguing for a more subjective approach. He wants to
				examine what “it means to be a human being”, not as part of some great philosophical
				system, but as a self-determining individual.</p><p class="calibre13">Kierkegaard believes that our lives are determined by our actions, which are
				themselves determined by our choices, so how we make those choices is critical to
				our lives. Like Hegel, he sees moral decisions as a choice between the hedonistic
				(self-gratifying) and the ethical. But where Hegel thought this choice was largely
				determined by the historical and environmental conditions of our times, Kierkegaard
				believes that moral choices are absolutely free, and above all subjective. It is our
				will alone that determines our judgement, he says. However, far from being a reason
				for happiness, this complete freedom of choice provokes in us a feeling of anxiety
				or dread.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kierkegaard explains this feeling in his book, <i class="calibre12">The Concept
					of Anxiety</i>. As an example, he asks us to consider a man standing on a
				cliff or tall building. If this man looks over the edge, he experiences two
				different kinds of fear: the fear of falling, and fear brought on by the impulse to
				throw himself off the edge. This second type of fear, or anxiety, arises from the
				realization that he has absolute freedom to choose whether to jump or not, and this
				fear is as dizzying as his vertigo. Kierkegaard suggests that we experience the same
				anxiety in all our moral choices, when we realize that we have the freedom to make
				even the most terrifying decisions. He describes this anxiety as “the dizziness of
				freedom”, and goes on to explain that although it induces despair, it can also shake
				us from our unthinking responses by making us more aware of the available choices.
				In this way it increases our self-awareness and sense of personal
				responsibility.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-611"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000285.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-612" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The father of existentialism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Kierkegaard’s ideas were largely rejected by his contemporaries, but proved
					highly influential to later generations. His insistence on the importance and
					freedom of our choices, and our continual search for meaning and purpose, was to
					provide the framework for existentialism. This philosophy, developed by
					Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, was later fully defined by Jean-Paul
					Sartre. It explores the ways in which we can live meaningfully in a godless
					universe, where every act is a choice, except the act of our own birth. Unlike
					these later thinkers, Kierkegaard did not abandon his faith in God, but he was
					the first to acknowledge the realization of self-consciousness and the
					“dizziness” or fear of absolute freedom.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-613"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000309.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Hamlet is caught</span> on the edge of a

					Danish Golden Age of culture. His father, a wealthy tradesman, was both pious
					and melancholic, and his son inherited these traits, which were to greatly
					influence his philosophy. Kierkegaard studied theology at the University of
					Copenhagen, but attended lectures in philosophy. When he came into a sizeable
					inheritance, he decided to devote his life to philosophy. In 1837 he met and
					fell in love with Regine Olsen, and three years later they became engaged, but
					Kierkegaard broke off the engagement the following year, saying that his

				formula? One of the greatest thinkers of the 19th century, Karl Marx, believed that
				it could. He opened the first chapter of his most famous work, <i class="calibre12">The Communist Manifesto</i>, with the claim that all
				historical change comes about as the result of an ongoing conflict between dominant
				(upper) and subordinate (lower) social classes, and that the roots of this conflict
				lie in economics.</p><p class="calibre13">Marx believed that he had gained a uniquely important insight into the nature of
				society through the ages. Earlier approaches to history had emphasized the role of
				individual heroes and leaders, or stressed the role played by ideas, but Marx
				focused on a long succession of group conflicts, including those between ancient
				masters and slaves, medieval lords and serfs, and modern employers and their
				employees. It was conflicts between these classes, he claimed, that caused
				revolutionary change.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-618"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000210.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-619" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Communist Manifesto</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Marx wrote the <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i> with the German
					philosopher Friedrich Engels, whom he had met when they were both studying
					academic philosophy in Germany during the late 1830s. Engels offered financial
					support, ideas, and superior writing skills, but Marx was acknowledged as the
					real genius behind their combined publications.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In their private manuscripts from the early and mid-1840s, Marx and Engels
					emphasized that while previous philosophers had only sought to interpret the
					world, the whole point of their activities was to change it. During the 1850s
					and 60s Marx refined his ideas in many short documents, including <i class="calibre12">The Communist Manifesto</i>, a pamphlet of about 40
					pages.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i> seeks to explain the values
					and political plans of communism&mdash;a new belief system put forward by a small and
					relatively new group of radical German socialists. The <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i> claims that society had simplified into two classes in
					direct conflict: the bourgeoisie (the capital-owning class) and the proletariat
					(the working class).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The word “bourgeoisie” is derived from the French word <i class="calibre12">burgeis</i>, or burgher: a property-owning tradesman who had risen
					above the general populace to own and run his own business. Marx describes how
					the discovery and colonization of America, the opening of the Indian and Chinese
					markets, and the increase in the commodities that could be exchanged had, by the
					mid-19th century, led to the rapid development of commerce and industry.
					Craftsmen no longer produced enough goods for the growing needs of new markets,
					and so the manufacturing system had taken their place. As the <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i> relates, “the markets kept growing,
					demand ever rising.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-620"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000189.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Intellectual debate</span> was widespread in
							Germany at the time Marx was writing, though he himself believed that it
							was the task of philosophy not to discuss ideas, but to bring about real
							change.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-621" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Values of the bourgeoisie</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Marx claims that the bourgeoisie, who controlled all this trade, had left no
					link between people other “than naked self-interest, than callous ‘cash
					payment.’” People were once valued for who they were, but the
					bourgeoisie “has resolved personal worth into exchange value.” Moral,
					religious, and even sentimental values had been cast aside, as everyone&mdash;from
					scientists and lawyers to priests and poets&mdash;had been transformed into nothing
					but a paid laborer. In place of religious and political “illusions”, Marx
					writes, the bourgeoisie had “substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal
					exploitation.” Charters that had once protected people’s freedom had been
					cast aside for one “unconscionable freedom&mdash;Free Trade.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution, according to Marx, was for all the instruments of economic
					production (such as land, raw materials, tools, and factories) to become common
					property, so that every member of society could work according to their
					capacities, and consume according to their needs. This was the only way to
					prevent the rich from living at the expense of the poor.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-622" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dialectical change</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The philosophy behind Marx’s reasoning on the process of change came largely
					from his predecessor, Georg Hegel, who had described reality not as a state of
					affairs, but as a process of continual change. The change was caused, he said,
					by the fact that every idea or state of affairs (known as the “thesis”) contains
					within it an internal conflict (the “antithesis”) that eventually forces a
					change to occur, leading to a new idea or state of affairs (the “synthesis”).
					This process is known as the dialectic.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegel believed that we can never experience things in the world as they are,
					but only as they appear to us. For him, existence primarily consists of mind or
					spirit, so the journey of history, through countless cycles of the dialectic, is
					essentially the progress of spirit, or <i class="calibre12">Geist</i>,
					toward a state of absolute harmony. But it is here that Hegel and Marx part
					company. Marx insists that the process is not a journey of spiritual
					development, but of real historical change. Marx claims that the final,
					conflict-free state that lies at the end of the process is not the spiritual
					bliss that Hegel predicted, but the perfect society, where everyone works
					harmoniously toward the good of a greater whole.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his

					they needed&mdash;such as clothing, food, and habitation&mdash;for themselves, but as the
					early societies began to form, people came to rely more on one another. This led
					to the form of “bargain making” described by the Scottish economist and
					philosopher Adam Smith, as people exchanged goods or labor. Marx agrees with
					Smith that this system of exchange led people to specialize in their labor, but
					he points out that this new specialization (or “job”) had also come to define
					them. Whatever a person’s specialization or job, be it agricultural laborer or
					hereditary landowner, it had come to dictate where he or she lived, what they
					ate, and what they wore; it also dictated with whom in society they shared
					interests, and with whom their interests lay in conflict. Over time, this led to
					the formation of distinct socio-economic classes, locked into conflict.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Marx, there have been four major stages in human history, which
					he sees as based on four different forms of property ownership: the original
					tribal system of common property; the ancient communal and state system of
					ownership (where both slavery and private property began); the feudal or estate
					system of property; and the modern system of capitalist production. Each of
					these stages represents a different form of economic system, or “mode of
					production”, and the transitions between them are marked in history by stormy
					political events, such as wars and revolutions, as one ruling class is displaced
					by another. <i class="calibre12">The Communist Manifesto</i>
					popularized the idea that through understanding the system of property ownership
					in any one society, in any particular era, we can acquire the key to
					understanding its social relations.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-624"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000345.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The wealthy bourgeoisie</span> enjoyed the

					allows us to see that as its system of property alters, so too do its
					“superstructures”&mdash;such as its politics, laws, art,
					religions, and philosophies. These develop to serve the interests of the ruling
					class, promoting its values and interests, and diverting attention away from
					political realities. However, even this ruling class is not, in fact,
					determining events or institutions. Hegel had said that every age is held in the
					sway of the <i class="calibre12">Zeitgeist</i>, or spirit of the age,
					and Marx agrees. But where Hegel saw the <i class="calibre12">Zeitgeist</i> as determined by an Absolute Spirit developing over
					time, Marx sees it as defined by the social and economic relations of an era.
					These define the ideas or “consciousness” of individuals and societies. In
					Marx’s view, people do not make a stamp on their era, molding it into a
					particular shape; the era defines the people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx’s revision of Hegel’s philosophy from a journey of spirit to one of
					social and economic modes of production was also influenced by another German
					philosopher, Ludwig Feuerbach. Feuerbach believed that traditional religion is
					intellectually false&mdash;it is not corroborated in any way by reasoning&mdash;and that it
					contributes to the general sum of human misery. He claimed that people make gods
					in their own image from an amalgamation of humanity’s greatest virtues, and then
					cling to these gods and invented religions, preferring their “dreams” to the
					real world. People become alienated from themselves, through an unfavorable
					comparison of their selves to a god that they have forgotten they
					created.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx agrees that people cling to religion because they long for a place in
					which the self is not despised or alienated, but he says that this is not due to
					some authoritarian god, but to material facts in their actual, daily lives. The
					answer for Marx lies not only in the end of religion, but in total social and
					political change.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is

					bourgeois and proletarian classes, <i class="calibre12">The Communist
						Manifesto</i> makes a variety of other claims about politics,
					society, and economics. For example, it argues that the capitalist system is not
					merely exploitative, but also inherently financially unstable, leading to the
					recurrence of increasingly severe commercial crises, the growing poverty of the
					workforce, and the emergence of the proletariat as the one genuinely
					revolutionary class. For the first time in history, this revolutionary class
					would represent the vast majority of humanity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments are seen as underpinned by the increasingly complex nature
					of the process of production. Marx predicted that as technology improved, it
					would lead to increasing unemployment, alienating more and more people from the
					means of production. This would split society in two, between the large numbers
					of impoverished people and the few who owned and controlled the means of
					production. Following the rules of the dialectic, this conflict would result in
					a violent revolution to establish a new, classless society. This would be the
					utopian, conflict-free society that marked the end of the dialectic. Marx
					thought this perfect society would not require government, but only
					administration, and this would be carried out by the leaders of the revolution:
					the communist “party” (by which he means those who adhered to the cause, rather
					than any specific organization). Within this new kind of state (which Marx
					called the “dictatorship of the proletariat”) people would enjoy genuine
					democracy and social ownership of wealth. Shortly after this final change in the
					mode of production to a perfect society, Marx predicted, political power as it
					had previously been understood would come to an end, because there would be no
					good reason for political dissent or criminality.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-627"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000218.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Industrial Revolution</span> saw the

					between the bourgeoisie and the wage-earning working class would become evident
					only when the great mass of people had become property-less and were obliged to
					sell their labor for wages. The juxtaposition of poverty with the great wealth
					of the few would become increasingly obvious, he thought, and communism would
					become increasingly attractive.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Marx did not expect the opponents of communism to give up their
					privileges easily. In every period of history, the ruling class has enjoyed the
					advantage of controlling both the government and the law as a way of reinforcing
					their economic dominance. The modern state, he said, was actually a “committee
					for managing the affairs of the bourgeois class”, and struggles by excluded
					groups to have their own interests taken into account&mdash;such as the battle to
					extend the right to vote&mdash;were simply short-term ways in which the more
					fundamental economic conflict found expression. Marx saw political interests and
					parties as merely vehicles for the economic interests of the ruling classes,
					which were forced to appear as though they were acting in the general interest
					in order to gain and maintain power.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-630" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The road to revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Marx’s originality lies in his combination of pre-existing ideas rather than
					the creation of new ones. His system uses insights from German idealist
					philosophers, especially Georg Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach; from French political
					theorists, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau; and from British political economists,
					particularly Adam Smith. Socialism had become a recognized political doctrine in
					the first half of the 19th century, and from this Marx derives several insights
					about property, class, exploitation, and commercial crises.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Class conflict was certainly in the air when Marx composed the <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i>. It was written just before a succession
					of revolutions against the monarchies of many continental European countries
					broke out in 1848 and 1849. In the preceding decades, a significant number of
					people had migrated from the countryside to the towns in search of work,
					although continental Europe had not yet seen the industrial development that had
					taken place in Britain. A wave of discontent felt by the poor against the status
					quo was exploited by a variety of liberal and nationalist politicians, and
					revolutions rippled across Europe, although ultimately these uprisings were
					defeated and led to little permanent change.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the <i class="calibre12">Manifesto</i> acquired an iconic
					status during the 20th century, inspiring revolutions in Russia, China, and many
					other countries. The brilliance of Marx’s theories has been proved wrong in
					practice: the extent of repression in Stalinist Russia, in Mao Zedong’s China,
					and in Pol Pot’s Cambodia, has widely discredited his political and historical
					theories.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"A specter is haunting Europe&mdash;the specter of communism."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Karl Marx</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-631" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Criticism of Marxism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Although Marx did not foresee communism being implemented in such a barbaric
					manner in these primarily agricultural societies, his ideas are nevertheless
					still open to a variety of criticisms. First, Marx always argued for the
					inevitability of revolution. This was the essential part of the dialectic, but
					it is clearly too simplistic, as human creativity is always able to produce a
					variety of choices, and the dialectic fails to allow for the possibility of
					improvement by gradual reform.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Marx tended to invest the proletariat with wholly good attributes, and
					to suggest that a communist society would give rise somehow to a new type of
					human being. He never explained how the dictatorship of this perfect proletariat
					would be different from earlier, brutal forms of dictatorship, nor how it would
					avoid the corrupting effects of power.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Marx rarely discussed the possibility that new threats to liberty might
					emerge after a successful revolution; he assumed that poverty was the only real
					cause of criminality. His critics have also alleged that he did not sufficiently
					understand the forces of nationalism, and that he gave no proper account of the
					role of personal leadership in politics. In fact, the 20th-century communist
					movement was to produce immensely powerful personality cults in virtually every
					country in which communists came to power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-632"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000377.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Marxist states</span> of the 20th century

					Russian-British philosopher, Isaiah Berlin, that the <i class="calibre12">The

				of science who pioneered the philosophical movement known as pragmatism. Deeply
				sceptical of metaphysical ideas&mdash;such as the idea that there is a “real” world beyond
				the world we experience&mdash;he once asked his readers to consider what is wrong with the
				following theory: a diamond is actually soft, and only becomes hard when it is
				touched.</p><p class="calibre13">Peirce argued that there is “no falsity” in such thinking, for there is no way of
				disproving it. However, he claimed that the meaning of a concept (such as “diamond”
				or “hard”) is derived from the object or quality that the concept relates to&mdash;and the
				effects it has on our senses. Whether we think of the diamond as “soft until
				touched” or “always hard” before our experience, therefore, is irrelevant. Under
				both theories the diamond feels the same, and can be used in exactly the same way.
				However, the first theory is far more difficult to work with, and so is of less
				value to us.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea, that the meaning of a concept is the sensory effect of its object, is
				known as the pragmatic maxim, and it became the founding principle of pragmatism&mdash;the
				belief that the “truth” is the account of reality that works best for us.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key things Peirce was trying to accomplish was to show that many
				debates in science, philosophy, and theology are meaningless. He claimed that they
				are often debates about words, rather than reality, because they are debates in
				which no effect on the senses can be specified.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"Nothing is vital for science; nothing can be."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Charles Sanders Peirce</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre3">John Locke</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-36" class="calibre3">Immanuel Kant</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-32" class="calibre3">William James</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-33" class="calibre3">John Dewey</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-131" class="calibre3">Richard Rorty</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				find its feet as an independent nation, philosophers from New England such as Henry
				David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson gave a recognizably American slant to European
				Romantic ideas. But it was the following generation of philosophers, who lived
				almost a century after the Declaration of Independence, that came up with something
				truly original.</p><p class="calibre13">The first of these, Charles Sanders Peirce, proposed a theory of knowledge he
				called pragmatism, but his work was hardly noticed at the time; it fell to his
				lifelong friend William James&mdash;godson to Ralph Emerson&mdash;to champion Peirce’s ideas and
				develop them further.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-643"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000027.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-644" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Truth and usefulness</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Central to Peirce’s pragmatism was the theory that we do not acquire knowledge
					simply by observing, but by doing, and that we rely on that knowledge only so
					long as it is useful, in the sense that it adequately explains things for us.
					When it no longer fulfils that function, or better explanations make it
					redundant, we replace it. For example, we can see by looking back in history how
					our ideas about the world have changed constantly, from thinking that Earth is
					flat to knowing it to be round; from assuming that Earth is the center of the
					universe, to realizing that it is just one planet in a vast cosmos. The older
					assumptions worked perfectly adequately as explanations in their time, yet they
					are not true, and the universe itself has not changed. This demonstrates how
					knowledge as an explanatory tool is different from facts. Peirce examined the
					nature of knowledge in this way, but James was to apply this reasoning to the
					notion of truth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For James, the truth of an idea depends on how useful it is; that is to say,
					whether or not it does what is required of it. If an idea does not contradict
					the known facts&mdash;such as laws of science&mdash;and it does provide a means of
					predicting things accurately enough for our purposes, he says there can be no
					reason not to consider it true, in the same way that Peirce considered knowledge
					as a useful tool irrespective of the facts. This interpretation of truth not
					only distinguishes it from fact, but also leads James to propose that “the truth
					of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth <i class="calibre12">happens</i> to an idea. It becomes true, is made true
					by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process.” Any idea, if acted upon,
					is found to be true by the action we take; putting the idea into practice is the
					process by which it becomes true.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;James also thinks that belief in an idea is an important factor in choosing to
					act upon it, and in this way belief is a part of the process that makes an idea
					true. If I am faced with a difficult decision, my belief in a particular idea
					will lead to a particular course of action and so contribute to its success. It
					is because of this that James defines “true beliefs” as those that prove useful
					to the believer. Again, he is careful to distinguish these from facts, which he
					says “are not true. They simply are. Truth is the function of the beliefs that
					start and terminate among them.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Every way of classifying a thing is but a way of handling it for some
						particular purpose."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">William James</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-645"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000340.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The idea of a flat Earth</span> served well as
							a “truth” for several thousand years, despite the fact that Earth is a

							truthfulness.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-646" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The right to believe</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Every time we try to establish a new belief, it would be useful if we had all
					the available evidence and the time to make a considered decision. But in much
					of life we do not have that luxury; either there is not enough time to examine
					the known facts, or there is not enough evidence, and we are forced to a
					decision. We have to rely on our beliefs to guide our actions, and James says
					that we have “the right to believe” in these cases.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;James explains this by taking the example of a man lost and starving in a
					forest. When he sees a path, it is important for him to believe that the path
					will lead him out of the forest and to habitation, because if he does not
					believe it, he will not take the path, and will remain lost and starving. But if
					he does, he will save himself. By acting on his idea that the path will lead him
					to safety, it becomes true. In this way our actions and decisions make our
					belief in an idea become true. This is why James asserts “act as if what you do
					makes a difference”&mdash;to which he adds the typically concise and good-humored
					rider, “it does.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, approach this idea with caution: a shallow interpretation of
					what James is saying could give the impression that any belief, no matter how
					outlandish, could become true by acting upon it&mdash;which of course is not what he
					meant. There are certain conditions that an idea must fulfil before it can be
					considered a justifiable belief. The available evidence must weigh in its favor,
					and the idea must be sufficient to withstand criticism. In the process of acting
					upon the belief, it must continually justify itself by its usefulness in
					increasing our understanding or predicting results. And even then, it is only in
					retrospect that we can safely say that the belief has become true through our
					acting upon it.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-647"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000190.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Religious belief</span> can bring about

					implications of his ideas in terms of human psychology as much as in the theory
					of knowledge. He recognized the psychological necessity for humans to hold
					certain beliefs, particularly religious ones. James thinks that while it is not
					justifiable as a fact, belief in a god is useful to its believer if it allows
					him or her to lead a more fulfilled life, or to overcome the fear of death.
					These things&mdash;a more fulfilled life and a fearless confrontation of death&mdash;become
					true; they happen as the result of a belief, and the decisions and actions based
					upon it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with his pragmatic notion of truth, James proposes a type of metaphysics
					that he calls “radical empiricism.” This approach takes reality to
					be a dynamic, active process, in the same way that truth is a process. Like the
					traditional empiricists before him, James rejected the rationalist notion that
					the changing world is in some way unreal, but he also went further to state that
					“for pragmatism, [reality] is still in the making”,
					as truth is constantly being made to happen. This “stream” of
					reality, he believes, is not susceptible to empirical analysis either, both
					because it is in continual flux and because the act of observing it affects the
					truth of the analysis. In James’s radical empiricism, from which both
					mind and matter are formed, the ultimate stuff of reality is pure
					experience.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"The pragmatic method means looking away from principles and looking

					a significant center for philosophical thought in the 20th century. James’s
					pragmatic interpretation of truth influenced the philosophy of John Dewey, and
					spawned a “neopragmatist” school of thought in America that includes
					philosophers such as Richard Rorty. In Europe, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig
					Wittgenstein were indebted to James’s metaphysics. His work in psychology was
					equally influential, and often intimately connected with his philosophy, notably
					his concept of the “stream of consciousness”, which in turn influenced writers
					such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.</p></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-650"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">WILLIAM JAMES</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-651"><img alt="" src="images/000184.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="intro">Born in New York City, William James was brought up in a wealthy and

					19 he abandoned this to study science. His studies at Harvard Medical School
					were interrupted by the ill health and depression that were to prevent him from
					ever practicing medicine, but he eventually graduated and in 1872 took a
					teaching post in physiology at Harvard University. His increasing interest in
					the subjects of psychology and philosophy led him to write acclaimed
					publications in these fields, and he was awarded a professorship in philosophy
					at Harvard in 1880.

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-153"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Toward the end of the 19th century, philosophy once again reached a
				turning point. Science, and particularly Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution
				(1859), had thrown into doubt the idea of the universe as God’s creation, with
				humankind as the peak of his creative genius. Moral and political philosophy had
				become entirely human-centered, with Karl Marx declaring religion “the opiate of the
				people.” Following in the footsteps of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche
				believed that Western philosophy, with its roots in Greek and Judaeo-Christian
				traditions, was ill-equipped to explain this modern world view. He proposed a
				radical new approach to finding meaning in life, one that involved casting aside old
				values and traditions. In doing so, he set the agenda for much of the philosophy of
				the 20th century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-652"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000346.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-653" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A new analytical tradition</h2></div><p class="calibre14">To some extent, the traditional concerns of philosophy&mdash;such as asking what
					exists&mdash;were answered by science in the early 20th century. Albert Einstein’s
					theories offered a more detailed explanation of the nature of the universe, and
					Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theories gave people a radically new insight into
					the workings of the mind.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, philosophers turned their attention to questions of moral and
					political philosophy or, since philosophy had become the province of
					professional academics, to the more abstract business of logic and linguistic
					analysis. At the vanguard of this movement of logical analysis&mdash;which became
					known as analytic philosophy&mdash;was the work of Gottlob Frege, who linked the
					philosophical process of logic with mathematics. His ideas were enthusiastically
					received by a British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell applied the principles of logic that Frege had outlined to a thorough
					analysis of mathematics in the <i class="calibre12">Principia
						Mathematica</i>, which he wrote with Alfred North Whitehead, and
					then&mdash;in a move that revolutionized philosophical thinking&mdash;he applied the same
					principles to language. The process of linguistic analysis was to become the
					major theme in 20th century British philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Russell’s pupils, Ludwig Wittgenstein, developed Russell’s work on
					logic and language, but also made key contributions in areas as diverse as
					perception, ethics, and aesthetics, becoming one of the greatest thinkers of the
					20th century. Another, slightly younger Viennese philosopher, Karl Popper, took
					his cue from Einstein, and strengthened the link between scientific thinking and
					philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, in Germany, philosophers rose to the challenge posed by Nietzsche’s
					ideas with a philosophy based on the experience of the individual in a godless
					universe: existentialism. Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology (the study of
					experience) laid the groundwork, and this was carried forward by Martin
					Heidegger, who was also greatly influenced by the Danish philosopher, Søren
					Kierkegaard. Heidegger’s work, produced in the 1920s and 30s, was largely
					rejected in the mid-20th century due to his connections with the Nazi party
					during World War II, but his works were key to the development of
					existentialism, and were important to late 20th-century culture.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-654" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Wars and revolutions</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Philosophy was as affected by the massive political upheavals of the 20th
					century as any other cultural activity, but it also contributed to the
					ideologies that shaped the modern world. The revolution that formed the Soviet
					Union in the 1920s had its roots in Marxism, a 19th-century political
					philosophy. This theory became more prevalent globally than any single religion,
					dominating the policy of China’s Communist Party until around 1982, and
					replacing traditional philosophies across Asia.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberal democracies in Europe during the 1930s were threatened by fascism,
					forcing many thinkers to flee from the continent to Britain and the US.
					Philosophers turned their attention to left-wing or liberal politics in reaction
					to the oppression they experienced under totalitarian regimes. World War II and
					the Cold War that followed it colored the moral philosophy of the second half of
					the 20th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In France, existentialism was made fashionable by Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de
					Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, who were all novelists. This trend was in keeping
					with the French view of philosophy as part of an essentially literary culture.
					It was also fundamental to the direction that continental philosophy was to take
					in the last decades of the 20th century.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					<i class="calibre12">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, perhaps his most
				famous book. It was written in three parts in 1883&ndash;84, with a fourth part added in
				1885. The German philosopher used it to launch a sustained attack on the history of
				Western thought. He targets three linked ideas in particular: first, the idea we
				have of “man” or human nature; second, the idea we have of God; and third, the ideas
				we have about morality, or ethics.</p><p class="calibre13">Elsewhere Nietzsche writes about philosophizing “with a hammer”, and here he
				certainly attempts to shatter many of the most cherished views of the Western
				philosophical tradition, especially in relation to these three things. He does so in
				a style that is astonishingly hot-headed and fevered, so that at times the book
				seems closer to prophecy than philosophy. It was written quickly, with Part I taking
				him only a few days to set down on paper. Even so, while Nietzsche’s book does not
				have the calm, analytical tone that people have perhaps come to expect of
				philosophical works, the author still succeeds in setting out a remarkably
				consistent and hugely challenging vision.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-657"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000119.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-658" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Zarathustra descends</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The name of Nietzsche’s prophet, Zarathustra, is an alternative name for the
					ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster. The book begins by telling us that at the age
					of 30, Zarathustra goes to live in the mountains. For ten years he delights in
					the solitude, but one dawn, he wakes to find that he is weary of the wisdom he
					has accumulated alone on the mountain. So he decides to descend to the market
					place to share this wisdom with the rest of humankind.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down to the town, at the foot of the hill, he meets with an old
					hermit. The two men have already met, ten years before, when Zarathustra first
					ascended the mountain. The hermit sees that Zarathustra has changed during the
					past decade: when he climbed the mountain, the hermit says, Zarathustra carried
					ashes; but now, as he descends, he is carrying fire.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hermit asks Zarathustra a question: why are you going to the trouble
					of sharing your wisdom? He advises Zarathustra to stay in the mountains, warning
					him that nobody will understand his message. Zarathustra then asks a question:
					what does the hermit do in the mountains? The hermit replies that he sings,
					weeps, laughs, mumbles, and praises God. On hearing this, Zarathustra himself
					laughs. Then he wishes the hermit well and continues on his way down the
					mountain. As he goes, Zarathustra says to himself, “How can it be possible! This
					old hermit has not yet heard that God is dead.”</p></div><div id="calibre_link-659" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Behold the Superman</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The idea of the death of God may be the most famous of all Nietzsche’s ideas,
					and it is closely related both to the idea that man is something to be surpassed
					and to Nietzsche’s distinctive understanding of morality. The relationship
					between these things becomes clear as the story continues.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When he reaches the town, Zarathustra sees that there is a crowd gathered
					around a tightrope walker who is about to perform, and he joins them. Before the
					acrobat has a chance to walk across his rope, Zarathustra stands up. It is at
					this point that he says, “Behold! I teach you the Superman!” He continues by
					telling the crowd the real point he wishes to convey: “Man is something to
					surpassed….” Zarathustra follows this with a long speech, but when he gets to
					the end, the crowd only laughs, imagining that the prophet is just another
					showman, or perhaps even a warm-up performer for the tightrope-walker.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In opening his book in this unusual way, Nietzsche seems to be betraying his
					own unease with the reception that his philosophy will receive, as if he is
					afraid that he will be seen as a philosophical showman without anything real to
					say. If we want to avoid making the same mistake as the crowd gathered around
					Zarathustra, and actually understand what Nietzsche is saying, it is necessary
					to explore some of Nietzsche’s core beliefs.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-660"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000252.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The prophet Zoroaster</span> (c.628&ndash;551 BCE),

							between good and evil. Nietzsche’s Zarathustra places himself “beyond
							good and evil.”</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-661" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Overturning old values</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Nietzsche believes that certain concepts have become inextricably entangled:
					humankind, morality, and God. When his character Zarathustra says that God is
					dead, he is not simply launching an attack upon religion, but doing something
					much bolder. “God” here does not only mean the god that philosophers talk about
					or the religious pray to; it means the sum total of the higher values that we
					might hold. The death of God is not just the death of a deity; it is also the
					death of all the so-called higher values that we have inherited.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the central purposes of Nietzsche’s philosophy is what he calls the
					“revaluation of all values”, an attempt to call into question all of the ways
					that we are accustomed to thinking about ethics and the meanings and purposes of
					life. Nietzsche repeatedly maintains that in doing so he is setting out a
					philosophy of cheerfulness, which, although it overturns everything we have
					thought up until now about good and evil, nevertheless seeks to affirm life. He
					claims that many of the things that we think are “good” are, in fact, ways of
					limiting, or of turning away from, life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;We may think it is not “good” to make a fool of ourselves in public, and so
					resist the urge to dance joyfully in the street. We may believe that the desires
					of the flesh are sinful, and so punish ourselves when they arise. We may stay in
					mind-numbing jobs, not because we need to, but because we feel it is our duty to
					do so. Nietzsche wants to put an end to such life-denying philosophies, so that
					humankind can see itself in a different way.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-662"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000126.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Existing between</span> the levels of animal
							and Superman, human life, Nietzsche says, is “a dangerous wayfaring, a
							dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.”</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-663" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Blaspheming against life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">After Zarathustra proclaims the coming of the Superman, he swiftly moves to
					condemn religion. In the past, he says, the greatest blasphemy was to blaspheme
					against God; but now the greatest blasphemy is to blaspheme against life itself.
					This is the error that Zarathustra believes he made upon the hillside: in
					turning away from the world, and in offering up prayers to a God who is not
					there, he was sinning against life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The history behind this death of God, or loss of faith in our higher values,
					is told in Nietzsche’s essay, <i class="calibre12">How the “Real World” at
						last Became a Myth</i>, which was published in <i class="calibre12">Twilight of the Idols</i>. The essay carries the
					subtitle “History of an Error”, and it is an extraordinarily condensed one-page
					history of Western philosophy. The story begins, Nietzsche says, with the Greek
					philosopher Plato.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"Man is a rope tied between the animal and the Superman&mdash;a rope over an
						abyss."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Friedrich Nietzsche</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-664" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The real world</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Plato divided the world into an “apparent” world that appears to us through
					our senses, and a “real” world that we can grasp through the intellect. For
					Plato, the world we perceive through the senses is not “real” because it is
					changeable and subject to decay. Plato suggests that there is also an
					unchanging, permanent “real world” that can be attained with the help of the
					intellect. This idea comes from Plato’s study of mathematics. The form or idea
					of a triangle, for example, is eternal and can be grasped by the intellect. We
					know that a triangle is a three-sided, two-dimensional figure whose angles add
					up to 180º, and that this will always be true, whether anyone is thinking about
					it or not and however many triangles exist in the world. On the other hand, the
					triangular things that do exist in the world (such as sandwiches, pyramids, and
					triangular shapes drawn on a chalkboard), are triangular only insofar as they
					are reflections of this idea or form of the triangle.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenced by mathematics in this way, Plato proposed that the intellect can
					gain access to a whole world of Ideal Forms, which is permanent and unchanging,
					whereas the senses have access only to the world of appearances. So, for
					example, if we want to know about goodness, we need to have an intellectual
					appreciation of the Form of Goodness, of which the various examples of goodness
					in the world are only reflections. This is an idea that has had far-reaching
					consequences for our understanding of the world; not least because, as Nietzsche
					points out, this way of dividing up the world makes the “real world” of the
					intellect the place where everything of value resides. In contrast, it makes the
					“apparent world” of the senses a world that is, relatively speaking,
					unimportant.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-665"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000409.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Some religions and philosophies</span> insist
							that a more important “real world” exists elsewhere. Nietzsche sees this
							as a myth that tragically prevents us from living fully now, in this
							world.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-666" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Christian values</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Nietzsche traces the fortunes of this tendency to split the world into two and
					finds that the same idea appears within Christian thought. In place of the “real
					world” of Plato’s Forms, Christianity substitutes an alternative “real world”; a
					future world of heaven that is promised to the virtuous. Nietzsche believes that
					Christianity views the world we live in now as somehow less real than heaven,
					but in this version of the “two worlds” idea the “real world” is attainable,
					albeit after death and on condition that we follow Christian rules in this life.
					The present world is devalued, as it is with Plato, except insofar as it acts as
					a stepping stone to the world beyond. Nietzsche claims that Christianity asks us
					to deny the present life in favor of the promise of a life to come.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Platonic and Christian versions of the idea that the world is divided
					into a “real” and an “apparent” one have profoundly affected our thoughts about
					ourselves. The suggestion that everything of value in the world is somehow
					“beyond” the reach of this world leads to a way of thinking that is
					fundamentally life-denying. As a result of this Platonic and Christian heritage,
					we have come to see the world we live in as a world that we should resent and
					disdain, a world from which we should turn away, transcend, and certainly not
					enjoy. But in doing so, we have turned away from life itself in favor of a myth
					or an invention, an imagined “real world” that is situated elsewhere. Nietzsche
					calls priests of all religions “preachers of death”, because their teachings
					encourage us to turn from this world, and from life to death. But why does
					Nietzsche insist that God is dead? To answer this, we must look to the work of
					the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, whose ideas are critical to
					understanding the philosophy behind Nietzsche’s work.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-667"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000287.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Superman</span> is someone of enormous
							strength and independence in mind and body; Nietzsche denied any had
							existed, but named Napoleon, Shakespeare, and Socrates as models.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-668" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A world beyond reach</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Kant was interested in the limits of knowledge. In his book <i class="calibre12">Critique of Pure Reason</i>, he argued that we cannot
					know the world as it is “in itself.” We cannot attain it with the intellect, as
					Plato believed; nor is it promised to us after death as in the Christian view.
					It exists (we assume), but it is forever out of reach. The reasons that Kant
					uses to come up with this conclusion are complex, but what is important from
					Nietzsche’s point of view is that, if the real world is said to be absolutely
					unattainable&mdash;even to the wise or the virtuous, in this world or the next&mdash;then it
					is “an idea grown useless, superfluous.” As a result, it is an idea that we need
					to do away with. If God is dead, Nietzsche is perhaps the person who stumbles
					across the corpse; nevertheless, it is Kant whose fingerprints are all over the
					murder weapon.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-669" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Philosophy’s longest error</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Once we have dispensed with the idea of the “real world”, the long-held
					distinction between the “real world” and the “apparent world” begins to break
					down. In <i class="calibre12">How the “Real World” at last Became a
						Myth</i>, Nietzsche goes on to explain this as follows: “We have
					abolished the real world; what world is left? The apparent world, perhaps? … But
					no! With the real world we have also abolished the apparent world.” Nietzsche
					now sees the beginning of the end of philosophy’s “longest error”: its
					infatuation with the distinction between “appearance” and “reality”, and the
					idea of two worlds. The end of this error, Nietzsche writes, is the zenith of
					mankind&mdash;the high point of all humanity. It is at this point&mdash;in an essay written
					six years after <i class="calibre12">Thus Spake Zarathustra</i>&mdash;that
					Nietzsche writes “Zarathustra begins.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a key moment for Nietzsche because when we grasp the fact that there
					is only one world, we suddenly see the error that had put all values beyond this
					world. We are then forced to reconsider all our values and even what it means to
					be human. And when we see through these philosophical illusions, the old idea of
					“man” can be surpassed. The Superman is Nietzsche’s vision of a fundamentally
					life-affirming way of being. It is one that can become the bearer of meaning not
					in the world beyond, but here; Superman is “the meaning of the Earth.”</p></div><div id="calibre_link-670" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Creating ourselves</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Nietzsche’s writings did not reach a large audience in his lifetime, so much
					so that he had to pay for the publication of the final part of <i class="calibre12">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> himself. But around 30 years
					after his death in 1900, the idea of the Superman fed into the rhetoric of
					Nazism through Hitler’s readings of Nietzsche’s work. Nietzsche’s ideas about
					the Superman, and particularly his call for an eradication of the
					Jewish-Christian morality that held sway throughout Europe would have been
					attractive to Hitler as validation for his own aims. But where Nietzsche seemed
					to be searching for a return to the more rustic, life-affirming values of pagan
					Europe, Hitler took his writings as an excuse for unbridled violence and
					transgression on a grand scale. The consensus amongst scholars is that Nietzsche
					himself would have been horrified by this turn of events. Writing in an era of
					extraordinary nationalism, patriotism, and colonial expansion, Nietzsche was one
					of the few thinkers to call these assumptions into question. At one point in
						<i class="calibre12">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> he makes it clear
					that he considers nationalism a form of alienation or failure. “Only where the
					state ends,” Zarathustra says, “there begins the human being who is not
					superfluous.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nietzsche’s open-ended idea of human possibility was important to many
					philosophers in the period following World War II. His ideas about religion and
					the importance of self-evaluation can be traced especially in the work of
					succeeding existentialists such as the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Like
					Nietzsche’s Superman, Sartre says that we must each define the meaning of our
					own existence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nietzsche’s damning criticisms of the Western philosophical tradition have had
					a huge impact not only on philosophy, but also on European and world culture,
					and they went on to influence countless artists and writers in the 20th
					century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-671"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000057.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Nietzsche’s writings</span> were edited and

					University, where he met the composer Richard Wagner, who influenced him
					strongly until Wagner’s anti-semitism forced Nietzsche to end their friendship.
					In 1870 he contracted diphtheria and dysentery, and thereafter suffered
					continual ill health. He was forced to resign his professorship in 1879, and for
					the next ten years travelled in Europe. In 1889 he collapsed in the street while

				is a sound-image. This is not the actual sound, but the mental “image” we have of
				the sound. Secondly, the “signified”, or concept. Here Saussure turns his back on a
				long tradition that says language is about the relationships between words and
				things, because he is saying that both aspects of a sign are mental (our concept of
				a “dog” for example, and a sound-image of the sound “dog”). Saussure claims that any
				message&mdash;for example “my dog is called Fred”&mdash;is a system of signs. This means that it
				is a system of relationships between sound-images and concepts. However, Saussure
				states that the relationship between the signified and the signifier is arbitrary&mdash;so

				thinkers since the time of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates: the dream of
				certainty. For Socrates, the problem was this: although we easily reach agreement on
				questions about things we can measure (for example, “how many olives are there in
				this jar?”), when it comes to philosophical questions such as “what is justice?” or
				“what is beauty?”, it seems that there is no clear way of reaching agreement. And if
				we cannot know for certain what justice is, then how can we say anything about it at
				all?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-681"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000347.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-682" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The problem of certainty</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Husserl was a philosopher who started life as a mathematician. He dreamed that
					problems such as “what is justice?” might be solved with the same degree of
					certainty with which we are able to solve mathematical problems such as “how
					many olives are in the jar?” In other words, he hoped to put all the sciences&mdash;by
					which he meant all branches of human knowledge and activity, from math,
					chemistry, and physics to ethics and politics&mdash;on a completely secure
					footing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific theories are based on experience. But Husserl believed that
					experience alone did not add up to science, because as any scientist knows,
					experience is full of all kinds of assumptions, biases, and misconceptions.
					Husserl wanted to drive out all of these uncertainties to give science
					absolutely certain foundations.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, Husserl made use of the philosophy of the 17th-century philosopher
					René Descartes. Like Husserl, Descartes wanted to free philosophy from all
					assumptions, biases, and doubts. Descartes wrote that although almost everything
					could be doubted, he could not doubt that he was doubting.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-683" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Phenomenology</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Husserl takes up a similar approach to Descartes, but uses it differently. He
					suggests that if we adopt a scientific attitude to experience, laying aside
					every single assumption that we have (even including the assumption that an
					external world exists outside of us), then we can start philosophy with a clean
					slate, free of all assumptions. Husserl calls this approach phenomenology: a
					philosophical investigation of the phenomena of experience. We need to look at
					experience with a scientific attitude, laying to one side (or “bracketing out”
					as Husserl calls it) every single one of our assumptions. And if we look
					carefully and patiently enough, we can build a secure foundation of knowledge
					that might help us deal with the philosophical problems that have been with us
					since the very beginnings of philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, different philosophers following Husserl’s method came to different
					results, and there was little agreement as to what the method actually was, or
					how one carried it out. Toward the end of his career, Husserl wrote that the
					dream of putting the sciences on firm foundations was over. But although
					Husserl’s phenomenology failed to provide philosophers with a scientific

					which is knowing things as they actually are. Bergson believes that these are
					reached by different methods, the first through analysis or intellect, and the
					second through intuition. Kant’s mistake, Bergson believes, is that he does not
					recognize the full importance of our faculty of intuition, which allows us to
					grasp an object’s uniqueness through direct connection. Our intuition is linked
					to what Bergson called our <i class="calibre12">é</i><i class="calibre12">lan vital</i>, a life-force (vitalism) that
					interprets the flux of experience in terms of time rather than space.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you want to get to know a city, he says. You could compile a record of

					would be grasping it at one remove, not as a living city. If, on the other hand,
					you were simply to stroll around the streets, paying attention in the right way,
					you might acquire knowledge of the city itself&mdash;a direct knowledge of the city as
					it actually is. This direct knowledge, for Bergson, is knowledge of the essence
					of the city.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But how do we practice intuition? Essentially, it is a matter of seeing the
					world in terms of our sense of unfolding time. While walking through the city,
					we have a sense of our own inner time, and we also have an inner sense of the
					various unfolding times of the city through which we are walking. As these times
					overlap, Bergson believes that we can make a direct connection with the essence

				which arose in the US in the late 19th century. The founder is generally considered
				to be the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who wrote a groundbreaking essay in
				1878 called <i class="calibre12">How to Make our Ideas Clear</i>.</p><p class="calibre13">Pragmatism starts from the position that the purpose of philosophy, or “thinking”,
				is not to provide us with a true picture of the world, but to help us to act more
				effectively within it. If we are taking a pragmatic perspective, we should not be
				asking “is this the way things are?” but rather, “what are the practical
				implications of adopting this perspective?”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dewey, philosophical problems are not abstract problems divorced from people’s
				lives. He sees them as problems that occur because humans are living beings trying
				to make sense of their world, struggling to decide how best to act within it.
				Philosophy starts from our everyday human hopes and aspirations, and from the
				problems that arise in the course of our lives. This being the case, Dewey thinks
				that philosophy should also be a way of finding practical responses to these
				problems. He believes that philosophizing is not about being a “spectator” who looks
				at the world from afar, but about actively engaging in the problems of life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-696"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000145.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-697" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Evolving creatures</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Dewey was strongly influenced by the evolutionary thought of the naturalist
					Charles Darwin, who published <i class="calibre12">On The Origin of
						Species</i> in 1859. Darwin described humans as living creatures who
					are a part of the natural world. Like the other animals, humans have evolved in
					response to their changing environments. For Dewey, one of the implications of
					Darwin’s thought is that it requires us to think of human beings not as fixed
					essences created by God, but instead as natural beings. We are not souls who
					belong in some other, non-material world, but evolved organisms who are trying
					to do our best to survive in a world of which we are inescapably a part.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-698" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Everything changes</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Dewey also takes from Darwin the idea that nature as a whole is a system that
					is in a constant state of change; an idea that itself echoes the philosophy of
					the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus. When Dewey comes to think about what
					philosophical problems are, and how they arise, he takes this insight as a
					starting point.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dewey discusses the idea that we only think when confronted with problems in
					an essay entitled <i class="calibre12">Kant and the Philosophic
						Method</i> (1884). We are, he says, organisms that find ourselves
					having to respond to a world that is subject to constant change and flux.
					Existence is a risk, or a gamble, and the world is fundamentally unstable. We
					depend upon our environment to be able to survive and thrive, but the many
					environments in which we find ourselves are themselves always changing. Not only
					this, but these environments do not change in a predictable fashion. For several
					years there may be a good crop of wheat, for instance, but then the harvest
					fails. A sailor may set sail under fine weather, only to find that a storm
					suddenly blows up out of nowhere. We are healthy for years, and then disease
					strikes us when we least expect it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this uncertainty, Dewey says that there are two different
					strategies we can adopt. We can either appeal to higher beings and hidden forces
					in the universe for help, or we can seek to understand the world and gain
					control of our environment.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"We do not solve philosophical problems, we get over them."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">John Dewey</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-699" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Appeasing the gods</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The first of these strategies involves attempting to affect the world by means
					of magical rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices. This approach to the uncertainty
					of the world, Dewey believes, forms the basis of both religion and
					ethics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the story that Dewey tells, our ancestors worshipped gods and spirits as a
					way of trying to ally themselves with the “powers that dispense fortune.” This
					scenario is played out in stories from around the world, in myths and legends
					such as those about unfortunate seafarers who pray to gods or saints to calm the
					storm, and thereby survive. In the same way, Dewey believes, ethics arises out
					of the attempts our ancestors made to appease hidden forces; but where they made
					sacrifices, we strike bargains with the gods, promising to be good if they spare
					us from harm.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative response to the uncertainties of our changing world is to
					develop various techniques of mastering the world, so that we can live in it
					more easily. We can learn the art of forecasting the weather, and build houses
					to shelter ourselves from its extremes, and so on. Rather than attempting to
					ally ourselves with the hidden powers of the universe, this strategy involves
					finding ways of revealing how our environment works, and then working out how to
					transform it to our benefit.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dewey points out that it is important to realize that we can never completely
					control our environment or transform it to such an extent that we can drive out
					all uncertainty. At best, he says, we can modify the risky, uncertain nature of
					the world in which we find ourselves. But life is inescapably risky.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-700"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000030.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">We no longer employ sacrifice</span> as a way

							being.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-701" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A luminous philosophy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">For much of human history, Dewey writes, these two approaches to dealing with
					the riskiness of life have existed in tension with each other, and they have
					given rise to two different kinds of knowledge: on the one hand, ethics and
					religion; and on the other hand, arts and technologies. Or, more simply,
					tradition and science. Philosophy, in Dewey’s view, is the process by means of
					which we try to work through the contradictions between these two different
					kinds of response to the problems in our lives. These contradictions are not
					just theoretical; they are also practical. For example, I may have inherited
					innumerable traditional beliefs about ethics, meaning, and what constitutes a
					“good life”, but I may find that these beliefs are in tension with the knowledge
					and understanding that I have gained from studying the sciences. In this context
					philosophy can be seen as the art of finding both theoretical and practical
					responses to these problems and contradictions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which to judge whether a form of philosophy is
					successful. First, we should ask whether it has made the world more
					intelligible. Does this particular philosophical theory make our experience
					“more luminous”, Dewey asks, or does it make it “more opaque”? Here Dewey is
					agreeing with Peirce that philosophy’s purpose is to make our ideas and our
					everyday experience clearer and easier to understand. He is critical of any
					philosophical approaches that ultimately make our experience more puzzling, or
					the world more mysterious.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he thinks we should judge a philosophical theory by asking to what
					extent it succeeds in addressing the problems of living. Is it useful to us, in
					our everyday lives? Does it, for instance, “yield the enrichment and increase of
					power” that we have come to expect from new scientific theories?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-702"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000317.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Scientific experiments</span>, such as those
							performed by Benjamin Franklin in the 1740s, help us gain control over
							the world. Dewey thought philosophical theories should be equally
							useful.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-703" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A practical influence</h2></div><p class="calibre14">A number of philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell, have criticized pragmatism
					by claiming that it has simply given up on the long philosophical quest for
					truth. Nevertheless, Dewey’s philosophy has been enormously influential in
					America. Given that Dewey places such an overriding emphasis on responding to
					the practical problems of life, it is perhaps unsurprising that much of his
					influence has been in practical realms, such as in education and in
					politics.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"Education is not an affair of telling and being told, but an active and

					broad range of topics, from education to democracy, psychology, and art. In
					addition to his work as a scholar, he set up an educational institution&mdash;the
					University of Chicago Laboratory Schools&mdash;which put into practice his
					educational philosophy of learning by doing. This institution is still running
					today. Dewey’s broad range of interests, and his abilities as a communicator,
					allowed his influence on American public life to extend far beyond the
					Laboratory Schools. He wrote about philosophy and social issues until he died in

				are condemned to repeat it, and this is sometimes understood to mean that we must do
				our best to remember past atrocities. But Santayana is actually making a point about

				human life. But Unamuno’s response to suffering is very different. Unlike the
				Buddha, Unamuno does not see suffering as a problem to be overcome through
				practicing detachment. Instead he argues that suffering is an essential part of what
				it means to exist as a human being, and a vital experience.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;If all consciousness amounts to consciousness of human mortality and suffering, as
				Unamuno claims, and if consciousness is what makes us distinctively human, then the
				only way we can lend our lives a kind of weight and substance is to embrace this
				suffering. If we turn away from it, we are not only turning away from what makes us
				human, we are also turning away from consciousness itself.</p><div id="calibre_link-711" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Love or happiness</h2></div><p class="calibre14">There is also an ethical dimension to Unamuno’s ideas on suffering. He claims
					that it is essential to acknowledge our pain, because it is only when we face
					the fact of our own suffering that we become capable of truly loving other
					suffering beings. This presents us with a stark choice. On the one hand, we can
					choose happiness and do our best to turn away from suffering. On the other hand,
					we can choose suffering and love.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first choice may be easier, but it is a choice that ultimately limits
					us&mdash;indeed, severs us from an essential part of ourselves. The second choice is
					more difficult, but it is one that opens the way to the possibility of a life of
					depth and significance.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-82" class="calibre3">Siddhartha Gautama</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-11" class="calibre3">St Augustine of Hippo</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-26" class="calibre3">Martin Heidegger</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre3">Albert Camus</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-40" class="calibre3">Jean-Paul Sartre</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				political radical, and civil rights activist, William Du Bois, wrote what has become
				known as his last message to the world. Knowing that he did not have much longer to
				live, he penned a short passage to be read at his funeral. In this message, Du Bois
				expresses his hope that any good he has done will survive long enough to justify his
				life, and that those things he has left undone, or has done badly, may be taken up
				by others to be bettered or completed.</p><p class="calibre13">“Always,” Du Bois writes, “human beings will live and progress to a greater,
				broader, and fuller life.” This is a statement of belief rather than a statement of
				fact. It is as if Du Bois is saying that we must believe in the possibility of a
				fuller life, or in the possibility of progress, to be able to progress at all. In
				this idea, Du Bois shows the influence of the American philosophical movement known
				as Pragmatism, which claims that what matters is not just our thoughts and beliefs,
				but also the practical implications of these thoughts and beliefs.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bois goes on to say that the “only possible death” is to lose one’s belief in
				the prospects for human progress. But there are also hints of deeper philosophical
				roots here, going all the way back to the ancient Greek idea of <i class="calibre12">eudaimonia</i> or “human flourishing”; for the philosopher
				Aristotle, this involved living a life of excellence based upon virtue and
				reason.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-714"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000354.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">William Du Bois</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-715" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Political activist</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Du Bois considers two of the major impediments to a life of excellence to be

					people are inferior genetically to white people&mdash;that was prevalent throughout
					most of his life. As racial inequality has no basis in biological science, he
					regards it as a purely social problem, one that can be addressed only by
					committed political and social activism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bois is tireless in his search for solutions to the problem of all forms of
					social inequality. He argues that social inequality is one of the major causes
					of crime, claiming that lack of education and employment are correlated with
					high levels of criminal activity. In his final message to the world, Du Bois
					reminds us that the task of bringing about a more just society is still
					incomplete. He states that it is up to future generations to believe in life, so
					that we can continue to contribute to the fulfilment of “human
					flourishing.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-716"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000254.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Martin Luther King Jr.</span> cited Du Bois’

				work. His collected writings fill countless volumes; he was responsible for some of
				the most important developments in 20th-century philosophy, including the founding
				of the school of analytic philosophy; and throughout his long life&mdash;he died aged
				97&mdash;he was a tireless social activist. So why is this most active of thinkers
				suggesting that we should work less?</p><p class="calibre13">Russell’s essay <i class="calibre12">In Praise of Idleness</i> was first
				published in 1932, in the middle of the Great Depression, a period of global
				economic crisis following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. It might seem distasteful
				to promote the virtues of idleness at such a time, when unemployment was rising to a
				third of the working population in some parts of the world. For Russell, however,
				the economic chaos of the time was itself the result of a set of deep-rooted and
				mistaken attitudes about work. Indeed, he claims that many of our ideas about work
				are little more than superstitions, which should be swept away by rigorous
				thinking.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-721"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000288.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-722" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">What is work?</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Russell begins by defining work, which he says is of two kinds. First, there
					is work aimed at “altering the position of matter at or near the earth’s surface
					relative to other such matter.” This is the most fundamental sense of work&mdash;that
					of manual labor. The second kind of work is “telling other people to alter the
					position of matter relative to other such matter.” This second kind of work,
					Russell says, can be extended indefinitely&mdash;not only can you have people employed
					to supervise people who move matter, but others can be employed to supervise the
					supervisors, or give advice on how to employ other people, while still more can
					be employed to manage the people who give advice on how to employ people, and so
					on. The first kind of work, he says, tends to be unpleasant and badly paid,
					while the second tends to be more pleasant, and better paid. These two types of
					work define two types of worker&mdash;the laborer and the supervisor&mdash;and
					these in turn relate to two social classes&mdash;the working class and the
					middle class. But to these Russell adds a third class, who he claims has a lot
					to answer for&mdash;that of the leisured landowner who avoids all work, and who
					depends on the labor of others to support his or her idleness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Russell, history is littered with examples of people working hard
					all their lives and being allowed to keep just enough for themselves and their
					families to survive, while any surplus they produce is appropriated by warriors,
					priests, and the leisured ruling classes. And it is always these beneficiaries
					of the system, says Russell, who are heard extolling the virtues of “honest
					toil”, giving a moral gloss to a system that is manifestly unjust. And this fact
					alone, according to Russell, should prompt us to re-evaluate the ethics of work,
					for by embracing “honest toil” we comply with and even promote our own
					oppression.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell’s account of society, with its emphasis on the struggle between
					classes, owes something to the thought of the 19th-century philosopher Karl
					Marx, although Russell was always uneasy with Marxism, and his essay is as
					critical of Marxist states as it is of capitalist states. His view also owes
					much to Max Weber’s book <i class="calibre12">The Protestant Ethic and the
						Spirit of Capitalism</i>, first published in 1905, particularly
					Weber’s examination of the moral claims that underlie our attitudes to
					work&mdash;claims that Russell insists should be challenged.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, not only do we see work as a duty and an obligation, we also see
					different types of work as occupying a hierarchy of virtue. Manual work is
					generally considered less virtuous than more skilled or intellectual work, and
					we tend to reward people in accordance with this perceived virtue rather than
					for what they produce. And given that we consider work itself to be inherently
					virtuous, we tend to see the unemployed as lacking in virtue.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The more we think about it, the more it seems that our attitudes toward work
					are both complex and incoherent. What, then, can be done? Russell’s suggestion
					is that we look at work not in terms of these curious moral ideas that are a
					relic of earlier times, but in terms of what makes for a full and satisfying
					human life. And when we do this, Russell believes, it is hard to avoid the
					conclusion that we should all simply work less. What, Russell asks, if the
					working day were only four hours long? Our present system is such that part of
					the population can be overworked, and so miserable, while another part can be
					totally unemployed, and so also miserable. This, it seems, does not benefit
					anyone.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Bertrand Russell</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-723"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000160.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Great Depression</span> was the worst

					creative interests. “Moving matter about,” Russell writes, “is emphatically not
					one of the ends of human life.” If we allow work to occupy every waking hour, we
					are not living fully. Russell believes that leisure, previously something known
					only to the privileged few, is necessary for a rich and meaningful life. It
					might be objected that nobody would know what to do with their time if they
					worked only for four hours a day, but Russell regrets this. If this is true, he
					says, “it is a condemnation of our civilization,” suggesting that our capacity
					for play and light-heartedness has been eclipsed by the cult of efficiency. A
					society that took leisure seriously, Russell believes, would be one that took
					education seriously&mdash;because education is surely about more than training
					for the workplace. It would be one that took the arts seriously, because there
					would be time to produce works of quality without the struggle that artists have
					for economic independence. Moreover, it would be one that took the need for
					enjoyment seriously. Indeed, Russell believes that such a society would be one
					in which we would lose the taste for war because, if nothing else, war would
					involve “long and severe work for all.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has
						no need of slavery."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Bertrand Russell</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-725" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The balanced life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Russell’s essay may appear to present something of a Utopian vision of a world
					in which work is reduced to a minimum. It is not entirely clear how, even if it
					were possible to reduce the working day to four hours, this change would lead to
					the social revolution that Russell claims. Nor is Russell’s faith in the idea
					that industrialization can ultimately free us from manual labor entirely
					convincing. The raw materials for industrial production still need to come from
					somewhere. They need to be mined and refined and exported to the place of
					production, all of which depends on manual labor. Despite these problems,
					Russell’s reminder that we need to look more closely at our attitudes to work is
					one that remains relevant today. We take as “natural” the length of the working
					week and the fact that some kinds of work are rewarded more than others. For
					many of us, neither our work nor our leisure are as fulfilling as we believe
					they could be, and at the same time we cannot help feeling that idleness is a
					vice. Russell’s idea reminds us that not only do we need to scrutinize our
					working lives, but that there is a virtue and a usefulness to lounging, loafing,
					and idling. As Russell says: “Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as
					we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is
					no reason to go on being foolish forever.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-726"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000031.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Leisure time</span>, for Russell, should no
							longer be spent merely recovering from work. On the contrary, it should
							constitute the largest part of our lives and be a source of play and
							creativity.</p></div></div></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-727"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">BERTRAND RUSSELL</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-728"><img alt="" src="images/000318.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="intro">Bertrand Russell was born in Wales in 1872 to an aristocratic family.

				detached fashion. Instead, he wants to explore how philosophy can engage creatively
				with life. Reason, Ortega believes, is not something passive, but something
				active&mdash;something that allows us to get to grips with the circumstances in which we
				find ourselves, and allows us to change our lives for the better.</p><p class="calibre13">In his <i class="calibre12">Meditations on Quixote</i>, published in
				1914, Ortega writes: “I am myself and my circumstances.” Descartes said that it was
				possible to imagine ourselves as thinking beings, and yet to doubt the existence of
				the external world, including our own bodies. But Ortega says that it makes no sense
				to see ourselves as separate from the world. If we want to think seriously about
				ourselves, we have to see that we are always immersed in particular
				circumstances&mdash;circumstances that are often oppressive and limiting. These
				limitations are not only those of our physical surroundings, but also of our
				thoughts, which contain prejudices, and our behavior, which is shaped by
				habit.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;While many people live without reflecting on the nature of their circumstances,
				Ortega says that philosophers should not only strive to understand their
				circumstances better, they should actively seek to change them. Indeed, he claims
				that the philosopher’s duty is to expose the assumptions that lie behind all our
				beliefs.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-738"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000256.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-739" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The energy of life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In order to transform the world and to engage creatively with our own

					means not only looking anew at our external circumstances, but also looking
					inside ourselves to reconsider our beliefs and prejudices. Only when we have
					done this will we be able to commit ourselves to creating new
					possibilities.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a limit to the amount that we can change the world. Our
					habitual thinking runs deep, and even if we free ourselves enough to imagine new
					possibilities and new futures, our external circumstances may stand in the way
					of realizing these possibilities. The futures that we imagine will always
					collide with the reality of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. This
					is why Ortega sees life as a series of collisions with the future.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ortega’s idea is challenging on both a personal and a political level. It
					reminds us that we have a duty to attempt to change our circumstances, even
					though we may encounter difficulties in doing so, and even though our attempts
					may not always succeed. In <i class="calibre12">The Revolt of the
						Masses</i>, he warns that democracy carries within it the threat of
					tyranny by the majority, and that to live by majority rule&mdash;to live “like
					everyone else”&mdash;is to live without a personal vision or moral code. Unless we
					engage creatively with our own lives, we are hardly living at all. This is why

				it is one that Japanese philosopher Tanabe Hajime wants us to take seriously. If we
				want to philosophize, Tanabe believes, we cannot do so without making a confession.
				But what is it that we should confess, and why? To answer these questions, we need
				to look at the roots of Tanabe’s philosophy in both the European and the Japanese
				traditions of philosophy. In terms of its European roots, Tanabe traces his thought
				back to the Greek philosopher Socrates who lived in the 5th century BCE. Socrates is
				important to Tanabe because of the way he frankly confessed that he knew nothing.
				According to the story, the oracle at Delphi said that Socrates was the wisest man
				in Athens, and Socrates, who was certain of his own ignorance, set out to prove the
				oracle wrong. After innumerable conversations with people in Athens, he came to the
				conclusion that he was indeed the wisest person in the city, because he alone could
				accept that he knew nothing.</p><p class="calibre13">The Japanese roots of Tanabe’s idea go back to the thought of the Buddhist monk
				Shinran, who belonged to what is known as the Pure Land school of Buddhism.
				Shinran’s innovation was his claim that enlightenment is impossible if we rely on
				our own power. Instead, we must confess our own ignorance and limitations, so that
				we are open to what both Shinran and Tanabe call <i class="calibre12">tariki</i>, or “other power.” In the context of Pure Land Buddhism, this
				other power is that of the Buddha Amitabha. In the context of Tanabe’s philosophy,
				confession leads to a recognition of “absolute nothingness”, and ultimately to
				self-awakening and wisdom.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-745"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000155.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-746"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000130.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Buddha Amitabha</span>, here shown between

					logic, or about arguing or debating anything&mdash;it is not, in fact, an
					“intellectual” discipline. For Tanabe, it is something much more fundamental&mdash;a
					process of relating, in the deepest possible sense, to our very own being&mdash;an
					idea that is partly shaped by his reading of Martin Heidegger. It is only
					through confessing, Tanabe believes, that we can rediscover our true being&mdash;a
					process he describes in directly religious terms as a form of death and
					resurrection. This death and resurrection is the rebirth of the mind through
					“other power”, and its passing from the limited view of the “self” to the
					perspective of enlightenment. However, this shift is not simply a preparation
					for philosophy&mdash;on the contrary, it is the very work of philosophy itself, which
					is rooted in scepticism and the “forsaking of ourselves to the grace of other
					power.” Philosophy, in other words, is not an activity that we engage in, but
					something that happens through us when we gain access to our true selves by
					letting go of the self&mdash;a phenomenon that Tanabe calls “action without an acting
					subject.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continual confession is, Tanabe writes, “the ultimate conclusion” to which the
					recognition of our limitations drives us. In other words, Tanabe asks us not to
					find new answers to old philosophical questions, but to re-evaluate the very
					nature of philosophy.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"For a problem to belong to philosophy, there must be something

							different ways of viewing language.</p></div><p class="intro">Wittgenstein’s <i class="calibre12">Tractatus
					Logico-Philosophicus</i> is perhaps one of the most forbidding texts in
				the history of 20th-century philosophy. Only around 70 pages long in its English
				translation, the book is made up of a series of highly condensed and technical
				numbered remarks.</p><p class="calibre13">In order to appreciate the full significance of the <i class="calibre12">Tractatus,</i> it is important to set it within its philosophical
				context. The fact that Wittgenstein is talking about the “limits” of my language and
				my world sets him firmly within the philosophical tradition that stems from the
				18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In <i class="calibre12">The
					Critique of Pure Reason</i>, Kant set out to explore the limits of
				knowledge by posing questions such as “What can I know?” and “What things will lie
				forever outside of human understanding?” One reason that Kant asked such questions
				was that he believed many problems in philosophy arose because we fail to recognize
				the limitations of human understanding. By turning our attention back onto ourselves
				and asking about the necessary limits of our knowledge, we can then either resolve,
				or even perhaps dissolve, nearly all of the philosophical problems of the
				past.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i> tackles the same kind of task
				that Kant did, but does so in a far more radical fashion. Wittgenstein states that
				he is setting out to make clear what can be meaningfully said. In much the same way
				that Kant strives to set the limits of reason, Wittgenstein wants to set the limits
				of language and, by implication, of all thought. He does this because he suspects
				that a great deal of philosophical discussion and disagreement is based on some
				fundamental errors in how we go about thinking and talking about the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-751"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000072.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of the

						<i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i> are essentially based on a
					fairly simple principle, that both language and the world are formally
					structured, and that these structures can be broken down into their component
					parts. Wittgenstein attempts to lay bare the structures both of the world and of
					language, and then to show the way they relate to each other. Having done this,
					he attempts to draw a number of wide-reaching philosophical conclusions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to understand what Wittgenstein means when he says that limits of my
					language are the limits of my world, we need to ask what he means by the words
					“world” and “language”, because he does not use these words in the everyday
					sense we might expect. When he talks about language, the debt Wittgenstein owes
					to the British philosopher Bertrand Russell becomes apparent. For Russell, who
					was an important figure in the development of philosophical logic, everyday
					language was inadequate for talking clearly and precisely about the world. He
					believed that logic was a “perfect language”, which excluded all traces of
					ambiguity, so he developed a way of translating everyday language into what he
					considered a logical form.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic is concerned with what are known in philosophy as propositions. We can
					think of propositions as assertions that it is possible for us to consider as
					being either true or false. For example, the statement “the elephant is very
					angry” is a proposition, but the word “elephant” is not. According to
					Wittgenstein’s <i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i>, meaningful language
					must consist solely of propositions. “The totality of propositions,” he writes,
					“is language.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing a little about what Wittgenstein means by language, we can now explore
					what he means by “the world.” The <i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i>
					begins with the claim that “the world is all that is the case.” This might
					appear to be straightforward and robustly matter-of-fact, but taken on its own,
					it is not entirely clear what Wittgenstein means by this statement. He goes on
					to write that “the world is the totality of facts, not of things.” Here we can
					see a parallel between the way that Wittgenstein treats language and the way he
					is treating the world. It may be a fact, for example, that the elephant is
					angry, or that there is an elephant in the room, but an elephant just by itself
					is not a fact.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point, it begins to become clear how the structure of language and
					that of the world might be related. Wittgenstein says that language “pictures”
					the world. He formulated this idea during World War I, when he read in a
					newspaper about a court case in Paris. The case concerned a car accident, and
					the events were re-enacted for those present in court using model cars and model
					pedestrians to represent the cars and pedestrians in the real world. The model
					cars and the model pedestrians were able to depict their counterparts, because
					they were related to each other in exactly the same way as the real cars and
					real pedestrians involved in the accident. Similarly, all the elements depicted
					on a map are related to each other in exactly the same way as they are in the
					landscape that the map represents. What a picture shares with that which it is
					depicting, Wittgenstein says, is a logical form.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important here to realize that we are talking about logical pictures,
					and not about visual pictures. Wittgenstein presents a useful example to show
					what he means. The sound waves generated by a performance of a symphony, the
					score of that symphony, and the pattern formed by the grooves on a gramophone
					recording of the symphony all share between them the same logical form.
					Wittgenstein states, “A picture is laid against reality like a measure.” In this
					way it can depict the world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our picture may be incorrect. It may not agree with reality, for
					example, by appearing to show that the elephant is not angry when the elephant
					is, in fact, very angry. There is no middle ground here for Wittgenstein.
					Because he starts with propositions that are, by their very nature, true or
					false, pictures also are either true or false.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Language and the world, then, both have a logical form; and language can speak
					about the world by picturing the world, and picturing it in a fashion that
					agrees with reality. It is at this point that Wittgenstein’s idea gets really
					interesting, and it is here that we can see why Wittgenstein is interested in
					the limits of language.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following idea: “You should give half of your salary to charity.”
					This is not picturing anything in the world in the sense meant by Wittgenstein.
					What can be said&mdash;what Wittgenstein calls the “totality of true propositions”&mdash;is
					merely the sum of all those things that are the case, or the natural
					sciences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion about religious and ethical values is, for Wittgenstein, strictly
					meaningless. Because the things that we are attempting to talk about when we
					discuss such topics are beyond the limits of the world, they also lie beyond the
					limits of our language. Wittgenstein writes, “It is clear that ethics cannot be
					put into language.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-753"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000048.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The ancient Egyptians</span> arranged symbols

					the sciences, driving out vague concepts involved in talk of ethics, religion,
					and the like. But something more complex is going on. Wittgenstein does not
					think that the “problems of life” are nonsensical. Instead, he believes that
					these are the most important problems of all. It is simply that they cannot be
					put into words, and because of this, they cannot become a part of philosophy.
					Wittgenstein writes that these things, even though we cannot speak of them,
					nevertheless make themselves manifest, adding that “they are what is
					mystical.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this, however, has serious repercussions for the propositions that lie
					within the <i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i> itself. After all, these
					are not propositions that picture the world. Even logic, one of Wittgenstein’s
					major tools, does not say anything about the world. Is the <i class="calibre12">Tractatus,</i> therefore, nonsense? Wittgenstein
					himself was fearless in following his argument to its conclusion, ultimately
					recognizing that the answer to such a question must be yes. Anybody who
					understands the <i class="calibre12">Tractatus</i> properly, he
					claims, will eventually see that the propositions used in it are nonsense, too.
					They are like the steps of a philosophical ladder that helps us to climb
					altogether beyond the problems of philosophy, but which we can kick away once we
					have ascended.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-756"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000000.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Philosophy demands</span> logical, unambiguous

					Wittgenstein concluded that there were no more philosophical problems left to

				deal of thought, they came up with the following answer: “a human being is a
				featherless biped.” Everybody seemed content with this definition until Diogenes the
				Cynic burst into the lecture hall with a live plucked chicken, shouting, “Behold! I
				present you with a human being.” After the commotion had died down, the philosophers
				reconvened and refined their definition. A human being, they said, is a featherless
				biped with broad nails.</p><p class="calibre13">This curious story from the history of early philosophy shows the kinds of
				difficulties philosophers have sometimes been faced with when attempting to give
				abstract, general definitions of what it is to be human. Even without the
				intervention of Diogenes, it seems clear that describing ourselves as featherless
				bipeds does not really capture much of what it means to be human.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-762"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000337.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-763" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An insider’s perspective</h2></div><p class="calibre14">It is this question&mdash;how we might go about analyzing what it is to be
					human&mdash;that concerned the philosopher Martin Heidegger. When Heidegger came to
					answer the question, he did so in a way that was strikingly different from many
					of his predecessors. Instead of attempting an abstract definition that looks at
					human life from the outside, he attempts to provide a much more concrete
					analysis of “being” from what could be called an insider’s position. He says
					that since we exist in the thick of things&mdash;in the midst of life&mdash;if we want to
					understand what it is to be human, we have to do so by looking at human life
					from within this life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidegger was a student of Husserl, and he followed Husserl’s method of
					phenomenology. This is a philosophical approach that looks at phenomena&mdash;how
					things appear&mdash;through examining our experience of them. For example,
					phenomenology would not look directly at the question “what is a human being?”
					but would instead look at the question “what is it like to be human?”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"The question of existence never gets straightened out except through

He was
					most interested in the philosophical subject of ontology (from the Greek word
						<i class="calibre12">ontos</i>, meaning “being”), which looks at
					questions about being or existence. Examples of ontological questions might be:
					“what does it mean to say that something exists?” and “what are the different
					kinds of things that exist?” Heidegger wanted use the question “what is it like
					to be human?” as a way of answering deeper questions about existence in
					general.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book, <i class="calibre12">Being and Time</i>, Heidegger
					claims that when other philosophers have asked ontological questions, they have
					tended to use approaches that are too abstract and shallow. If we want to know
					what it means to say that something exists, we need to start looking at the
					question from the perspective of those beings for whom being is an issue. We can
					assume that although cats, dogs, and toadstools are beings, they do not wonder
					about their being: they do not fret over ontological questions; they do not ask
					“what does it mean to say that something exists?” But there is, Heidegger points
					out, one being that does wonder about these things, and that is the human being.
					In saying that we are ourselves the entities to be analyzed, Heidegger is saying
					that we if we want to explore questions of being, we have to start with
					ourselves, by looking at what it means for us to exist.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-765"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000311.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">We try to make sense</span> of the world by

					abstract ideas, but about something very direct and immediate. In the opening
					pages of his book, he says that the meaning of our being must be tied up with
					time; we are essentially temporal beings. When we are born, we find ourselves in
					the world as if we had been thrown here on a trajectory we have not chosen. We
					simply find that we have come to exist, in an ongoing world that pre-existed us,
					so that at our birth we are presented with a particular historical, material,
					and spiritual environment. We attempt to make sense of this world by engaging in
					various pastimes&mdash;for example, we might learn Latin, or attempt to find true
					love, or decide to build ourselves a house. Through these time-consuming
					projects we literally project ourselves toward different possible futures; we
					define our existence. However, sometimes we become aware that there is an
					outermost limit to all our projects, a point at which everything we plan will
					come to an end, whether finished or unfinished. This point is the point of our
					death. Death, Heidegger says, is the outermost horizon of our being: everything
					we can do or see or think takes place within this horizon. We cannot see beyond
					it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidegger’s technical vocabulary is famously difficult to understand, but this
					is largely because he is attempting to explore complex philosophical questions
					in a concrete or non-abstract way; he wants to relate to our actual experience.
					To say that “the furthest horizon of our being is death” is to say something
					about what it is like to live a human life, and it captures some idea of what we
					are in a way that many philosophical definitions&mdash;“featherless biped” or
					“political animal”, for example&mdash;overlook.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"We should raise anew the question of the meaning of being."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Martin Heidegger</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-767" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Living authentically</h2></div><p class="calibre14">It is to Heidegger that we owe the philosophical distinction between authentic
					and inauthentic existence. Most of the time we are wrapped up in various ongoing
					projects, and forget about death. But in seeing our life purely in terms of the
					projects in which we are engaged, we miss a more fundamental dimension of our
					existence, and to that extent, Heidegger says, we are existing inauthentically.
					When we become aware of death as the ultimate limit of our possibilities, we
					start to reach a deeper understanding of what it means to exist.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a good friend dies, we may look at our own lives and realize
					that the various projects which absorb us from day to day feel meaningless, and
					that there is a deeper dimension to life that is missing. And so we may find
					ourselves changing our priorities and projecting ourselves toward different
					futures.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-768"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000290.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">All being</span> is a “being-towards-death”,

					this deeply on our own being. In order to ask questions about human existence,
					we must use the richer, deeper language of poetry, which engages us in a way
					that goes far beyond the mere exchange of information.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidegger was one of the 20th century’s most influential philosophers. His
					early attempt to analyze what it means to be human, and how one might live an
					authentic life, inspired philosophers such as Sartre, Levinas, and Gadamer, and
					contributed to the birth of existentialism. His later, more poetic, thinking has
					also had a powerful influence on ecological philosophers, who believe it offers
					a way of thinking about what it means to be a human being within a world under

				“hermeneutics.” Derived from the Greek word <i class="calibre12">hermeneuo</i>, meaning “interpret”, this is the study of how humans
				interpret the world.</p><p class="calibre13">Gadamer studied philosophy under Martin Heidegger, who said that the task of
				philosophy is to interpret our existence. This interpretation is always a process of
				deepening our understanding by starting from what we already know. The process is
				similar to how we might interpret a poem. We start by reading it carefully in the
				light of our present understanding. If we come to a line that seems strange or
				particularly striking, we might need to reach for a deeper level of understanding.
				As we interpret individual lines, our sense of the poem as a whole might begin to
				change; and as our sense of the poem as a whole changes, so might our understanding
				of individual lines. This is known as the “hermeneutic circle.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidegger’s approach to philosophy moved in this circular fashion, and this was
				the approach that Gadamer later explored in his book <i class="calibre12">Truth
					and Method</i>. Gadamer goes on to point out that our understanding is
				always from the point of view of a particular point in history. Our prejudices and
				beliefs, the kinds of questions that we think are worth asking, and the kinds of
				answers with which we are satisfied are all the product of our history. We cannot
				stand outside of history and culture, so we can never reach an absolutely objective
				perspective.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;But these prejudices should not be seen as a bad thing. They are, after all, our
				starting point, and our current understanding and sense of meaning are based upon
				these prejudices and biases. Even if it were possible to get rid of all our
				prejudices, we would not find that we would then see things clearly. Without any
				given framework for interpretation, we would not be able to see anything at
				all.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-788"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000054.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-789"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">When viewing historical</span> objects we should

					reveal our own cultural norms and prejudices, leading us to broaden and deepen
					our understanding of our own lives in the present. For instance, if I pick up a
					book by Plato, and read it carefully, I might find not only that I am deepening
					my understanding of Plato, but also that my own prejudices and biases become
					clear, and perhaps begin to shift. Not only am I reading Plato, but Plato is

							questions the very idea of scientific method.</p></div><p class="intro">We often think that science works by “proving” truths about the
				world. We might imagine that a good scientific theory is one that we can prove
				conclusively to be true. The philosopher Karl Popper, however, insists that this is
				not the case. Instead, he says that what makes a theory scientific is that it is
				capable of being falsified, or being shown to be wrong by experience.</p><p class="calibre13">Popper is interested in the method by which science finds out about the world.
				Science depends on experiment and experience, and if we want to do science well, we
				need to pay close attention to what philosopher David Hume called the “regularities”
				of nature&mdash;the fact that events unfold in the world in particular patterns and
				sequences that can be systematically explored. Science, in other words, is
				empirical, or based on experience, and to understand how it works we need to
				understand how experience in general leads to knowledge.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following statement: “If you drop a tennis ball from a second-floor
				window, it will fall to the ground.” Leaving aside any chance events (such as the
				ball being snatched away by a passing eagle), we can be fairly sure that this claim
				is a reasonable one. It would be a strange person who said, “Hold on, are you sure
				it will fall to the ground?” But how do we know that this is what will happen when
				we drop the tennis ball? What kind of knowledge is this?</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is that we know it will fall because that is what it always does.
				Leaving aside chance events, no-one has ever found that a tennis ball hovers or
				rises upward when it is released. We know it falls to the ground because experience
				has shown us that this will happen. And not only can we be sure that the ball will
				fall to the ground, we can also be sure about how it will fall to the ground. For
				example, if we know the force of gravity, and how high the window is above the
				ground, we can calculate the speed at which the ball will fall. Nothing about the
				event is even remotely mysterious.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the question remains: can we be certain that the next time we drop
				the ball it will fall to the ground? No matter how often we conduct the experiment,
				and no matter how confident we become about its outcome, we can never prove that the
				result will be the same in the future.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-795"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000366.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-796"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000342.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Black swans</span> were first encountered by

					problem of induction, and it was first recognized by Hume in the 18th century.
					So what is inductive reasoning?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction is the process of moving from a set of observed facts about the
					world to more general conclusions about the world. We expect that if we drop the
					ball it will fall to the ground because, at least according to Hume, we are
					generalizing from innumerable experiences of similar occasions on which we have
					found things like balls to fall to the ground when we release them.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-798" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Deductive reasoning</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Another form of reasoning, which philosophers contrast with induction, is
					deductive reasoning. While induction moves from the particular case to the
					general, deduction moves from the general case to the particular. For instance,
					a piece of deductive reasoning might start from two premises, such as: “If it is
					an apple, then it is a fruit (since all apples are fruit)” and “This is an
					apple.” Given the nature of these premises, the statement “This is an apple”
					leads inescapably to the conclusion “It is a fruit.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophers like to simplify deductive arguments by writing them out in
					notation. So the general form of the argument above would be “If P then Q; since
					P, therefore Q.” In our example, “P” stands for “It is an apple”, and “Q” stands
					for “It is a fruit.” Given the starting points “If P then Q” and “P”, then the
					conclusion “Q” is necessary, or unavoidably true. Another example would be: “If
					it is raining, the cat will meow (since all cats meow in the rain). It is
					raining, therefore the cat will meow.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;All arguments of this kind are considered by philosophers to be valid
					arguments, because their conclusions follow inevitably from their premises.
					However, the fact that an argument is valid does not mean that its conclusions
					are true. For example, the argument “If it is a cat, then it is banana-flavored;
					this is a cat, therefore it is banana-flavored” is valid, because it follows a
					valid form. But most people would agree that the conclusion is false. And a
					closer look shows that there is a problem, from an empirical perspective, with
					the premise “If it is a cat, then it is banana-flavored”, because cats, in our
					world at least, are not banana-flavored. In other words, because the premise is
					untrue, even though the argument itself is valid, the conclusion is also untrue.
					Other worlds can be imagined in which cats are in fact banana-flavored, and for
					this reason the statement that cats are not banana-flavored is said to be
					contingently true, rather than logically or necessarily true, which would demand
					that it be true in all possible worlds. Nevertheless, arguments that are valid
					and have true premises are called “sound” arguments. The banana-flavored cat
					argument, as we have seen, is valid but not sound&mdash;whereas the argument about
					apples and fruit is both valid and sound.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre21">"Every solution to a problem creates new unsolved problems."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Karl Popper</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-799"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000319.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">An example</span> of the problem of induction

					they reach are only as good as the data that is fed into them. Deductive
					reasoning has an important role to play in the sciences, but on its own, it
					cannot say anything about the world. It can only say “If this is the case, then
					that is the case.” And if we want to use such arguments in the sciences, we
					still have to rely on induction for our premises, and so science is lumbered
					with the problem of induction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, according to Popper, we cannot prove our theories to be true.
					Moreover, what makes a theory scientific is not that it can be proved at all,
					but that it can be tested against reality and shown to be potentially false. In
					other words, a falsifiable theory is not a theory that is false, but one that
					can only be shown to be false by observation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Theories that are untestable (for example, that we each have an invisible
					spirit guide, or that God created the universe) are not part of the natural
					sciences. This does not mean that they are worthless, only that they are not the
					kinds of theories that the sciences deal with.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of falsifiability does not mean we are unjustified in having a belief
					in theories that cannot be falsified. Beliefs that stand up to repeated testing,
					and that resist our attempts at falsification, can be taken to be reliable. But
					even the best theories are always open to the possibility that a new result will
					show them to be false.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Popper’s work has not been without its critics. Some scientists claim that he
					presents an idealized view of how they go about their work, and that science is
					practiced very differently from how Popper suggests. Nevertheless, his idea of
					falsifiability is still used in distinguishing between scientific and
					non-scientific claims, and Popper remains perhaps the most important philosopher
					of science of the 20th century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-801"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000296.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Experiments can show</span> that certain

				all the way back to Saint Paul’s letter to the Corinthians in which he asks his
				followers to be “fools for Christ’s sake.” Throughout the Middle Ages this idea was
				developed into the popular cultural figure of the saint or sage who was foolish or
				lacked intelligence, but who was morally good or pure.</p><p class="calibre13">In his book <i class="calibre12">Minima Moralia</i>, the German
				philosopher Theodor Adorno calls into question this long tradition. He is suspicious
				of attempts to (as he puts it) “absolve and beatify the blockhead”, and wants to
				make the case that goodness involves our entire being, both our feeling and our
				understanding.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the idea of the holy fool, Adorno says, is that it divides us
				into different parts, and in doing so makes us incapable of acting judiciously at
				all. In reality, judgement is measured by the extent to which we manage to make
				feeling and understanding cohere. Adorno’s view implies that evil acts are not just
				failures of feeling, but also failures of intelligence and understanding.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorno was a member of the Frankfurt School, a group of philosophers who were
				interested in the development of capitalism. He condemned forms of mass
				communication such as television and radio, claiming that these have led to the
				erosion of both intelligence and feeling, and to a decline in the ability to make
				moral choices and judgements. If we choose to switch off our brains by watching
				blockbuster movies (insofar as we can choose at all, given the prevailing cultural
				conditions in which we live), for Adorno, this is a moral choice. Popular culture,
				he believes, not only makes us stupid; it also makes us unable to act
				morally.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-806"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000214.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-807" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Essential emotions</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Adorno believes that the opposite error to that of imagining that there might
					be such a thing as a holy fool is imagining that we can judge on intelligence
					alone, without emotion. This might happen in a court of law; judges have been
					known to instruct the jury to put all emotion to one side, so that they can come
					to a cool and measured decision. But in Adorno’s view, we can no more make wise
					judgements by abandoning emotion than we can by abandoning intelligence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last trace of emotion has been driven out of our thinking, Adorno
					writes, we are left with nothing to think about, and the idea that intelligence
					might benefit “from the decay of the emotions” is simply mistaken. For this
					reason Adorno believes that the sciences, which are a form of knowledge that do
					not make reference to our emotions, have, like popular culture, had a
					dehumanizing effect upon us.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, it may in fact be the sciences that will ultimately demonstrate
					the wisdom of Adorno’s central concerns about the severing of intelligence and
					feeling. Since the 1990s, scientists such as Antonio Damasio have studied

				makes us so distinct from all other types of being has been one of the main
				preoccupations of philosophers. Their approach to the question assumes that there is
				such a thing as human nature, or an essence of what it is to be human. It also tends
				to assume that this human nature is fixed across time and space. In other words, it
				assumes that there is a universal essence of what it is to be human, and that this
				essence can be found in every single human that has ever existed, or will ever
				exist. According to this view, all human beings, regardless of their circumstances,
				possess the same fundamental qualities and are guided by the same basic values. For
				Sartre, however, thinking about human nature in this way risks missing what is most
				important about human beings, and that is our freedom.</p><p class="calibre13">To clarify what he means by this, Sartre gives the following illustration. He asks
				us to imagine a paper-knife&mdash;the kind of knife that might be used to open an
				envelope. This knife has been made by a craftsman who has had the idea of creating
				such a tool, and who had a clear understanding of what is required of a paper-knife.
				It needs to be sharp enough to cut through paper, but not so sharp as to be
				dangerous. It needs to be easy to wield, made of an appropriate substance&mdash;metal,
				bamboo, or wood, perhaps, but not butter, wax, or feathers&mdash;and fashioned to function
				efficiently. Sartre says that it is inconceivable for a paper-knife to exist without
				its maker knowing what it is going to be used for. Therefore the essence of a
				paper-knife&mdash;or all of the things that make it a paper-knife and not a steak knife or
				a paper aeroplane&mdash;comes before the existence of any particular paper-knife.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans, of course, are not paper-knives. For Sartre, there is no preordained plan
				that makes us the kind of beings that we are. We are not made for any particular
				purpose. We exist, but not because of our purpose or essence like a paper-knife
				does; our existence precedes our essence.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-813"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000114.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-814" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Defining ourselves</h2></div><p class="calibre14">This is where we begin to see the connection between Sartre’s claim that
					“existence precedes essence” and his atheism. Sartre points out that religious
					approaches to the question of human nature often work by means of an analogy
					with human craftsmanship&mdash;that human nature in the mind of God is analogous to
					the nature of the paper-knife in the mind of the craftsman who makes it. Even
					many non-religious theories of human nature, Sartre claims, still have their
					roots in religious ways of thinking, because they continue to insist that
					essence comes before existence, or that we are made for a specific purpose. In
					claiming that existence comes before essence, Sartre is setting out a position
					that he believes is more consistent with his atheism. There is no universal,
					fixed human nature, he declares, because no God exists who could ordain such a
					nature.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Sartre is relying on a very specific definition of human nature,
					identifying the nature of something with its purpose. He is rejecting the
					concept of what philosophers call teleology in human nature&mdash;that it is something
					that we can think about in terms of the purpose of human existence.
					Nevertheless, there is a sense in which Sartre is offering a theory of human
					nature, by claiming that we are the kinds of beings who are compelled to assign
					a purpose to our lives. With no divine power to prescribe that purpose, we must
					define ourselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining ourselves, however, is not just a matter of being able to say what we
					are as human beings. Instead, it is a matter of shaping ourselves into whatever
					kind of being we choose to become. This is what makes us, at root, different
					from all the other kinds of being in the world&mdash;we can become whatever we choose
					to make of ourselves. A rock is simply a rock; a cauliflower is simply a
					cauliflower; and a mouse is simply a mouse. But human beings possess the ability
					to actively shape themselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Sartre’s philosophy releases us from the constraint of a human nature
					that is preordained, it is also one of freedom. We are free to choose how to
					shape ourselves, although we do have to accept some limitations. No amount of
					willing myself to grow wings, for example, will ever cause that to happen. But
					even within the range of realistic choices we have, we often find that we are
					constrained and simply make decisions based upon habit, or because of the way in
					which we have become accustomed to see ourselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sartre wants us to break free of habitual ways of thinking, telling us to face
					up to the implications of living in a world in which nothing is preordained. To
					avoid falling into unconscious patterns of behavior, he believes we must
					continually face up to choices about how to act.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-815"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000088.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The use or purpose</span> of a tool, such as a

					life ought to be. If I decide to become a philosopher, then I am not just
					deciding for myself. I am implicitly saying that being a philosopher is a
					worthwhile activity. This means that freedom is the greatest responsibility of
					all. We are not just responsible for the impact that our choices have upon
					ourselves, but also for their impact on the whole of mankind. And, with no
					external principles or rules to justify our actions, we have no excuses to hide
					behind for the choices that we make. For this reason, Sartre declares that we
					are “condemned to be free.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sartre’s philosophy of linking freedom with responsibility has been labelled
					as pessimistic, but he refutes that charge. Indeed, he states that it is the
					most optimistic philosophy possible, because despite bearing responsibility for
					the impact of our actions upon others, we are able to choose to exercise sole
					control over how we fashion our world and ourselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sartre’s ideas were particularly influential on the writings of his companion
					and fellow philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, but they also had a marked impact on
					French cultural and daily life. Young people especially were thrilled by his
					call to use their freedom to fashion their existence. He inspired them to
					challenge the traditionalist, authoritarian attitudes that prevailed in France
					in the 1950s and 1960s. Sartre is cited as a key influence on the streets
					protests in Paris in May 1968, which helped to bring down the conservative
					government and herald a more liberal climate throughout France.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Engagement with political issues was an important part of Sartre’s life. His
					constantly changing affiliations, as well as his perpetual movement between
					politics, philosophy, and literature, are themselves perhaps testament to a life
					lived in the light of the idea that existence precedes essence.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they

					bodily experience. In his most important book, <i class="calibre12">The
						Phenomenology of Perception</i>, Merleau-Ponty explores this idea and
					comes to the conclusion that the mind and body are not separate entities&mdash;a
					thought that contradicts a long philosophical tradition championed by Descartes.
					For Merleau-Ponty, we have to see that thought and perception are embodied, and
					that the world, consciousness, and the body are all part of a single system. And
					his alternative to the disembodied mind proposed by Descartes is what he calls
					the body-subject. In other words, Merleau-Ponty rejects the dualist’s view that
					the world is made of two separate entities, called mind and matter.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-832" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cognitive science</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Because he was interested in seeing the world anew, Merleau-Ponty took an
					interest in cases of abnormal experience. For example, he believed that the
					phantom limb phenomenon (in which an amuptee “feels” his missing limb) shows
					that the body cannot simply be a machine. If it were, the body would no longer
					acknowledge the missing part&mdash;but it still exists for the subject because the
					limb has always been bound up with the subject’s will. In other words, the body
					is never “just” a body&mdash;it is always a “lived” body.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Merleau-Ponty’s focus on the role of the body in experience, and his insights
					into the nature of the mind as fundamentally embodied, have led to a revival of
					interest in his work among cognitive scientists. Many recent developments in
					cognitive science seem to bear out his idea that, once we break with our
					familiar acceptance of the world, experience is very strange indeed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-833"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000275.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">MRI scans of the brain</span> provide doctors

				measure of what we take to be human&mdash;both in philosophy and in society at large&mdash;has
				been a peculiarly male view. Some philosophers, such as Aristotle, have been
				explicit in equating full humanity with maleness. Others have not said as much, but
				have nevertheless taken maleness as the standard against which humanity is to be
				judged. It is for this reason that de Beauvoir says that the Self (or “I”) of
				philosophical knowledge is by default male, and his binary pair&mdash;the female&mdash;is
				therefore something else, which she calls the Other. The Self is active and knowing,
				whereas the Other is all that the Self rejects: passivity, voicelessness, and
				powerlessness.</p><p class="calibre13">De Beauvoir is also concerned with the way that women are judged to be equal only
				insofar as they are like men. Even those who have written on behalf of the equality
				of women, she says, have done so by arguing that equality means that women can be
				and do the same as men. She claims that this idea is mistaken, because it ignores
				the fact that women and men are different. De Beauvoir’s philosophical background
				was in phenomenology, the study of how things appear to our experience. This view
				maintains that each of us constructs the world from within the frame of our own
				consciousness; we constitute things and meanings from the stream of our experiences.
				Consequently de Beauvoir maintains that the relationship that we have to our own
				bodies, to others, and to the world, as well as to philosophy itself, is strongly
				influenced by whether we are male or female.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-838"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000199.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"Representation of the world is the work of men; they describe it from their

					asks us to separate the biological entity (the bodily form which females are
					born into) from femininity, which is a social construct. Since any construct is
					open to change and interpretion, this means that there are many ways of “being a
					woman”; there is room for existential choice. In the introduction to <i class="calibre12">The Second Sex</i> de Beauvoir notes society’s
					awareness of this fluidity: “We are exhorted to be women, remain women, become
					women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a
					woman.” She later states the position explicitly: “One is not born but becomes a
					woman.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;De Beauvoir says that women must free themselves both from the idea that they
					must be like men, and from the passivity that society has induced in them.

				relationship between objects and verbal signifiers, but about knowing what to say
				and when to say it. It is, he says in his 1968 essay <i class="calibre12">Ontological Relativity</i>, a social art.</p><p class="calibre13">Quine suggests the following thought experiment. Imagine that we come across some
				people&mdash;perhaps natives of another country&mdash;who speak a language we do not share. We
				are sitting with a group of these people when a rabbit appears, and one of the
				natives says “gavagai.” We wonder if there can be a connection between the event&mdash;the
				appearance of the rabbit&mdash;and the fact that the native says “gavagai.” As time goes
				on, we note that every time a rabbit appears, somebody says “gavagai”, so we
				conclude that “gavagai” can be reliably translated as rabbit. But, Quine insists, we
				are wrong. “Gavagai” could mean all manner of things. It could mean “oh, look,
				dinner!” for example, or it could mean “behold, a fluffy creature!”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to determine the meaning of “gavagai”, we could try another method.
				We could point to other fluffy creatures (or other things on the dinner menu) and
				see if our utterance of “gavagai” met with assent or dissent. But even if we were to
				reach a position where, in each and every occasion on which “gavagai” was uttered,
				we ourselves would utter the word “rabbit”, we still could not be sure that this was
				an appropriate translation. “Gavagai” could mean “set of rabbit parts” or
				“wood-living rabbit” or “rabbit or hare”; it might even refer to a short prayer that
				must be uttered whenever a rabbit is seen.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-845"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000099.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-846" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Unsettled language</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In attempting to establish the precise meaning of this mysterious “gavagai”,
					therefore, we might think that the solution would be to learn the language of
					our informants thoroughly, so that we could be absolutely sure of the contexts
					in which the word was spoken. But this would only result in multiplying the
					problem, because we could not be sure that the other words we found ourselves
					using to explain the meaning of “gavagai” were themselves accurate
					translations.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quine refers to this problem as the “indeterminacy of translation”, and it has
					unsettling implications. It suggests that ultimately words do not have meanings.
					The sense of somebody uttering “gavagai” (or, for that matter, “rabbit”), and of
					this utterance being meaningful comes not from some mysterious link between
					words and things, but from the patterns of our behavior, and the fact that we
					have learned to participate in language as a social art.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-847"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000068.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">No word has a fixed meaning,</span> according

				British philosopher Isaiah Berlin in his famous essay <i class="calibre12">Two
					Concepts of Liberty</i>, written in 1958. Here he makes a distinction
				between what he calls “positive” and “negative” freedom. Although he is not the
				first to draw this distinction, he does so with great originality, and uses it to
				expose apparent inconsistencies in our everyday notion of freedom.</p><p class="calibre13">For Berlin, “negative” freedom is what he calls our “fundamental sense” of
				freedom. This kind of freedom is freedom from external obstacles: I am free because
				I am not chained to a rock, because I am not in prison, and so on. This is freedom
				from something else. But Berlin points out that when we talk about freedom, we
				usually mean something more subtle than this. Freedom is also a matter of
				self-determination, of being a person with hopes, and intentions, and purposes that
				are one’s own. This “positive” freedom is about being in control of one’s own
				destiny. After all, I am not free just because all the doors of my house are
				unlocked. And this positive freedom is not exclusively personal, because
				self-determination can also be desired at the level of the group or of the
				state.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Berlin, the problem is that these two forms of freedom are often in conflict.
				Think, for example, of the freedom that comes from the discipline of learning how to
				play the tuba. As a beginner, I can do little more than struggle with my own
				inability to play&mdash;but eventually I can play with a kind of liberated gusto. Or think
				of the fact that people frequently exercise their “positive” freedom by voting for a
				particular government, knowing that their “negative” freedom will be restricted when
				that government comes to power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-852"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000406.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-853" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The goals of life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Berlin points to another problem. Who is to say what a suitable goal of
					“positive” freedom should be? Authoritarian or totalitarian regimes often have
					an inflexible view of the purpose of human life, and so restrict “negative”
					freedoms to maximize their idea of human happiness. Indeed, political oppression
					frequently arises from an abstract idea of what the good life is, followed by
					state intervention to make that idea a reality.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Berlin’s response to this is twofold. First, it is important to recognize that
					the various freedoms we may desire will always be in conflict, for there is no
					such thing as “the goal of life”&mdash;only the goals of particular individuals. This
					fact, he claims, is obscured by philosophers who look for a universal basis for
					morality, but confuse “right action” with the purpose of life itself. Second, we
					need to keep alive the fundamental sense of freedom as an absence of “bullying
					and domination”, so that we do not find our ideals turning into chains for
					ourselves and for others.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-854"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000381.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Soviet propaganda</span> often depicted

				with the concept of “deep ecology”&mdash;a term coined in 1973 by the Norwegian
				philosopher and environmental campaigner, Arne Naess. He uses the term to stress his
				belief that we must first recognize we are part of nature, and not separate from it,
				if we are to avoid environmental catastrophe. But the notion of thinking like a
				mountain goes back to 1949, when it was expressed by American ecologist Aldo Leopold
				in <i class="calibre12">The Sand County Almanac</i>.</p><p class="calibre13">Working as a forester in New Mexico in the early part of the 20th century, Leopold
				shot a female wolf on the mountainside. “We reached the old wolf in time to watch a
				fierce green fire dying in her eyes,” he wrote. “I realized then, and have known
				ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes&mdash;something known only to
				her and to the mountain.” It was from this experience that Leopold came to the idea
				that we should think like a mountain, recognizing not just our needs or those of our
				fellow humans, but those of the entire natural world. He implies that often we miss
				the broader implications of our actions, only considering the immediate benefits to
				ourselves. To “think like a mountain” means identifying with the wider environment
				and being aware of its role in our lives.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-859"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000303.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"The thinking for the future has to be loyal to nature."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Arne Naess</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-860" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Harmonizing with nature</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Naess takes up Leopold’s idea by proposing his “deep ecology.” He states that
					we only protect our environment by undergoing the kind of transformation of
					which Leopold writes. Naess urges us to move toward seeing ourselves as part of
					the whole biosphere. Instead of viewing the world with a kind of detachment, we
					must find our place in nature, by acknowledging the intrinsic value of all
					elements of the world we inhabit.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Naess introduces the “ecological self”, a sense of self that is rooted in an
					awareness of our relationship to a “larger community of all living beings.” He
					claims that broadening our identification with the world to include wolves,
					frogs, spiders, and perhaps even mountains, leads to a more joyful and
					meaningful life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Naess’s “deep ecology” has had a powerful effect on environmental philosophy
					and on the development of environmental activism. For those of us who live in
					cities, it may seem hard or even impossible to connect with an “ecological
					self.” Nevertheless, it may be possible. As the Zen master Robert Aitken Roshi
					wrote in 1984, “When one thinks like a mountain, one thinks also like the black

				meaning of life. But the French philosopher and novelist Albert Camus thought that
				philosophy should recognize instead that life is inherently meaningless. While at
				first this seems a depressing view, Camus believes that only by embracing this idea
				are we capable of living as fully as possible.</p><p class="calibre13">Camus’ idea appears in his essay <i class="calibre12">The Myth of
					Sisyphus</i>. Sisyphus was a Greek king who fell out of favor with the
				gods, and so was sentenced to a terrible fate in the Underworld. His task was to
				roll an enormous rock to the top of a hill, only to watch it roll back to the
				bottom. Sisyphus then had to trudge down the hill to begin the task again, repeating
				this for all eternity. Camus was fascinated by this myth, because it seemed to him
				to encapsulate something of the meaninglessness and absurdity of our lives. He sees
				life as an endless struggle to perform tasks that are essentially
				meaningless.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Camus recognizes that much of what we do certainly seems meaningful, but what he
				is suggesting is quite subtle. On the one hand, we are conscious beings who cannot
				help living our lives as if they are meaningful. On the other hand, these meanings
				do not reside out there in the universe; they reside only in our minds. The universe
				as a whole has no meaning and no purpose; it just is. But because, unlike other
				living things, we have consciousness, we are the kinds of beings who find meaning
				and purpose everywhere.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-866"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000227.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-867" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Recognizing the absurd</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The absurd, for Camus, is the feeling that we have when we recognize that the
					meanings we give to life do not exist beyond our own consciousness. It is the
					result of a contradiction between our own sense of life’s meaning, and our
					knowledge that nevertheless the universe as a whole is meaningless.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Camus explores what it might mean to live in the light of this contradiction.
					He claims that it is only once we can accept the fact that life is meaningless
					and absurd that we are in a position to live fully. In embracing the absurd, our
					lives become a constant revolt against the meaninglessness of the universe, and
					we can live freely.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea was further developed by the philosopher Thomas Nagel, who said that
					the absurdity of life lies in the nature of consciousness, because however
					seriously we take life, we always know that there is some perspective from which
					this seriousness can be questioned.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-868"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000074.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Sisyphus was</span> condemned eternally to

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-144"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">The closing decades of the 20th century were notable for accelerating
				advances in technology and the subsequent improvement in communications of all
				kinds. The increasing power of the mass media, especially television, since the end
				of World War II had fuelled a rise in popular culture with its associated
				antiestablishment ideals, and this in turn was prompting political and social
				change. From the 1960s onward, the old order was being questioned in Europe and the
				US, and dissent gathered momentum in Eastern Europe.</p><p class="calibre13">By the 1980s, relations between the East and West were thawing, and the Cold War
				was coming to a close; the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 offered hope for the new
				decade. But the 1990s was a period of ethnic and religious unrest, culminating in
				the US declaring a “War on Terror” at the start of the new millennium.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-871"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000131.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-872" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Elitist philosophies</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Culture in the West went through similarly significant changes. The gap
					between popular and “high” culture widened after the 1960s, as the intellectual
					avant-garde often decided to disregard public taste. Philosophy followed a
					similarly elitist path, particularly after the death of Jean-Paul Sartre, whose
					Marxist existentialism&mdash;beloved of 1960s intellectuals&mdash;now had less of an
					audience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continental philosophy was dominated in the 1970s and 80s by structuralism, a
					movement that grew from literature-based French philosophy. Central to this
					movement was the notion of “deconstructing” texts and revealing them to be
					inherently unstable, with many contradictory meanings. The theory’s principal
					proponents&mdash;French theorists Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Michel
					Foucault&mdash;linked their textual analyses with left-wing politics, while the
					analyst Jacques Lacan gave structuralism a psychoanalytic perspective. Their
					ideas were soon taken up by a generation of writers and artists working under
					the banner of “postmodernism”, which rejected all possibility of a single,
					objective truth, viewpoint, or narrative.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Structuralism’s contribution to philosophy was not enthusiastically received
					by philosophers in the English-speaking world, who viewed the work at best with
					suspicion, and largely with derision. Within a philosophical tradition of
					linguistic analysis, continental structuralism seemed ultimately
					simplistic&mdash;although it was often written in impenetrable prose that belied its
					literary roots.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The squabbles of philosophers did not inspire the popular culture of the time.
					This may have been because postmodernism was largely incomprehensible to the
					general public. Their most common experience of it was postmodern art, which was
					highly conceptual and accompanied by knowing references by an intellectual
					elite. It seemed to deliberately exclude any possibility of mass appreciation,
					and became seen as an abstract philosophy only enjoyed by professional academics
					and artists, and out of touch with the world most people lived in. The public,
					as well as businesses and governments, wanted more down-to-earth guidance from
					philosophy.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-873" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A more practical approach</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Though postmodern philosophy may not have found favor with the majority of the
					general public, some philosophers of the period chose to focus on more pressing
					social, political, and ethical questions that had more relevance to people’s
					everyday lives. Thinkers in postcolonial Africa such as Frantz Fanon began to
					examine race, identity, and the problems that were inherent in any struggle for
					liberation. Later thinkers, such as Henry Odera Oruka, would begin to amass a
					new history of African philosophy, questioning the rules governing philosophy
					itself, and what it should include.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing in the tradition of Simone de Beauvoir’s existential feminist
					philosophy, French philosophers such as Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray added a
					postmodern perspective to feminism, but other thinkers on both sides of the
					Atlantic left postmodernism completely to one side. Some, such as American
					philosopher John Rawls and Germany’s Jürgen Habermas, returned to examining
					important everyday concepts in depth, such as justice and communication.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The more practical approach to philosophy in the 21st century has led to a
					renewed public interest in the subject. There is no way of predicting what
					direction it will take, but philosophy is certain to continue to provide the
					world with thought-provoking ideas.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				literary critic Roland Barthes is <i class="calibre12">A Lover’s
					Discourse</i>. As the French title, <i class="calibre12">Fragments
					d’un discours amoureux,</i> suggests, this is a book told in fragments
				and snapshots, somewhat like the essay <i class="calibre12">One-Way
					Street</i> by the German philosopher Walter Benjamin. <i class="calibre12">A Lover’s Discourse</i> is not so much a book of philosophy
				as it is a love story; but it is a love story without any real story. There are no
				characters, and there is nothing in the way of a plot. There are only the
				reflections of a lover in what Barthes calls “extreme solitude.”</p><p class="calibre13">At the very beginning of the book, Barthes makes clear that a plot is not
				possible, because the solitary thoughts of a lover come in outbursts that are often
				contradictory and lack any clear order. As a lover, Barthes suggests, I might even
				find myself plotting against myself. The lover is somebody who might be
				affectionately described as having “lost the plot.” So instead of using a plot, or
				narrative, Barthes arranges his book like an extraordinary encyclopaedia of
				contradictory and disordered outbursts, any of which might serve as the point the
				reader might suddenly exclaim, “That’s so true! I recognize that scene…”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-876"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000269.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-877" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The language of love</h2></div><p class="calibre14">It is in this context that Barthes suggests “language is a skin.” Language, at
					least the language of the lover, is not something that simply talks about the
					world in a neutral fashion, but it is something that, as Barthes says, “trembles
					with desire.” Barthes writes of how “I rub my language against the other. It is
					as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words.” Even
					if I write cool, detached philosophy about love, Barthes claims, there is buried
					in my philosophical coolness a secret address to a particular person, an object
					of my desire, even if this somebody is “a phantom or a creature still to
					come.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Barthes gives an example of this secret address (although not, it should be
					said, in the context of a particularly detached philosophical discussion) from
					Plato’s dialogue, <i class="calibre12">The Symposium</i>. This is an
					account of a discussion on the subject of love that takes place in the house of
					the poet Agathon. A statesman called Alcibiades turns up to the discussion both
					late and drunk, and sits down on a couch with Agathon and the philosopher
					Socrates. The drunken speech he gives is full of praise for Socrates, but it is
					Agathon that Alcibiades desires; it is against Agathon, so to speak, that
					Alcibiades’ language is rubbing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the language that we use when talking of other things? Is only the
					lover’s language a skin that trembles with hidden desire, or is this also true
					of other types of language? Barthes does not tell us, leaving us to consider the
					idea for ourselves.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre21">"Every lover is mad."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Roland Barthes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-878"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000049.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The lover’s language</span> is like a skin,

					novelties. Over time, however, anomalous results can accumulate until a crisis
					point is reached. Following the crisis, if a new theory has been formulated,
					there is a shift in the paradigm, and the new theoretical framework replaces the
					old. Eventually this framework is taken for granted, and normal science
					resumes&mdash;until further anomalies arise. An example of such a shift was the
					shattering of the classical view of space and time following the confirmation of

				of justice in terms of what he calls “justice as fairness.” His approach falls into
				the tradition known as social contract theory, which sees the rule of law as a form
				of contract that individuals enter into because it yields benefits that exceed what
				they can attain individually. Rawls’ version of this theory involves a thought
				experiment in which people are made ignorant of their place in society, or placed in
				what he calls the “original position” in which the social contract is made. From
				this Rawls establishes principles of justice on which, he claims, all rational
				beings should agree.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-889"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000208.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-890" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The original position</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Imagine that a group of strangers is marooned on a desert island, and that,
					after giving up hope of being rescued, they decide to start a new society from
					scratch. Each of the survivors wants to further their own interests, but each
					also sees that they can only do so by working together in some way&mdash;in other
					words, by forming a social contract. The question is: how do they go about
					establishing the principles of justice? What rules do they lay down? If they are
					interested in a truly rational and impartial justice, then there are countless
					rules that have to be discounted immediately. For example, the rule “If your
					name is John, you must always eat last”, is neither rational nor impartial, even
					if it may be to your advantage if your name is “John.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a position, says Rawls, what we need to do is cast a “veil of
					ignorance” over all the facts of our lives, such as who we are, and where we
					were born, and then ask what kind of rules it would be best for us to live by.
					Rawls’ point is that the only rules that could rationally be agreed on by all
					parties are ones that genuinely honor impartiality, and don’t, for example, take
					race, class, creed, natural talent, or disability into account. In other words,
					if I don’t know what my place in society will be, rational self-interest compels

				coined by the Austrian-born philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein to describe the nature
				of language. For Wittgenstein, language is a “form of life”, because the way we use

				Jean-François Lyotard’s book <i class="calibre12">The Postmodern Condition: A
					Report on Knowledge</i>. The book was originally written for the Council
				of Universities in Quebec, Canada, and the use of the term “postmodern” in its title
				is significant. Although Lyotard did not invent the term, which had been used by
				various art critics since the 1870s, his book was responsible for broadening its
				range and increasing its popularity. His use of the word in the title of this book
				is often said to mark the beginning of postmodern thought.</p><p class="calibre13">The term “postmodernism” has since been used in so many different ways that it is
				now hard to know exactly what it means, but Lyotard’s definition is very clear.
				Postmodernism, he writes, is a matter of “incredulity towards meta-narratives.”
				Meta-narratives are overarching, single stories that attempt to sum up the whole of
				human history, or that attempt to put all of our knowledge into a single framework.
				Marxism (the view that history can be seen as a series of struggles between social
				classes) is an example of a meta-narrative. Another is the idea that humanity’s
				story is one of progress toward deeper knowledge and social justice, brought about
				by greater scientific understanding.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-904"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000137.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-905" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Externalized knowledge</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Our incredulity toward these meta- narratives implies a new scepticism.
					Lyotard suggests that this is due to a shift in the way we have related to
					knowledge since World War II, and to the huge change in the technologies we use
					to deal with it. Computers have fundamentally transformed our attitudes, as
					knowledge has become information that can be stored in databases, moved to and
					fro, and bought and sold. This is what Lyotard calls the “mercantilization” of
					knowledge.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This has several implications. The first, Lyotard points out, is that
					knowledge is becoming externalized. It is no longer something that helps toward
					the development of minds; something that might be able to transform us.
					Knowledge is also becoming disconnected from questions of truth. It is being
					judged not in terms of how true it is, but in terms of how well it serves
					certain ends. When we cease to ask questions about knowledge such as “is it
					true?” and start asking questions such as “how can this be sold?”, knowledge
					becomes a commodity. Lyotard is concerned that once this happens, private
					corporations may begin to seek to control the flow of knowledge, and decide who
					can access what types of knowledge, and when.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-906"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000109.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">When knowledge</span> becomes data it is no

				psychoanalytic study of colonialism and racism, <i class="calibre12">Black Skin,
					White Masks</i>, in 1952. In the book Fanon attempts to explore the
				psychological and social legacy of colonialism among non-white communities around
				the world.</p><p class="calibre13">In saying that “for the black man, there is only one destiny”, and this destiny is
				white, Fanon is saying at least two things. First, he says that “the black man wants
				to be like the white man”; that is, the aspirations of many colonized peoples have
				been formed by the dominant colonial culture. European colonial cultures tended to
				equate “blackness” with impurity, which shaped the self-view of those who were
				subject to colonial rule, so that they came to see the color of their skin as a sign
				of inferiority.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way out of this predicament seems to be an aspiration to achieve a “white
				existence”; but this will always fail, because the fact of having dark skin will
				always mean that one will fail to be accepted as white. For Fanon, this aspiration
				to achieve “a white existence” not only fails to address racism and inequality, but
				it also masks or even condones these things by implying that there is an “unarguable
				superiority” to white existence.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Fanon is saying something more complex. It might be thought
				that, given this tendency to aspire to a kind of “white existence”, the solution
				would be to argue for an independent view of what it means to be black. Yet this,
				too, is subject to all kinds of problems. Elsewhere in his book, Fanon writes that
				“the black man’s soul is a white man’s artefact.” In other words, the idea of what
				it means to be black is the creation of patterns of fundamentally racist European
				thought.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Fanon is, in part, responding to what was known in France as the <i class="calibre12">négritude</i> (or “blackness”) movement. This was a
				movement of French and French-speaking black writers from the 1930s who wanted to
				reject the racism and colonialism of mainstream French culture, and argued for an
				independent, shared black culture. But Fanon believes that this idea of <i class="calibre12">négritude</i> is one that fails to truly address the
				problems of racism that it seeks to overcome, because the way that it thinks about
				“blackness” simply repeats the fantasies of mainstream white culture.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-911"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000034.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"There is a fact: White men consider themselves superior to black men."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Frantz Fanon</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-912" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Human rights</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In one sense, Fanon believes that the solution can only come when we move
					beyond racial thinking; that if we remain trapped within the idea of race we
					cannot ever address these injustices. “I find myself in the world and I
					recognize that I have one right alone,” Fanon writes at the end of his book;
					“that of demanding human behavior from the other.” Fanon’s thought has been of
					widespread importance in anti-colonial and anti-racist movements, and has

					that time a French colony. He left Martinique to fight with the Free French
					Forces in World War II, after which he studied both medicine and psychiatry in
					Lyon, France. He also attended lectures on literature and philosophy, including
					those given by the philosopher Merleau-Ponty. The young Fanon had thought of
					himself as French, and the racism he encountered on first entering France
					surprised him. It played a huge role in shaping his philosophy, and one year
					after qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, he published his book <i class="calibre12">Black Skin, White Masks</i>.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1953 Fanon moved to Algeria where he worked as a hospital psychiatrist.
					After two years of hearing his patients’ tales of the torture they
					endured during the 1954&ndash;62 Algerian War of Independence, he resigned his
					government-funded post, moved to Tunisia, and began working for the Algerian
					independence movement. In the late 1950s, he developed leukemia. During his
					illness, he wrote his final book, <i class="calibre12">The Wretched of the
						Earth</i>, arguing for a different world. It was published in the
					year of his death with a preface by Jean-Paul Sartre, a friend who had first
					influenced Fanon, then been influenced by him.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1952</b><i class="calibre12"> Black Skin, White Masks</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1959</b><i class="calibre12"> A Dying Colonialism</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1961</b><i class="calibre12"> The Wretched of the Earth</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1969</b><i class="calibre12"> Toward the African Revolution (collected short

					Sciences</i> by French philosopher Michel Foucault. To understand what
				Foucault means by this, we need to know what he means by archaeology, and why he
				thinks that we should apply it to the history of thought.</p><p class="calibre13">Foucault is interested in how our discourse&mdash;the way in which we talk and think
				about things&mdash;is formed by a set of largely unconscious rules that arise out of the
				historical conditions in which we find ourselves. What we take to be the “common
				sense” background to how we think and talk about the world is in fact shaped by
				these rules and these conditions. However, the rules and conditions change over
				time, and consequently so do our discourses. For this reason, an “archaeology” is
				needed to unearth both the limits and the conditions of how people thought and
				talked about the world in previous ages. We cannot take concepts that we use in our
				present context (for example, the concept of “human nature”) and assume that they
				are somehow eternal, and that all we need is a “history of ideas” to trace their
				genealogy. For Foucault, it is simply wrong to assume that our current ideas can be
				usefully applied to any previous point in history. The ways in which we use the
				words “man”, “mankind”, and “human nature”, Foucault believes, are examples of
				this.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of this idea lie firmly in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who turned
				philosophy on its head by abandoning the old question “Why is the world the way it
				is?” and asking “Why do we see the world the way we do?” We take our idea of what it
				is to be human as fundamental and unchanging, but it is in fact only a recent
				invention. Foucault locates the beginning of our particular idea of “man” at the
				beginning of the 19th century, around the time of the birth of the natural sciences.
				This idea of “man” is, Foucault considers, paradoxical: we see ourselves both as
				objects in the world, and so as objects of study, and as subjects who experience and
				study the world&mdash;strange creatures that look in two directions at once.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-917"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000367.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-918" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The human self-image</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Foucault suggests that not only is this idea of “man” an invention of recent

					interfaces, and when philosophers informed by cognitive science, such as Daniel
					Dennett and Dan Wegner, are questioning the very nature of subjectivity, it is
					hard not to feel that, even if the face in the sand is not about to be erased,

				maintains that rhetorical claims by governments are not by themselves sufficient for
				us to reach the truth about political power. Governments may speak the language of
				“facts” as a way of justifying their actions, but unless their claims are supported
				by evidence, then they are only illusions, and the actions to which they lead lack
				justification. If we are to understand more clearly how states operate, it is
				necessary to move beyond the battle between rival forms of rhetoric, and instead to
				look at history, at institutional structures, at official policy documents, and so
				forth.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-924"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000270.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre21">"States are not moral agents; people are."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Noam Chomsky</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-925" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Ethics and universality</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Chomsky’s ethical analyses are based on what he calls the “principle of
					universality.” At root, this principle is relatively simple. It says that at the
					very least we should apply to ourselves the same standards that we apply to
					others. This is a principle that Chomsky claims has always been central to any
					responsible system of ethics. The central psychological insight here is that we
					are fond of using ethical language as a way of protesting about others, but that
					we are less inclined to pass judgment on ourselves. Nevertheless, if we claim to
					uphold any set of ethical or moral standards, and if we wish to be consistent,
					then we must apply to others the standards we apply to ourselves. In terms of
					government, this means that we must analyze our political actions rigorously,
					instead of allowing ourselves to be blinded by rhetoric.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a moral and an intellectual imperative. For Chomsky, these are
					closely related. He points out that if anyone making a moral claim is also
					violating universality, then their claim cannot be taken seriously and should be
					rejected.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to cut through the rhetoric and examine political morality in a
					rigorous fashion, it seems that universality is a necessary starting point. Some
					of Chomsky’s specific claims about the nature of global power have caused
					considerable controversy, but this does not invalidate his central insight. For
					if we wish to call his specific claims into question, then we should do so in
					the light of universality and of all the available evidence. If his claims turn
					out to be false, then they should be rejected or modified; but if they turn out
					to be true, then they should be acted upon.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-926"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000239.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Uncle Sam</span>, the personification of the

				heart of our everyday communications. Somebody says or does something, and we say,
				“Why did you do that?” or “Why did you say that?” We continually ask for
				justifications, which is why Habermas talks about “communicative” reason. Reason,
				for him, is not about discovering abstract truths, but about the need we have to
				justify ourselves to others.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-931"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000143.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-932" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Creating a public sphere</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the 1960s and 1970s, Habermas concluded that there was a link between
					communicative reason and what he calls the “public sphere.” Up until the 18th
					century, he states, European culture was largely “representational”, meaning
					that the ruling classes sought to “represent” themselves to their subjects with
					displays of power that required no justification, such as impressive pageants or
					grand architectural projects. But in the 18th century, a variety of public
					spaces emerged that were outside state control, including literary salons and
					coffee houses. These were places where individuals could gather to engage in
					conversation or reasoned debate. This growth of the public sphere led to
					increased opportunities to question the authority of representational state
					culture. The public sphere became a “third space”, a buffer between the private
					space of our immediate friends and family, and the space occupied by state
					control.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By establishing a public sphere, we also open up more opportunities for
					recognizing that we have interests in common with other private
					individuals&mdash;interests that the state may fail to serve. This can lead to
					questioning the actions of the state. Habermas believes that the growth of the
					public sphere helped to trigger the French Revolution in 1789.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the public sphere, from the 18th century onward, has led to a
					growth of democratically elected political institutions, independent courts, and
					bills of rights. But Habermas believes that many of these brakes on the
					arbitrary use of power are now under threat. Newspapers, for example, can offer
					opportunities for reasoned dialogue between private individuals, but if the
					press is controlled by large corporations, such opportunities may diminish.
					Informed debate on issues of substance is replaced with celebrity gossip, and we
					are transformed from critical, rational agents into mindless consumers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-933"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000170.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Coffee houses became</span> a focus of social

					calls “aporias.” The word “aporia” comes from the Ancient Greek, where it means
					something like “contradiction”, “puzzle”, or “impasse.” For Derrida, all written
					texts have such gaps, holes, and contradictions and his method of deconstruction
					is a way of reading texts while looking out for these puzzles and impasses. In
					exploring these contradictions as they appear in different texts, Derrida aims
					to broaden our understanding of what texts are and what they do, and to show the
					complexity that lies behind even the most apparently simple works.
					Deconstruction is a way of reading texts to bring these hidden paradoxes and
					contradictions out into the open. This is not, however, just a matter of how we
					read philosophy and literature; there are much broader implications to Derrida’s
					approach that bring into question the relationship between language, thought,
					and even ethics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it would help to introduce an important technical term from
					Derrida’s vocabulary: “<i class="calibre12">différance</i>.”
					This may look like a typographical error&mdash;and indeed, when the term <i class="calibre12">différance</i> first entered the French dictionary, the
					story goes that even Derrida’s mother sternly said to him, “But Jacques, that is
					not how you spell it!” But in fact <i class="calibre12">différance</i>
					is a word that Derrida coined himself to point to a curious aspect of
					language.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;“<i class="calibre12">Différance</i>” (with an “a”) is a play both
					on the French “<i class="calibre12">différence</i>” (with an “e”),
					meaning “to differ”, and the French “<i class="calibre12">deférrer</i>” meaning “to defer.” To understand how this word works, it
					would be useful to consider how this deferring and differing might actually take
					place in practice. Let us start with deferring. Imagine that I say “The cat…”,
					then I add, “that my friend saw….” After a pause, I say, “in the garden was
					black and white…”, and so on. The precise meaning of the word “cat” as I am
					using it is continually deferred, or put off, as more information is given. If I
					had been cut off after saying “The cat…” and had not mentioned my friend or the
					garden, the meaning of “cat” would have been different. The more I add to what I
					say, in other words, the more the meaning of what I have already said is
					revised. Meaning is deferred in language.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something else going on as well. The meaning of “cat”, Derrida
					believes, cannot be considered as something that rests in the relationship
					between my words and actual things in the world. The word takes its meaning from
					its position in a whole system of language. So when I say “cat”, this is
					meaningful not because of some mysterious link between the word and an actual
					cat, but because this term differs from, for example, “dog” or “lion” or
					“zebra.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these two ideas of deferring and differing say something quite
					strange about language in general. On the one hand, the meaning of anything we
					say is ultimately always deferred, because it depends on what else we say; and
					the meaning of that, in turn, depends on what else we say, and so on. And on the
					other hand, the meaning of any particular term we use depends on all the things
					that we don’t mean. So meaning is not self-contained within the text
					itself.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-940"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000062.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A typesetter</span> can check plates of type

					language that we become aware of thanks to writing. Since ancient Greek times,
					philosophers have been suspicious of written language. In Plato’s dialogue, the
						<i class="calibre12">Phaedrus</i>, Socrates tells a legend about
					the invention of writing, and says that writing provides only “the appearance of
					wisdom” and not its reality. Writing, when philosophers have thought about it at
					all, has tended to be seen simply as a pale reflection of the spoken word; the
					latter has been taken as the primary means of communication. Derrida wants to
					reverse this; according to him, the written word shows us something about
					language that the spoken word does not.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional emphasis on speech as a means of transmitting philosophical
					ideas has fooled us all, Derrida believes, into thinking that we have immediate
					access to meaning. We think that meaning is about “presence”&mdash;when we speak with
					another person, we imagine that they make their thoughts “present” for us, and
					that we are doing the same for them. If there is any confusion, we ask the other
					person to clarify. And if there are any puzzles, or aporias, we either ask for
					clarification, or these simply slide past us without our noticing. This leads us
					to think that meaning in general is about presence&mdash;to think, for example, that
					the real meaning of “cat” can be found in the presence of a cat on my
					lap.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we deal with a written text, we are freed from this naïve belief in
					presence. Without the author there to make their excuses and explain for us, we
					start to notice the complexities and the puzzles and the impasses. All of a
					sudden, language begins to look a little more complicated.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"We think only in signs."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jacques Derrida</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-943" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Questioning meaning</h2></div><p class="calibre14">When Derrida says that there is nothing outside of the text, he does not mean
					that all that matters is the world of books, that somehow the world “of flesh
					and bone” does not matter. Nor is he trying to play down the importance of any
					social concerns that might lie behind the text. So what exactly is he
					saying?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Derrida is suggesting that if we take seriously the idea that meaning
					is a matter of <i class="calibre12">différance</i>, of differing and
					of deferring, then if we want to engage with the question of how we ought think
					about the world, we must always keep alive to the fact that meaning is never as
					straightforward as we think it is, and that this meaning is always open to being
					examined by deconstruction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Derrida is suggesting that in our thinking, our writing, and our
					speaking, we are always implicated in all manner of political, historical, and
					ethical questions that we may not even recognize or acknowledge. For this
					reason, some philosophers have suggested that deconstruction is essentially an
					ethical practice. In reading a text deconstructively, we call into question the
					claims that it is making, and we open up difficult ethical issues that may have
					remained hidden. Certainly in his later life, Derrida turned his attention to
					some of the very real ethical puzzles and contradictions that are raised by
					ideas such as “hospitality” and “forgiveness.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-944"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000400.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Derrida’s own thesis</span> that there is

					completely present in the text, it is perhaps not surprising that Derrida’s work
					can often be difficult. Michel Foucault, one of Derrida’s contemporaries,
					attacked Derrida’s thinking for being wilfully obscure; he protested that often
					it was impossible to say exactly what Derrida’s thesis actually was. The
					latter’s response to this, perhaps, might be to say that the idea of having a
					thesis is itself based on the idea of “presence” that he is attempting to call
					into question. This may seem like dodging the issue; but if we take Derrida’s
					idea seriously, then we have to admit that the idea that there is nothing
					outside of the text is itself not outside of the text. To take this idea
					seriously, then, is to treat it sceptically, to deconstruct it, and to explore
					the puzzles, impasses, and contradictions that&mdash;according to Derrida himself&mdash;lurk
					within it.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre21">"I never give in to the temptation to be difficult just for the sake of

				souls or describe what a soul is like, many of us nonetheless hold firmly to the
				belief that, somewhere deep down, we each have such a thing. Not only this, we might
				claim that this thing is the fundamental self (“me”) and, at the same time, is
				somehow connected directly with the truth or reality.</p><p class="calibre13">The tendency to picture ourselves as possessing a kind of “double”&mdash;a soul or a
				deep self that “uses Reality’s own language”&mdash;is explored by American philosopher
				Richard Rorty in the introduction to his book, <i class="calibre12">The
					Consequences of Pragmatism</i> (1982). Rorty argues that, to the extent
				that we have such a thing at all, a soul is a human invention; it is something that
				we have put there ourselves.</p><div id="calibre_link-951" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Knowledge as a mirror</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Rorty was a philosopher who worked within the American tradition of
					pragmatism. In considering a statement, most philosophical traditions ask “is
					this true?”, in the sense of: “does this correctly represent the way things
					are?.” But pragmatists consider statements in quite a different way, asking
					instead: “what are the practical implications of accepting this as true?”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rorty’s first major book, <i class="calibre12">Philosophy and the Mirror of
						Nature</i>, published in 1979, was an attempt to argue against the
					idea that knowledge is a matter of correctly representing the world, like some
					kind of mental mirror. Rorty argues that this view of knowledge cannot be
					upheld, for two reasons. First, we assume that our experience of the world is
					directly “given” to us&mdash;we assume that what we experience is the raw data of how
					the world is. Second, we assume that once this raw data has been collected, our
					reason (or some other faculty of mind) then starts to work on it, reconstructing
					how this knowledge fits together as a whole, and mirroring what is in the
					world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rorty follows the philosopher Wilfrid Sellars in claiming that the idea of
					experience as “given” is a myth. We cannot ever access anything like raw data&mdash;it
					is not possible for us to experience a dog, for instance, outside of thought or
					language. We only become aware of something through conceptualizing it, and our
					concepts are learned through language. Our perceptions are therefore
					inextricably tangled up with the habitual ways that we use language to divide up
					the world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rorty suggests that knowledge is not so much a way of mirroring nature as “a
					matter of conversation and social practice.” When we decide what counts as
					knowledge, our judgement rests not on how strongly a “fact” correlates to the
					world, so much as whether it is something “that society lets us say.” What we
					can and cannot count as knowledge is therefore limited by the social contexts
					that we live in, by our histories, and by what those around us will allow us to
					claim. “Truth,” said Rorty, “is what your contemporaries let you get away with
					saying.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"Philosophy makes progress not by becoming more rigorous but by becoming

					Rorty is aware that there are some disturbing implications here, especially in
					questions of ethics. Imagine, for instance, that I kidnap my neighbor’s
					pet hamster and subject it to all manner of cruel tortures, simply for the fun
					of hearing it squeak. We might all agree that doing such a thing to the poor
					hamster (or, for that matter, doing such a thing to my neighbor) is a morally
					blameable act. We might claim that there is something absolutely and
					fundamentally wrong about doing such a thing to another living being; and we
					might all agree that we ought not let other people get away with such
					things.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we look at the reasons that we give for saying that this is a morally
					blameable act, things become interesting. For example, imagine that you are
					asked by a particularly awkward moral philosopher why it is wrong to treat
					hamsters (or horses, or humans) in this way. At first you might suggest all
					manner of reasons. But philosophy being what it is, and moral philosophers being
					the kinds of beings they are, you might find that for every reason you can think
					of, your philosopher friend has a counter-reason or leads you into some kind of
					contradiction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, in fact, precisely what the philosopher Socrates did in ancient
					Athens. Socrates wanted to find out what concepts such as “goodness” and
					“justice” really were, so he questioned people who used these concepts, to find
					out whether they really knew what these things were. As the dialogues of Plato
					show, most of the people Socrates talked to were surprisingly unclear about what
					it was they were actually talking about, despite their earlier conviction that
					they fully grasped the relevant concepts. In the same way, after an hour or two
					of being interrogated by a modern-day Socrates about how to treat hamsters, you
					might blurt out in frustration the following sentence: “But I just know, in my
					heart of hearts, that it is wrong!”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-955"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000247.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Using children as soldiers</span> may seem

					immediately clear what exactly we mean. To examine the idea more closely, we can
					break it down into three parts. First, it seems that when we say “I know, in my
					heart of hearts, that it is wrong”, we are speaking as if there is something out
					there in the world that is “wrongness”, and that this thing is knowable. Or, as
					some philosophers put it, we are speaking as if there is an essence of
					“wrongness” to which this particular instance of wrongness corresponds.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by saying that we just “know” in our heart of hearts, we imply that
					this mysterious entity&mdash;our “heart of hearts”&mdash;is a thing that, for reasons
					unknown, has a particular grasp of truth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we seem to be speaking as if there is a straightforward relationship
					between our “heart of hearts” and this “wrongness” that lies out there in the
					world, such that if we know something in our heart of hearts, we can have access
					to an absolutely certain kind of knowledge. In other words, this is just another
					version of the idea that knowledge is a way of mirroring the world. And this,
					Rorty believes, is unacceptable.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre21">"If we can rely on one another, we need not rely on anything else."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Richard Rorty</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-957" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A world without absolutes</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In order for his beliefs to be consistent, Rorty has to give up on the idea of
					fundamental moral truths. There can be no absolute right or wrong if knowledge
					is “what society lets us say.” Rorty recognizes that this is a difficult thing
					to accept. But is it necessary to believe that on doing something morally wrong
					you are betraying something deep within you? Must you believe that there is
					“some truth about life, or some absolute moral law, that you are violating” in
					order to maintain even a shred of human decency? Rorty thinks not. He maintains
					that we are finite beings, whose existence is limited to a short time on Earth,
					and none of us have a hotline to some deeper, more fundamental moral truth.
					However, this does not imply that the problems of life have either gone away or
					ceased to matter. These problems are still with us, and in the absence of
					absolute moral laws we are thrown back upon our own resources. We are left,
					Rorty writes, with “our loyalty to other human beings clinging together against
					the dark.” There is no absolute sense of rightness and wrongness to be
					discovered. So we simply have to hold on to our hopes and loyalties, and
					continue to participate in involved conversations in which we talk about these
					difficult issues.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Rorty is saying, these things are enough: the humility that comes
					from recognizing that there is no absolute standard of truth; the solidarity we
					have with others; and our hopes that we may be able to contribute to, and to
					bequeath to those who come after us, a world that is worth living in.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-958"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000222.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">We do not need to believe</span> in an

				For Cixous, a thread that runs through centuries of thought is our tendency to group

				head/heart. Cixous claims that these pairs of elements are always by implication
				ranked hierarchically, underpinned by a tendency to see one element as being

				regarded as one of the leading voices in French feminism. Nevertheless, the question
				of whether, or in what way, Kristeva is a feminist thinker has been subject to
				considerable debate. Part of the reason for this is that for Kristeva herself, the
				very notion of feminism is problematic. Feminism has arisen out of the conflict
				women have had with the structures that are associated with male dominance or power.
				Because of these roots, Kristeva warns, feminism carries with it some of the same
				male-centered presuppositions that it is seeking to question.</p><p class="calibre13">If the feminist movement is to realize its goals fully, Kristeva believes that it
				is essential for it to be more self-critical. She warns that by seeking to fight
				what she calls the “power principle” of a male-dominated world, feminism is at risk
				of adopting yet another form of this principle. Kristeva is convinced that for any
				movement to be successful in achieving true emancipation, it must constantly
				question its relationship to power and established social systems&mdash;and, if necessary
				“renounce belief in its own identity.” If the feminist movement fails to take these
				steps, Kristeva fears that it is in serious danger of developing into little more
				than an additional strand in the ongoing game of power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-972"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000111.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Margaret Thatcher</span>, like many women who have

				into villages and recorded conversations with people who were considered wise by

					branch of philosophy.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1029"><b class="calibre16">Essence </b>The essence of a thing is that which is distinctive about it and makes it what
					it is. For instance, the essence of a unicorn is that it is a horse with a

					died, Plato died, Aristotle died, and each other individual man who was born
					more than 130 years ago has died. Therefore all men are mortal.” Induction does
					not necessarily yield results that are true, so whether it is genuinely a

						<b class="calibre16">analysis</b> of the language in which they have
					been expressed.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1042"><b class="calibre16">Logic </b>The branch of philosophy that makes a study of rational <b class="calibre16">argument</b> itself&mdash;its terms, concepts, rules, and methods.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1043"><b class="calibre16">Logical positivism </b>The view that the only <b class="calibre16">empirical statements</b>

					itself.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1046"><b class="calibre16">Metaphysics </b>The branch of philosophy concerned with the ultimate nature of what exists. It
					questions the natural world “from outside”, and its questions cannot be answered
					by science.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1047"><b class="calibre16">Methodology </b>The study of methods of enquiry and <b class="calibre16">argument</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1048"><b class="calibre16">Monism </b>A view of something as formed by a single element; for example, the view that

					natural world.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1051"><b class="calibre16">Necessary </b>Must be the case. The opposite is <b class="calibre16">contingent</b>.
					Hume believed that necessary connections existed only in <b class="calibre16">logic</b>, not in the real world, a view that has been upheld by
					many philosophers since.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1052"><b class="calibre16">Necessary and sufficient conditions </b>For X to be a husband it is a necessary condition for X to be married.
					However, this is not a sufficient condition&mdash;for what if X is female? A
					sufficient condition for X to be a husband is that X is both a man and married.
					One of the commonest forms of error in thinking is to mistake necessary
					conditions for sufficient conditions.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1053"><b class="calibre16">Noncontradictory </b>Statements are considered noncontradictory if their <b class="calibre16">truth-values</b> are independent of one another.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1054"><b class="calibre16">Noumenon </b>The unknowable reality behind what presents itself to human consciousness, the
					latter being known as <b class="calibre16">phenomenon</b>. A thing as it
					is in itself, independently of being experienced, is said to be the noumenon.
					“The noumenal” has therefore become a term for the ultimate nature of
					reality.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1055"><b class="calibre16">Numinous </b>Anything regarded as mysterious and awesome, bearing intimations from outside
					the natural realm. Not to be confused with the noumenal; see <b class="calibre16">noumenon</b> above.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1056"><b class="calibre16">Ontology </b>A branch of philosophy that asks what actually exists, as distinct from the
					nature of our knowledge of it, which is covered by the branch of <b class="calibre16">epistemology</b>. Ontology and epistemology taken
					together constitute the central tradition of philosophy.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1057"><b class="calibre16">Phenomenology </b>An approach to philosophy which investigates objects of experience (known as
						<b class="calibre16">phenomena</b>) only to the extent that they
					manifest themselves in our consciousness, without making any assumptions about
					their nature as independent things.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1058"><b class="calibre16">Phenomenon </b>An experience that is immediately present. If I look at an object, the object
					as experienced by me is a phenomenon. Immanuel Kant distinguished this from the
					object as it is in itself, independently of being experienced: this he called
					the <b class="calibre16">noumenon</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1059"><b class="calibre16">Philosophy </b>Literally, “the love of wisdom.” The word is widely used for any sustained
						<b class="calibre16">rational</b> reflection about general
					principles that has the aim of achieving a deeper understanding. Philosophy
					provides training in the disciplined <b class="calibre16">analysis</b>
					and clarification of <b class="calibre16">arguments</b>, theories,
					methods, and utterances of all kinds, and the concepts of which they make use.
					Traditionally, its ultimate aim has been to attain a better understanding of the
					world, though in the 20th century a good deal of philosophy became devoted to
					attaining a better understanding of its own procedures.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1060"><b class="calibre16">Philosophy of religion </b>The branch of philosophy that looks at human belief systems and the real or

					the practice of scientific endeavor.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1062"><b class="calibre16">Political philosophy </b>The branch of philosophy that questions the nature and methods of the state
					and deals with such subjects as justice, law, social hierarchies, political
					power, and constitutions.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1063"><b class="calibre16">Postmodernism </b>A viewpoint that holds a general distrust of theories, narratives, and
					ideologies that attempt to put all knowledge into a single framework.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1064"><b class="calibre16">Pragmatism </b>A theory of truth. It holds that a statement is true if it does all the jobs
					required of it: accurately describes a situation; prompts us to anticipate
					experience correctly; fits in with already well-attested statements; and so
					on.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1065"><b class="calibre16">Premise </b>The starting point of an <b class="calibre16">argument</b>. Any
					argument has to start from at least one premise, and therefore does not prove
					its own premises. A <b class="calibre16">valid</b> argument proves that
					its conclusions follow from its premises&mdash;but this is not the same as proving
					that its conclusions are true, which is something no argument can do.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1066"><b class="calibre16">Presupposition </b>Something taken for granted but not expressed. All utterances have
					presuppositions, and these may be conscious or unconscious. If a presupposition
					is mistaken, an utterance based on it may also be mistaken, though the mistake
					may not evident in the utterance itself. The study of philosophy teaches us to
					become more aware of presuppositions.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1067"><b class="calibre16">Primary and secondary qualities </b>John Locke divided the <b class="calibre16">properties</b> of a
					physical object into those that are possessed by the object independently of
					being experienced, such as its location, dimensions, velocity, mass, and so on
					(which he called primary qualities), and those that involve the interaction of
					an experiencing observer, such as the object’s color and taste (which he called
					secondary qualities).</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1068"><b class="calibre16">Property </b>In philosophy this word is commonly used to mean a characteristic; for example
					“fur or hair is a defining property of a mammal.” See also <b class="calibre16">primary and secondary qualities</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1069"><b class="calibre16">Rational </b>Based on, or according to, the principles of reason or <b class="calibre16">logic</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1070"><b class="calibre16">Proposition </b>The content of a statement that confirms or denies whether something is the
					case, and is capable of being true or false.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1071"><b class="calibre16">Rationalism </b>The view that we can gain knowledge of the world through the use of reason,
					without relying on sense-perception, which is regarded by rationalists as
					unreliable. The opposite view is known as <b class="calibre16">empiricism</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1072"><b class="calibre16">Scepticism </b>The view that it is impossible for us to know anything for certain.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1073"><b class="calibre16">Semantics </b>The study of meanings in linguistic expressions.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1074"><b class="calibre16">Semiotics </b>The study of signs and symbols, in particular their relationships with the
					things they are meant to signify.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1075"><b class="calibre16">Social contract </b>An implicit agreement among members of a society to cooperate in order to
					achieve goals that benefit the whole group, sometimes at the expense of
					individuals within it.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1076"><b class="calibre16">Solipsism </b>The view that only the existence of the self can be known.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1077"><b class="calibre16">Sophist </b>Someone whose aim in <b class="calibre16">argument</b> is not to seek
					the truth but to win the argument. In ancient Greece, young men aspiring to
					public life were taught by sophists to learn the various methods of winning
					arguments.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1078"><b class="calibre16">Synthesis </b>Seeking a deeper understanding of something by putting the pieces together.
					The opposite is <b class="calibre16">analysis</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1079"><b class="calibre16">Synthetic statement </b>A statement that has to be set against facts outside itself for its truth to

						statement</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1080"><b class="calibre16">Teleology </b>A study of ends or goals. A teleological explanation is one that explains
					something in terms of the ends that it serves.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1081"><b class="calibre16">Theology </b>Enquiry into scholarly and intellectual questions concerning the nature of
					God. Philosophy, by contrast, does not assume the existence of God, though some
					philosophers have attempted to prove his existence.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1082"><b class="calibre16">Thing-in-itself </b>Another term for a <b class="calibre16">noumenon</b>, from the German
						<em class="calibre12">Ding-an-sich</em>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1083"><b class="calibre16">Transcendental </b>Outside the world of sense experience. Someone who believes that <b class="calibre16">ethics</b> are transcendental believes that ethics have
					their source outside the <b class="calibre16">empirical world</b>.
					Thoroughgoing <b class="calibre16">empiricists</b> do not believe that

						<b class="calibre16">existentialists</b>.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1084"><b class="calibre16">Truth-value </b>Either of two values, namely true or false, that can be applied to a
					statement.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1085"><b class="calibre16">Universal </b>A concept of general application, like “red” or “woman.” It has been disputed
					whether universals have an existence of their own. Does “redness” exist, or are
					there only individual red objects? In the Middle Ages, philosophers who believed
					that “redness” had a real existence were called “realists”, while philosophers
					who maintained that it was no more than a word were called “nominalists.”</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1086"><b class="calibre16">Universalism </b>The belief that we should apply to ourselves the same standards and values

					defines “good” in terms of pleasure and the absence of pain.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1088"><b class="calibre16">Validity </b>An <b class="calibre16">argument</b> is valid if its conclusion
					follows from its <b class="calibre16">premises</b>. This does not
					necessarily mean that the conclusion is true: it may be false if one of the
					premises is false, though the argument itself is still valid.</p><p class="glossentry1" id="calibre_link-1089"><b class="calibre16">Verifiability </b>A statement or set of statements can be verified if it can be proved to be
					true by looking at empirical evidence. <b class="calibre16">Logical
						positivists</b> believed that the only <b class="calibre16">empirical statements</b> that were meaningful were those that were
