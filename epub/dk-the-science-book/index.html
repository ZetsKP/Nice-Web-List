			how the Universe works that goes back to the earliest civilizations. Driven by human
			curiosity, it has relied on reasoning, observation, and experiment. The best known of
			the ancient Greek philosophers, Aristotle, wrote widely on scientific subjects and laid
			foundations for much of the work that has followed. He was a good observer of nature,
			but he relied entirely on thought and argument, and did no experiments. As a result, he
			got a number of things wrong. He asserted that big objects fall faster than little ones,
			for example, and that if one object had twice the weight of another, it would fall twice
			as fast. Although this is mistaken, no one doubted it until the Italian astronomer
			Galileo Galilei disproved the idea in 1590. While it may seem obvious today that a good
			scientist must rely on empirical evidence, this was not always apparent.</p><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h"></h2></div><div id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The scientific method</h2></div><p class="intro">A logical system for the scientific process was first put forward by the
					English philosopher Francis Bacon in the early 17th century. Building on the
					work of the Arab scientist Alhazen 600 years earlier, and soon to be reinforced
					by the French philosopher René Descartes, Bacon’s scientific method requires
					scientists to make observations, form a theory to explain what is going on, and
					then carry out an experiment to see whether the theory works. If it seems to be
					true, then the results may be sent out for peer review, in which people working
					in the same or a similar field are invited to pick holes in the argument, and so
					falsify the theory, or to repeat the experiment to make sure that the results
					are correct.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a testable hypothesis or a prediction is always useful. English
					astronomer Edmond Halley, observing the comet of 1682, realized that it was
					similar to comets reported in 1531 and 1607, and suggested that all three were
					the same object, in orbit round the Sun. He predicted that it would return in
					1758, and he was right, though only just &ndash; it was spotted on 25 December. Today,
					the comet is known as Halley’s Comet. Since astronomers are rarely able to
					perform experiments, evidence can come only from observation.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments may test a theory, or be purely speculative. When the New
					Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford watched his students fire alpha
					particles at gold leaf in a search for small deflections, he suggested putting
					the detector beside the source, and to their astonishment some of the alpha
					particles bounced back off the paper-thin foil. Rutherford said it was as though
					an artillery shell had bounced back off tissue paper &ndash; and this led him to a new
					idea about the structure of the atom.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;An experiment is all the more compelling if the scientist, while proposing a
					new mechanism or theory, can make a prediction about the outcome. If the
					experiment produces the predicted result, the scientist then has supporting
					evidence for the theory. Even so, science can never prove that a theory is
					correct; as the 20th-century philosopher of science Karl Popper pointed out, it
					can only disprove things. Every experiment that gives predicted answers is
					supporting evidence, but one experiment that fails may bring an entire theory
					crashing down.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the centuries, long-held concepts such as a geocentric Universe, the four
					bodily humours, the fire-element phlogiston, and a mysterious medium called
					aether have all been disproved and replaced with new theories. These in turn are
					only theories, and may yet be disproved, although in many cases this is unlikely
					given the evidence in their support.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre10">"All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is
						to discover them."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Galileo Galilei</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Progression of ideas</h2></div><p class="intro">Science rarely proceeds in simple, logical steps. Discoveries may be made
					simultaneously by scientists working independently, but almost every advance
					depends in some measure on previous work and theories. One reason for building
					the vast apparatus known as the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, was to search for
					the Higgs particle, whose existence was predicted 40 years earlier, in 1964.
					That prediction rested on decades of theoretical work on the structure of the
					atom, going back to Rutherford and the work of Danish physicist Niels Bohr in
					the 1920s, which depended on the discovery of the electron in 1897, which in
					turn depended on the discovery of cathode rays in 1869. Those could not have
					been found without the vacuum pump and, in 1799, the invention of the battery &ndash;
					and so the chain goes back through decades and centuries. The great English
					physicist Isaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing
					on the shoulders of giants.” He meant primarily Galileo, but he had probably
					also seen a copy of Alhazen’s <i class="calibre11">Optics</i>.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-147"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000389.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The first scientists</h2></div><p class="intro">The first philosophers with a scientific outlook were active in the ancient
					Greek world during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Thales of Miletus predicted an
					eclipse of the Sun in 585 BCE; Pythagoras set up a mathematical school in what
					is now southern Italy 50 years later, and Xenophanes, after finding sea shells
					on a mountain, reasoned that the whole Earth must at one time have been covered
					by sea.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sicily in the 4th century BCE, Empedocles asserted that earth, air, fire,
					and water are the “fourfold roots of everything”. He also took his followers up
					to the volcanic crater of Mt Etna and jumped in, apparently to show he was
					immortal &ndash; and as a result we remember him to this day.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Star-gazers</h2></div><p class="intro">Meanwhile, in India, China, and the Mediterranean, people tried to make sense
					of the movements of the heavenly bodies. They made star maps &ndash; partly as
					navigational aids &ndash; and named stars and groups of stars. They also noted that a

					Western world, the year 1543 saw the publication of two ground-breaking books.
					Belgian anatomist Andreas Vesalius produced <i class="calibre11">De Humani
						Corporis Fabrica</i>, which described his dissections of human
					corpses with exquisite illustrations. In the same year, Polish physician
					Nicolaus Copernicus published <i class="calibre11">De Revolutionibus Orbium
						Coelestium</i>, which stated firmly that the Sun is the centre of the
					Universe, overturning the Earth-centred model worked out by Ptolemy of
					Alexandria a millennium earlier.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1600, English physician William Gilbert published <i class="calibre11">De Magnete</i> in which he explained that compass needles point
					north because Earth itself is a magnet. He even argued that Earth’s core is made
					of iron. In 1623, another English physician, William Harvey, described for the
					first time how the heart acts as a pump and drives blood around the body,
					thereby quashing forever earlier theories that dated back 1,400 years to the
					Greco-Roman physician Galen. In the 1660s, Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle
					produced a string of books, including <i class="calibre11">The Sceptical
						Chymist</i>, in which he defined a chemical element. This marked the
					birth of chemistry as a science, as distinct from the mystical alchemy from
					which it arose.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Hooke, who worked for a time as Boyle’s assistant, produced the first
					scientific bestseller, <i class="calibre11">Micrographia</i>, in 1665.
					His superb fold-out illustrations of subjects such as a flea and the eye of a
					fly opened up a microscopic world no one had seen before. Then in 1687 came what
					many view as the most important science book of all time, Isaac Newton’s
						<i class="calibre11">Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
						Mathematica</i>, commonly known as the <i class="calibre11">Principia</i>. His laws of motion and principle of universal gravity

					oxygen in combustion, discrediting the old theory of phlogiston. Soon a host of
					new gases and their properties were being investigated. Thinking about the gases
					in the atmosphere led British meteorologist John Dalton to suggest that each
					element consisted of unique atoms, and propose the idea of atomic weights. Then
					German chemist August Kekulé developed the basis of molecular structure, while
					Russian inventor Dmitri Mendeleev laid out the first generally accepted periodic
					table of the elements.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The invention of the electric battery by Alessandro Volta in Italy in 1799
					opened up new fields of science, into which marched Danish physicist Hans
					Christian Ørsted and British contemporary Michael Faraday, discovering new
					elements and electromagnetism, which led to the invention of the electric motor.
					Meanwhile, the ideas of classical physics were applied to the atmosphere, the
					stars, the speed of light, and the nature of heat, which developed into the
					science of thermodynamics.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Geologists studying rock strata began to reconstruct Earth’s past.
					Palaeontology became fashionable as the remains of extinct creatures began to

					technical advances have enabled science to advance faster than ever before,
					leap-frogging ideas with increasing precision. Ever more powerful particle
					colliders revealed new fundamental units of matter. Stronger telescopes showed
					that the Universe is expanding, and started with a Big Bang. The idea of black
					holes began to take root. Dark matter and dark energy, whatever they were,
					seemed to fill the Universe, and astronomers began to discover new worlds &ndash;
					planets in orbit around distant stars, some of which may even harbour life.

				Following the invention of agriculture and writing, people had the time to devote to
				study and the means to pass the results of those studies on to the next generation.
				Early science was inspired by the wonder of the night sky. From the fourth
				millennium BCE, Sumerian priests studied the stars, recording their results on clay
				tablets. They did not leave records of their methods, but a tablet dating from 1800
				BCE shows knowledge of the properties of right-angled triangles.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-157"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000036.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Ancient Greece</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The ancient Greeks did not see science as a separate subject from philosophy,
					but the first figure whose work is recognizably scientific is probably Thales of
					Miletus, of whom Plato said that he spent so much time dreaming and looking at
					the stars that he once fell into a well. Possibly using data from earlier
					Babylonians, in 585 BCE, Thales predicted a solar eclipse, demonstrating the
					power of a scientific approach.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient Greece was not a single country, but rather a loose collection of city
					states. Miletus (now in Turkey) was the birthplace of several noted
					philosophers. Many other early Greek philosophers studied in Athens. Here,
					Aristotle was an astute observer, but he did not carry out experiments; he
					believed that, if he could bring together enough clever men, the truth would
					emerge. The engineer Archimedes, who lived at Syracuse on the island of Sicily,
					explored the properties of fluids. A new centre of learning developed at
					Alexandria, founded at the mouth of the Nile by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE.
					Here Eratosthenes measured the size of Earth, Ctesibius made accurate clocks,
					and Hero invented the steam engine. Meanwhile, the librarians in Alexandria
					collected the best books they could find to build up the best library in the
					world, which was burned down when Romans and Christians took over the
					city.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Science in Asia</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Science flourished independently in China. The Chinese invented gunpowder &ndash;
					and with it fireworks, rockets, and guns &ndash; and made bellows for working metal.
					They invented the first seismograph and the first compass. In 1054 CE, Chinese
					astronomers observed a supernova, which was identified as the Crab Nebula in
					1731.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most advanced technology in the first millennium CE, including the
					spinning wheel, was developed in India, and Chinese missions were sent to study
					Indian farming techniques. Indian mathematicians developed what we now call the
					“Arabic” number system, including negative numbers and zero, and gave
					definitions of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Golden Age of Islam</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In the middle of the 8th century, the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate moved the
					capital of its empire from Damascus to Baghdad. Guided by the Quranic slogan
					“The ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr”, Caliph Harun
					al-Rashid founded the House of Wisdom in his new capital, intending it to be a
					library and centre for research. Scholars collected books from the old Greek
					city states and India and translated them into Arabic. This is how many of the
					ancient texts would eventually reach the West, where they were largely unknown
					in the Middle Ages. By the middle of the 9th century, the library in Baghdad had
					grown to become a fine successor to the library at Alexandria.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those who were inspired by the House of Wisdom were several astronomers,
					notably al-Sufi, who built on the work of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. Astronomy was
					of practical use to Arab nomads for navigation, as they steered their camels
					across the desert at night. Alhazen, born in Basra and educated in Baghdad, was
					one of the first experimental scientists, and his book on optics has been
					likened in importance to the work of Isaac Newton. Arab alchemists devised
					distillation and other new techniques, and coined words such as alkali,
					aldehyde, and alcohol. Physician al-Razi introduced soap, distinguished for the
					first time between smallpox and measles, and wrote in one of his many books “The
					doctor’s aim is to do good, even to our enemies”. Al-Khwarizmi and other
					mathematicians invented algebra and algorithms; and engineer al-Jazari invented
					the crank-connecting rod system, which is still used in bicycles and cars. It
					would take several centuries for European scientists to catch up with these
					developments.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					to treat Herodotus’s word with caution. Assuming it is true, it is likely that
					Thales had discovered an 18-year cycle in the movements of the Sun and Moon,
					known as the Saros cycle, which was used by later Greek astronomers to predict
					eclipses.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever method Thales used, his prediction had a dramatic effect on the
					battle at the river Halys, in modern-day Turkey. The eclipse ended not only the

				two generations after Thales, Anaximenes suggested that the world is made of air,
				reasoning that when air condenses it produces mist, and then rain, and eventually

				would produce qualities such as heat and wetness to make earth, stone, and all
				plants and animals. Originally, the four roots formed a perfect sphere, held
				together by love, the centripetal force. But gradually strife, the centrifugal

				was so distant that its rays were almost parallel to each other when they hit Earth,

				damaged in any way. He went to the public baths in Syracuse to ponder the problem.
				The bath was full to the brim, and when he climbed in, he noticed two things: the
				water level rose, making some water slop over the side, and he felt weightless. He
				shouted “Eureka!” (I have found the answer!) and ran home stark naked.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-174"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000080.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Measuring volume</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Archimedes had realized that if he lowered the crown into a bucket brimful
					with water, it would displace some water &ndash; exactly the same amount as its own
					volume &ndash; and he could measure how much water spilled out. This would tell him
					the volume of the crown. Silver is less dense than gold, so a silver crown of
					the same weight would be bigger than a gold crown, and would displace more
					water. Therefore, an adulterated crown would displace more water than a pure
					gold crown &ndash; and more than a lump of gold of the same weight. In practice, the
					effect would have been small and difficult to measure. But Archimedes had also
					realized that any object immersed in a liquid experiences an upthrust (upwards
					force) equal to the weight of the liquid it has displaced.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archimedes probably solved the puzzle by hanging the crown and an equal weight
					of pure gold on opposite ends of a stick, which he then suspended by its centre
					so that the two weights balanced. Then he lowered the whole thing into a bath of
					water. If the crown was pure gold, it and the lump of gold would experience an
					equal upthrust, and the stick would stay horizontal. If the crown contained some
					silver, however, the volume of the crown would be greater than the volume of the
					lump of gold &ndash; the crown would displace more water, and the stick would tilt
					sharply.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archimedes’ idea became known as Archimedes’ principle, which states that the
					upthrust on an object in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid the object
					displaces. This principle explains how objects made of dense material can still
					float on water. A steel ship that weighs one tonne will sink until it has
					displaced one tonne of water, but then will sink no further. Its deep, hollow
					hull has a greater volume and displaces more water than a lump of steel of the
					same weight, and is therefore buoyed up by a greater upthrust.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitruvius tells us that Hieron’s crown was indeed found to contain some
					silver, and that the crown-maker was duly punished.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"A solid heavier than a fluid will, if placed in it, descend to the bottom

				through abstract reasoning, not through physical experiments. Alhazen, working in a
				thriving Islamic culture of curiosity and enquiry, was the first to use what we now
				call the scientific method: setting up hypotheses and methodically testing them with
				experiments. As he observed: “The seeker after truth is not one who studies the
				writings of the ancients and…puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects

His most
					important works were studies of the structure of the eye and the process of
					vision. The Greek scholars Euclid and, later, Ptolemy believed that vision
					derived from “rays” that beamed out of the eye and bounced back from whatever a
					person was looking at. Alhazen showed, through the observation of shadows and
					reflection, that light bounces off objects and travels in straight lines into
					our eyes. Vision was a passive, rather than an active, phenomenon, at least
					until it reached the retina. He noted that, “from each point of every coloured
					body, illuminated by any light, issue light and colour along every straight line
					that can be drawn from that point.” In order to see things, we have only to open
					our eyes to let in the light. There is no need for the eye to send out rays,
					even if it could.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Alhazen also found, through his experiments with bulls’ eyes, that light
					enters a small hole (the pupil) and is focused by a lens onto a sensitive
					surface (the retina) at the back of the eye. However, even though he recognized
					the eye as a lens, he did not explain how the eye or the brain forms an
					image.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-189"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000291.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Alhazen provided the first</span> scientific

				that began in the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, Baghdad, in the mid-8th century
				and lasted for about 500 years. It laid the foundations for experimentation and the
				modern scientific method. In the same period in Europe, however, several hundred
				years were to pass before scientific thought was to overcome the restrictions of
				religious dogma.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-192"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000153.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dangerous thinking</h2></div><p class="calibre12">For centuries, the Catholic Church’s view of the Universe was based on
					Aristotle’s idea that Earth was at the orbital centre of all celestial bodies.
					Then, in about 1532, after years of struggling with its complex mathematics,
					Polish physician Nicolaus Copernicus completed his heretical model of the
					Universe that had the Sun at its centre. Aware of the heresy, he was careful to
					state that it was only a mathematical model, and he waited until he was on the
					point of death before publishing, but the Copernican model quickly won many
					advocates. German astrologer Johannes Kepler refined Copernicus’s theory using
					observations by his Danish mentor Tycho Brahe, and calculated that the orbits of
					Mars and, by inference, the other planets were ellipses. Improved telescopes
					allowed Italian polymath Galileo Galilei to identify four moons of Jupiter in
					1610. The new cosmology’s explanatory power was becoming undeniable.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galileo also demonstrated the power of scientific experiment, investigating
					the physics of falling objects and devising the pendulum as an effective
					timekeeper, which Dutchman Christiaan Huygens used to build the first pendulum
					clock in 1657. English philosopher Francis Bacon wrote two books laying out his
					ideas for a scientific method, and the theoretical groundwork for modern
					science, based on experiment, observation, and measurement, was
					developed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;New discoveries followed thick and fast. Robert Boyle used an air pump to
					investigate the properties of air, while Huygens and English physicist Isaac
					Newton came up with opposing theories of how light travels, establishing the
					science of optics. Danish astronomer Ole Rømer noted discrepancies in the
					timetable of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter, and used these to calculate an
					approximate value for the speed of light. Rømer’s compatriot, Bishop Nicolas
					Steno, was sceptical of much ancient wisdom, and developed his own ideas in both
					anatomy and geology. He laid down the principles of stratigraphy (the study of
					rock layers), establishing a new scientific basis for geology.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Micro-worlds</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Throughout the 17th century, developments in technology drove scientific
					discovery at the smallest scale. In the early 1600s, Dutch spectacle-makers
					developed the first microscopes, and, later that century, Robert Hooke built his
					own and made beautiful drawings of his findings, revealing the intricate
					structure of tiny bugs such as fleas for the first time. Dutch draper Antonie
					van Leeuwenhoek, perhaps inspired by Hooke’s drawings, made hundreds of his own
					microscopes and found tiny life forms in places where no one had thought of
					looking before, such as water. Leeuwenhoek had discovered single-celled life
					forms such as protists and bacteria, which he called “animalcules”. When he
					reported his findings to the British Royal Society, they sent three priests to
					certify that he had really seen such things. Dutch microscopist Jan Swammerdam
					showed that egg, larva, pupa, and adult are all stages in the development of an
					insect, and not separate animals created by God. Old ideas dating back to
					Aristotle were swept away by these new discoveries. Meanwhile, English biologist
					John Ray compiled an enormous encyclopaedia of plants, which marked the first
					serious attempt at systematic classification.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Mathematical analysis</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Heralding the Enlightenment, these discoveries laid the groundwork for the
					modern scientific disciplines of astronomy, chemistry, geology, physics, and
					biology. The century’s crowning achievement came with Newton’s treatise
						<i class="calibre11">Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
						Mathematica</i>, which laid out his laws of motion and gravity.
					Newtonian physics was to remain the best description of the physical world for
					more than two centuries, and together with the analytical techniques of calculus
					developed independently by Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, it would
					provide a powerful tool for future scientific study.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				of the Universe that placed Earth at the centre of everything. This “geocentric
				model” seemed at first to be rooted in everyday observations and common sense &ndash; we
				do not feel any motion of the ground on which we stand, and superficially there
				seems to be no observational evidence that our planet is in motion either. Surely
				the simplest explanation was that the Sun, Moon, planets and stars were all spinning
				around Earth at different rates? This system appears to have been widely accepted in
				the ancient world, and became entrenched in classical philosophy through the works
				of Plato and Aristotle in the 4th century BCE.</p><p class="calibre15">However, when the ancient Greeks measured the movements of the planets, it became
				clear that the geocentric system had problems. The orbits of the known planets &ndash;
				five wandering lights in the sky &ndash; followed complex paths. Mercury and Venus were
				always seen in the morning and evening skies, describing tight loops around the Sun.
				Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, meanwhile, took 780 days, 12 years, and 30 years
				respectively to circle against the background stars, their motion complicated by
				“retrograde” loops in which they slowed and temporarily reversed the general
				direction of their motion.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-198"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000388.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"If the Lord Almighty had consulted me before embarking on creation thus, I

					epicycles &ndash; “sub-orbits” around which the planets circled as the central
					“pivot”-points of the sub-orbits were carried around the Sun. This system was
					best refined by the great Greco-Roman astronomer and geographer Ptolemy of
					Alexandria in the 2nd century CE.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the classical world, however, there were differences of opinion &ndash; the
					Greek thinker Aristarchus of Samos, for instance, used ingenious trigonometric
					measurements to calculate the relative distances of the Sun and Moon in the 3rd
					century BCE. He found that the Sun was huge, and this inspired him to suggest
					that the Sun was a more likely pivot-point for the motion of the cosmos.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ptolemaic system ultimately won out over rival theories, with
					far-reaching implications. While the Roman Empire dwindled in subsequent
					centuries, the Christian Church inherited many of its assumptions. The idea that
					Earth was the centre of everything, and that man was the pinnacle of God’s
					creation, with dominion over Earth, became a central tenet of Christianity and
					held sway in Europe until the 16th century.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that astronomy stagnated for a millennium and a
					half after Ptolemy. The ability to accurately predict the movements of the
					planets was not only a scientific and philosophical puzzle, but also had
					supposed practical purposes thanks to the superstitions of astrology. Stargazers

					classical texts, including the astronomical writings of Ptolemy and
					others.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of “positional astronomy” &ndash; calculating the positions of heavenly
					bodies &ndash; reached its apogee in Spain, which had become a dynamic melting pot of
					Islamic, Jewish, and Christian thought. In the late 13th century, King Alfonso X
					of Castile sponsored the compilation of the Alfonsine Tables, which combined new
					observations with centuries of Islamic records to bring new precision to the
					Ptolemaic system and provide the data that would be used to calculate planetary
					positions until the early 17th century.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Questioning Ptolemy</h2></div><p class="calibre12">However, by this point the Ptolemaic model was becoming absurdly complicated,
					with yet further epicycles added to keep prediction in line with observation. In
					1377, French philosopher Nicole Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux, addressed this
					problem head-on in the work <i class="calibre11">Livre du Ciel et du
						Monde</i> (<i class="calibre11">Book of the Heavens and the
						Earth</i>). He demonstrated the lack of observational proof that
					Earth was static, and argued that there was no reason to suppose that it was not
					in motion. Yet, despite his demolition of the evidence for the Ptolemaic system,
					Oresme concluded that he did not himself believe in a moving Earth.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the beginning of the 16th century, the situation had become very different.
					The twin forces of the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation saw many old
					religious dogmas opened up to question. It was in this context that Nicolaus
					Copernicus, a Polish Catholic canon from the province of Warmia, put forward the
					first modern heliocentric theory, shifting the centre of the Universe from Earth
					to the Sun.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Copernicus first published his ideas in a short pamphlet known as the
						<i class="calibre11">Commentariolus</i>, circulated among friends
					from around 1514. His theory was similar in essence to the system proposed by
					Aristarchus, and while it overcame many of the earlier model’s failings, it
					remained deeply attached to certain pillars of Ptolemaic thought &ndash; most
					significantly the idea that the orbits of celestial objects were mounted on
					crystalline spheres that rotated in perfect circular motion. As a result,
					Copernicus had to introduce “epicycles” of his own in order to regulate the
					speed of planetary motions on certain parts of their orbits. One important
					implication of his model was that it vastly increased the size of the Universe.
					If Earth was moving around the Sun, then this should give itself away through
					parallax effects caused by our changing point of view: the stars should appear
					to shift back and forth across the sky throughout the year. Because they do not
					do so, they must be very far away indeed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Copernican model soon proved itself far more accurate than any refinement
					of the old Ptolemaic system, and word spread among intellectual circles across
					Europe. Notice even reached Rome, where, contrary to popular belief, the model
					was at first welcomed in some Catholic circles. The new model caused enough of a
					stir for German mathematician Georg Joachim Rheticus to travel to Warmia and
					become Copernicus’s pupil and assistant from 1539.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Rheticus who published the first widely circulated account of the
					Copernican system, known as the <i class="calibre11">Narratio
						Prima</i>, in 1540. Rheticus urged the ageing priest to publish his
					own work in full &ndash; something that Copernicus had contemplated for many years,
					but only conceded to in 1543 as he lay on his deathbed.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"Since the Sun remains stationary, whatever appears as a motion of the Sun

					though any suggestion that Earth was in motion directly contradicted several
					passages of Scripture and was therefore regarded as heretical by both Catholic
					and Protestant theologians. To sidestep the issue, a preface had been inserted
					that explained the heliocentric model as purely a mathematical tool for
					prediction, not a description of the physical Universe. In his life, however,
					Copernicus himself had shown no such reservations. Despite its heretical
					implications, the Copernican model was used for the calculations involved in the
					great calendar reform introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, new problems with the model’s predictive accuracy soon began to
					emerge, thanks to the meticulous observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho
					Brahe (1546&ndash;1601), which showed that the Copernican model did not adequately
					describe planetary motions. Brahe attempted to resolve these contradictions with
					a model of his own in which the planets went around the Sun but the Sun and Moon
					remained in orbit around Earth. The real solution &ndash; that of elliptical orbits &ndash;
					would only be found by his pupil Johannes Kepler.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be six decades before Copernicanism became truly emblematic of the
					split caused in Europe by the Reformation of the Church, thanks largely to the

					Jupiter convinced him that the heliocentric theory was correct, and his ardent
					support for it, from the heart of Catholic Italy, was ultimately expressed in
					his <i class="calibre11">Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World

					(1546&ndash;1601) made observations that would prove vital to resolving the problems.
					A bright supernova explosion seen in the constellation of Cassiopeia in 1572
					undermined the Copernican idea that the Universe beyond the planets was
					unchanging. In 1577, Brahe plotted the motion of a comet. Comets had been
					thought of as local phenomena, closer than the Moon, but Brahe’s observations
					showed that the comet must lie well beyond the Moon, and was in fact moving
					among the planets. At a stroke, this evidence demolished the idea of “heavenly
					spheres”. However, Brahe remained wedded to the idea of circular orbits in his
					geocentric (Earth-centred) model.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1597, Brahe was invited to Prague, where he spent his last years as

					(egg-shaped) rather than truly circular. Kepler formulated a heliocentric model
					with ovoid orbits, but this still did not match the observational data. In 1605,
					he concluded that Mars must instead orbit the Sun in an ellipse &ndash; a “stretched
					circle” with the Sun as one of two focus points. In his <i class="calibre11">Astronomia Nova</i> (<i class="calibre11">New
						Astronomy</i>) of 1609, he outlined two laws of planetary motion. The
					first law stated that the orbit of every planet is an ellipse. The second law
					stated that a line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps across equal areas during
					equal periods of time. This means that the speed of the planets increases the
					nearer they are to the Sun. A third law, in 1619, described the relationship of
					a planet’s year to its distance from the Sun: the square of a planet’s orbital
					period (year) is proportional to the cube of its distance from the Sun. So a
					planet that is twice the distance from the Sun than another planet will have a
					year that is almost three times as long.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the force keeping the planets in orbit was unknown. Kepler

				external force keeps things moving and that heavy objects fall faster than lighter
				ones. Only in the 17th century did the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo
				Galilei insist that the ideas had to be tested. He devised experiments to test how
				and why objects move and stop moving, and was the first to work out the principle of
				inertia &ndash; that objects resist a change in motion and need a force to start moving,
				speed up, or slow down. By timing objects falling, Galileo showed that the rate of
				fall is the same for all objects, and came to realize the part played by friction in
				slowing them down.</p><p class="calibre15">With the equipment available during the 1630s, Galileo could not directly measure
				the speed or acceleration of freely falling objects. By rolling balls down one ramp
				and up another, he showed that the speed of a ball at the bottom of the ramp
				depended on its starting height, not on the steepness of the ramp, and that a ball
				would always roll up to the same height it had started from, no matter how steep or
				shallow the inclines were.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galileo carried out his remaining experiments with a ramp 5m (16ft) long, lined
				with a smooth material to reduce friction. For timing, he used a large container of
				water with a small pipe in the bottom. He collected the water during the interval he
				was measuring, and weighed the water collected. By letting the ball go at different
				points on the ramp, he showed that the distance travelled depended on the square of
				the time taken &ndash; in other words, the ball accelerated down the ramp.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-217"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000229.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The law of falling bodies</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Galileo’s conclusion was that bodies all fall at the same speed in a vacuum,
					an idea later developed further by Isaac Newton. There is a greater force from
					gravity on a larger mass, but the larger mass also needs a bigger force to make
					it accelerate. The two effects cancel each other out, so in the absence of any
					other forces, all falling objects will accelerate at the same rate. We see
					things falling at different rates in everyday life because of the effect of air
					resistance, which slows objects down at different rates depending on their size
					and shape. A beach ball and a bowling ball of the same size will initially
					accelerate at the same rate. Once they are moving, the same amount of air
					resistance will act on them, but the size of this force will be a much greater
					proportion of the downwards force on the beach ball than the bowling ball, and
					so the beach ball will slow down more.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galileo’s insistence on testing theories with careful observation and
					measurable experiments marks him, like Alhazen, as one of the founders of modern
					science. His ideas on forces and motion paved the way for Newton’s laws of

				to a wider debate about the nature of the space between stars and planets. The
				“atomists” held that there was empty space between celestial bodies, whereas the
				Cartesians (followers of the French philosopher René Descartes) held that the space
				between particles was filled with an unknown substance called the aether, and that
				it was impossible to produce a vacuum.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of the element air, that by

					work out why a suction pump could not raise water more than 10m (33ft) high.
					Berti took a long tube, sealed it at one end and filled it with water. He then
					inverted the tube with its mouth in a tub of water. The level of water in the
					tube fell until the column was about 10m (30ft) high. In 1642, fellow Italian
					Evangelista Torricelli, hearing of Berti’s work, constructed a similar apparatus
					but used mercury instead of water. Mercury is more than 13 times denser than
					water, so his column of liquid was only about 76cm (30in) high. Torricelli’s
					explanation for this was that the weight of the air above the mercury in the
					dish was pressing down on it, and that this balanced the weight of the mercury
					inside the column. He said that the space in the tube above the mercury was a
					vacuum. This is explained today in terms of pressure (force on a certain area),
					but the basic idea is the same. Torricelli had invented the first mercury
					barometer.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;French scientist Blaise Pascal heard of Torricelli’s barometer in 1646,
					prompting him to start some experiments of his own. One of these, carried out by
					his brother-in-law Florin Périer, was to demonstrate that air pressure changed
					depending on altitude. One barometer was set up in the grounds of a monastery in
					Clermont, and observed by a monk during the day. Périer carried the other to the
					top of Puy de Dôme, about 1,000m (3,200ft) above the town. The column of mercury
					was more than 8cm (3in) shorter at the top of the mountain than in the monastery
					garden. As there is less air above a mountain than there is above the valley
					below it, this showed that it was indeed the weight of the air that held the
					liquid in the tubes of mercury or water. For this, and other work, the modern
					unit of pressure is named after Pascal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-230"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000200.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The barometer</span> invented by Evangelista

					Guericke, who made a pump that was capable of pumping some of the air out of a
					container. He carried out his most famous demonstration in 1654, when he put two
					metal hemispheres together with an airtight seal between them and pumped the air
					out of them &ndash;two teams of horses were unable to pull the hemispheres apart.
					Before the air was pumped out, the air pressure inside the sealed hemispheres
					was the same as the air pressure outside. Without the air inside, pressure from
					the outside air held the hemispheres together.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Boyle learned of von Guericke’s experiments when they were published in
					1657. To carry out experiments of his own, Boyle commissioned <a href="#calibre_link-46" class="calibre3">Robert Hooke</a> to
					design and build an air pump. Hooke’s air pump consisted of a glass “receiver”
					(container) whose diameter was nearly 40cm (16in), a cylinder with a piston
					below it, and an arrangement of plugs and stopcocks between them. Successive
					movements of the piston drew more and more air out of the receiver. Owing to
					slow leaks in the seals of the equipment, the near-vacuum inside the receiver
					could only be maintained for a short time. Nevertheless, the machine was a great
					improvement on anything made previously, an example of the importance of
					technology to the furthering of scientific investigation.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"Men are so accustomed to judge of things by their senses that, because the
						air is indivisible, they ascribe but little to it, and think it but one
						remove from nothing."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Robert Boyle</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Experimental results</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Boyle carried out a number of different experiments with the air pump, which
					he described in his 1660 book <i class="calibre11">New Experiments
						Physico-Mechanical</i>. In the book, he is at pains to point out that
					the results described are all from experiment, as at the time even such noted
					experimentalists as Galileo often also reported the results of “thought
					experiments”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of Boyle’s experiments were directly connected to air pressure. The
					receiver could be modified to hold a Torricelli barometer, with the tube
					sticking out of the top of the receiver and sealed in place with cement. As the
					pressure in the receiver was reduced, the level of the mercury fell. He also
					carried out the opposite experiment, and found that raising the pressure inside
					the receiver made the level of the mercury rise. This confirmed the previous
					findings of Torricelli and Pascal.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyle noted that it became harder and harder to pump air out of the receiver
					as the amount of air left decreased, and also showed that a half-inflated
					bladder in the receiver increased in volume as the air surrounding it was
					removed. A similar effect on the bladder could be achieved by holding it in
					front of a fire. He gave two possible explanations for the “spring” of the air
					that caused these effects: each particle of the air was compressible like a
					spring and the whole mass of air resembled a woollen fleece, or the air
					consisted of particles moving randomly.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was similar to the view of the Cartesians, although Boyle did not agree
					with the idea of the aether, but suggested that the “corpuscles” were moving in
					empty space. His explanation is remarkably similar to the modern kinetic theory,
					which describes the properties of matter in terms of moving particles.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Boyle’s experiments were physiological, investigating the effects on
					birds and mice of reducing the pressure of the air, and speculating on how air
					is moved in and out of lungs.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-234"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000409.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Otto von Guericke</span> built the first air

					constant, as long as the amount of gas and the temperature are kept the same. In
					other words, if you decrease the volume of a gas, its pressure increases. It is
					this increased pressure that produces the spring of the air. You can feel this
					effect using a bicycle pump by covering the end with a finger and pushing the
					handle in.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it bears his name, this law was first proposed not by Boyle, but by
					English scientists Richard Towneley and Henry Power, who carried out a series of
					experiments with a Torricelli barometer and published their results in 1663.
					Boyle saw an early draft of the book and discussed the results with Towneley. He
					confirmed them by experiment and published “Mr Towneley’s hypothesis” in 1662 as
					part of a response to criticism of his original experiments.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyle’s work on gases was particularly significant because of his careful
					experimental technique, and also his full reporting of all his experiments and
					their possible sources of error, whether or not they gave the expected results.
					This led many to seek to extend his work. Today, Boyle’s Law has been combined
					with laws worked out by other scientists to form the “Ideal Gas Law”, which
					approximates to the behaviour of real gases under changes of temperature,
					pressure, or volume. His ideas would also eventually lead to the development of
					the kinetic theory.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-236"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000381.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-237"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ROBERT BOYLE</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-238"><img alt="" src="images/000352.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Robert Boyle was born in Ireland, the 14th child of the Earl of Cork.

					years, but lived in Oxford from 1654 to 1668 so that he could carry out his work
					more easily, and then moved to London.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyle was part of a group of men studying scientific subjects called the
					“Invisible College”, who met in London and Oxford to discuss their ideas. This
					group became the Royal Society in 1663, and Boyle was one of the first council

				Huygens both pondered the true nature of light, and reached very different
				conclusions. The problem they faced was that any theory about the nature of light
				had to explain reflection, refraction, diffraction, and colour. Refraction is the
				bending of light as it passes from one substance to another, and is the reason that
				lenses can focus light. Diffraction is the spreading out of light when it passes
				through a very narrow gap.</p><p class="calibre15">Before Newton’s experiments, it was widely accepted that light gained its quality
				of colour by interacting with matter &ndash; that the “rainbow” effect seen when light
				passes through a prism is produced because the prism has somehow stained the light.
				Newton demonstrated that the “white” light that we see is actually a mixture of
				different colours of light, and these are split up by a prism because they are all
				refracted by slightly different amounts.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with many natural philosophers of the time, Newton held that light was
				made up of a stream of particles, or “corpuscles”. This idea explained how light
				travelled in straight lines and “bounced” off reflective surfaces. It also explained
				refraction in terms of forces at the boundaries between different materials.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-241"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000300.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Partial reflection</h2></div><p class="calibre12">However, Newton’s theory could not explain how, when light hits many surfaces,
					some is reflected and some is refracted. In 1678, Huygens argued that space was
					filled with weightless particles (the aether), and that light caused
					disturbances in the aether that spread out in spherical waves. Refraction was
					thus explained if different materials (be they aether, water, or glass) caused
					light waves to travel at different speeds. Huygens’ theory could explain why
					both reflection and refraction can occur at a surface. It could also explain
					diffraction.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Huygens’ ideas made little impact at the time. This was in part due to
					Newton’s already giant stature as a scientist. However, a century later, in
					1803, Thomas Young showed that light does indeed behave as a wave, and
					experiments in the 20th century have shown that it behaves both like a wave and
					a particle, although there are big differences between Huygens’ “spherical
					waves” and our modern models of light. Huygens said that light waves were
					longitudinal as they passed through a substance &ndash; the aether. Sound waves are
					also longitudinal waves, in which the particles of the substance the wave is
					passing through vibrate in the same direction as the wave is travelling. Our
					modern view of light waves is that they are transverse waves that behave more
					like waves of water. They do not need matter to propagate (transmit), while
					particles vibrate at right angles (up and down) to the wave’s direction.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-243"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000365.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">When white light</span> passes through a

				spontaneous generation from non-living matter. The theory of “preformism” held that
				a “higher” organism took its fully mature form in its miniscule beginning, but that
				“lower” animals were too simple to have complex innards. In 1669, pioneering Dutch
				microscopist Jan Swammerdam disproved Aristotle by dissecting insects under the

					are different forms of the same creature. Each life stage has its own fully
					formed internal organs, as well as early versions of the organs for later
					stages. Seen in this new light, insects clearly warranted further scientific
					study. Swammerdam went on to pioneer the classification of insects based on
					their reproduction and development, before dying of malaria, aged 43.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre17"><b class="calibre14">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-46" class="calibre3">Robert Hooke</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-47" class="calibre3">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-37" class="calibre3">John Ray</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-17" class="calibre3">Carl Linnaeus</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-45" class="calibre3">Louis Pasteur</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				Italy.</p><p class="calibre15">Steno’s Law of Superposition states that any single sedimentary deposit, or
				stratum, is younger than the sequence of strata upon which it rests, and older than
				the strata that rest upon it. Steno’s principles of original horizontality and

				layers, and if they are found tilted, folded, or broken, they must have experienced

				discovered an entirely new world &ndash; the world of previously unseen microscopic life,
				including human sperm, blood cells, and, most dramatically of all, bacteria.</p><p class="calibre15">Before the 17th century, no one suspected there was life too small to see with the
				naked eye. Fleas were thought to be the smallest possible form of life. Then, in
				about 1600, the microscope was invented by <a href="#calibre_link-46" class="calibre3">Dutch
					spectacle-makers</a> who put two glass lenses together to boost their
					magnification. In 1665, English scientist Robert Hooke made the first drawing
				of tiny living cells that he had seen in a slice of cork through a
				microscope.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;It never occurred to Hooke or any other microscopist of the time to look for life
				anywhere they could not already see it with their own eyes. Leeuwenhoek, by
				contrast, turned his lenses on places where there appeared to be no life at all,
				particularly in liquids. He studied raindrops, tooth plaque, dung, sperm, blood, and
				much more besides. It was here, in these apparently lifeless substances, that
				Leeuwenhoek discovered the richness of microscopic life.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Hooke, Leeuwenhoek did not use a two-lens “compound” microscope, but a
				single, high-quality lens &ndash; really a magnifying glass. At the time, it was in fact
				easier to produce a clear picture with such simple microscopics. A magnification
				greater than 30 times was impossible with compound microscopes as the image became
				blurred. Leeuwenhoek ground his own single lens microscopes, and after years of
				honing his technique, managed a magnification of more than 200 times. His
				microscopes were small devices with tiny lenses just a few millimetres (fractions of
				an inch) wide. The sample was placed on a pin on one side of the lens, and
				Leeuwenhoek held one eye up close to the other side.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-260"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000049.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">When Leeuwenhoek’s drawings</span> of human sperm

					the simple life forms that are now known as protists. Leeuwenhoek called these
					tiny creatures “animalcules”. In October 1676, he discovered even smaller
					single-celled bacteria in drops of water. In the following year, he described
					how his own semen was swarming with the little creatures we now call sperm.
					Unlike the creatures he had found in water, the animalcules in semen were all
					identical. Each of the many thousands he looked at had the same tiny tail and
					the same tiny head, and nothing else, and he could see them swimming like
					tadpoles in the semen.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leeuwenhoek reported his findings in a series of hundreds of letters to the

				was observing the skies of northern Europe, in the late 17th century. These moons
				are eclipsed as they pass through the shadow cast by Jupiter and at certain times
				they can be observed either entering or leaving the shadow, depending on the
				relative positions of Earth and Jupiter around the Sun. For nearly half of the year,
				the eclipses of the moons cannot be observed at all, because the Sun is between
				Earth and Jupiter.</p><p class="calibre15">Giovanni Cassini, the director of the Royal Observatory in Paris when Rømer
				started work there in the late 1660s, published a set of tables predicting the
				moons’ eclipses. Knowing the times of these eclipses provided a new way to work out
				longitude. The measurement of longitude depends on knowing the difference between
				the time at a given location and the time at a reference meridian (in this case,
				Paris). On land at least, it was now possible to calculate longitude by observing
				the time of an eclipse of one of Jupiter’s moons and comparing it to the predicted
				time of the eclipse in Paris. It was not possible to hold a telescope steadily
				enough onboard ship to observe the eclipses, and measuring longitude at sea remained
				impossible until John Harrison built the first marine chronometers &ndash; clocks that
				could keep time at sea &ndash; in the 1730s.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-267"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000359.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Finite or infinite speed?</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Rømer studied observations of the eclipses of the moon Io taken over a period

					found a discrepancy of 11 minutes between observations taken when Earth was
					closest to Jupiter and those taken when it was furthest away. This discrepancy
					could not be explained by any of the known irregularities in the orbits of
					Earth, Jupiter, or Io. It had to be the time it took for light to travel the
					diameter of Earth’s orbit. Knowing the diameter of Earth’s orbit, Rømer could
					now calculate the speed of light. He produced a figure of 214,000km/s (133,000
					miles/s). The current value is 299,792km/s (186,282 miles/s), so Rømer’s
					calculation was out by about 25 per cent. Nevertheless, this was an excellent
					first approximation, and it solved the previously open question as to whether
					light had a finite speed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, Isaac Newton readily accepted Rømer’s hypothesis that light did
					not travel instantaneously. However, not everyone agreed with Rømer’s reasoning.
					Cassini pointed out that discrepancies in the observations of the other moons
					were still not accounted for. Rømer’s findings were not universally accepted
					until English astronomer James Bradley produced his more accurate figure for the

					introduced the distinction between monocotyledons (plants with a single seed
					leaf) and dicotyledons (plants with two seed leaves). However, he recommended a
					limit to the number of features used for classification, to prevent species
					numbers multiplying to unworkable proportions. His major work, <i class="calibre11">Historia Plantarum</i> (<i class="calibre11">Treatise on Plants</i>), published in three volumes in 1686, 1688,

					me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation
					from seed…Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct
					species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice
					versa.” Ray established the basis of a true-breeding group by which a species is
					still defined today. In so doing, he made botany and zoology scientific
					pursuits. Devoutly religious, Ray saw his work as a means of displaying the

				Universe, in which Earth and the other planets orbit the Sun, was the accepted
				explanation for the observed movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets. This model was
				not new, but had returned to prominence when Nicolaus Copernicus published his ideas
				at the end of his life in 1543. In Copernicus’s model, the Moon and each of the
				planets revolved in its own crystalline sphere around the Sun, with an outer sphere
				holding the “fixed” stars. This model was superseded when Johannes Kepler published
				his laws of planetary motion in 1609. Kepler dispensed with Copernicus’s crystalline
				spheres, and showed that the orbits of the planets were ellipses, with the Sun at
				one focus of each ellipse. He also described how the speed of a planet changes as it
				moves.</p><p class="calibre15">What all these models of the Universe lacked was an explanation of why the planets
				moved in the way they did. This is where Newton came in. He realized that the force
				that pulled an apple towards the centre of Earth was the same force that kept the
				planets in their orbits around the Sun, and demonstrated mathematically how this
				force changed with distance. The mathematics he used involved Newton’s three Laws of
				Motion and his Law of Universal Gravitation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-281"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000185.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Changing ideas</h2></div><p class="calibre12">For centuries, scientific thinking had been dominated by the ideas of
					Aristotle, who reached his conclusions without carrying out experiments to test
					them. Aristotle taught that moving objects only kept moving as long as they were
					being pushed, and that heavy objects fell faster than lighter ones. Aristotle
					explained that heavy objects fell to Earth because they were moving towards
					their natural place. He also said that celestial bodies, being perfect, must all
					move in circles at constant speeds.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galileo Galilei came up with a different set of ideas, arrived at through
					experiment. He observed balls running down ramps and demonstrated that objects
					all fall at the same rate if air resistance is minimal. He also concluded that
					moving objects continue to move unless a force, such as friction, acts to slow
					them down. Galileo’s Principle of Inertia was to become part of Newton’s First
					Law of Motion. As friction and air resistance act on all moving objects that we
					encounter in daily life, the concept of friction is not immediately obvious. It
					was only by careful experiment that Galileo could show that the force keeping
					something moving at a steady speed was only needed to counteract
					friction.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-283" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Laws of motion</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Newton experimented in many areas of interest, but no records of his
					experiments on motion survive. His three laws, however, have been verified in
					many experiments, holding true for speeds well below the speed of light. Newton
					stated his first law as: “Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of
					uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by
					forces impressed thereon.” In other words, a stationary object will only start
					to move if a force acts on it, and a moving object continues to move with
					constant velocity unless a force acts on it. Here, velocity means both the
					direction of a moving object and its speed. So an object will only change its
					speed or change direction if a force acts on it. The force that is important is
					the net force. A moving car has many forces on it, including friction and air
					resistance, and also the engine driving the wheels. If the forces pushing the
					car forwards balance the forces trying to slow it down, there is no net force
					and the car will maintain a constant velocity.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton’s Second Law states that the acceleration (a change of velocity) of a
					body depends on the size of the force acting on it, and is often written down as
						<i class="calibre11">F</i> = <i class="calibre11">ma</i>, where <i class="calibre11">F</i> is force, <i class="calibre11">m</i> is mass, and <i class="calibre11">a</i>
					is acceleration. This shows that the greater the force on a body, the greater
					the acceleration. It also shows that the acceleration depends on the mass of a
					body. For a given force, a body with a small mass will accelerate faster than
					one with a larger mass.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Law is stated as “For every action there is an equal and opposite
					reaction.” It means that all forces exist in pairs: if one object exerts a force
					on a second object, then the second object simultaneously exerts a force on the
					first object, and both forces are equal and opposite. In spite of the term
					“action”, movement is not required for this to be true. This is linked to
					Newton’s ideas about gravity, since one example of his Third Law is the
					gravitational attraction between bodies. Not only is Earth pulling on the Moon,
					but the Moon is pulling on Earth with the same force.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-284"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000044.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Rocket engines</span> are an example of
							Newton’s Third Law in action. The rocket produces a jet that is forced

							rocket up.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-285" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Universal attraction</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Newton started thinking about gravity in the late 1660s, when he retired to
					the village of Woolsthorpe for a couple of years to avoid the plague that was
					ravaging Cambridge. At that time, several people had suggested that there was an
					attractive force from the Sun, and that the size of this force was inversely
					proportional to the square of the distance. In other words, if the distance
					between the Sun and another body is doubled, the force between them is only one
					quarter of the original force. However, it was not thought that this rule could
					be applied close to the surface of a large body such as Earth.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton, seeing an apple fall from a tree, reasoned that Earth must be
					attracting the apple and, as the apple always fell perpendicular to the ground,
					its direction of fall was directed to the centre of Earth. So the attractive
					force between Earth and the apple must act as if it originated in the centre of
					Earth. These ideas opened the way to treating the Sun and planets as small
					points with large masses, which made calculations much easier by measuring from
					their centres. Newton saw no reason to think that the force that made an apple
					fall was any different from the forces that kept the planets in their orbits.
					Gravity, then, was a universal force.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;If Newton’s theory of gravity is applied to falling bodies,
						M1 is the mass of Earth and M2
					is the mass of the falling object. So the greater the mass of an object, the
					greater the force pulling it downwards. However, Newton’s Second Law tells us
					that a larger mass does not accelerate as quickly as a smaller one if the force
					is the same. So the greater force is needed to accelerate the greater mass, and
					all objects fall at the same speed, as long as there are no other forces such as
					air resistance to complicate matters. With no air resistance, a hammer and a
					feather will fall at the same speed &ndash; a fact finally demonstrated in 1971 by
					astronaut Dave Scott, who carried out the experiment on the surface of the Moon
					during the Apollo 15 mission.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton described a thought experiment to explain orbits in an early draft of
					the <i class="calibre11">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
						Mathematica</i>. He imagined a cannon on a very high mountain, firing
					cannon balls horizontally at higher and higher speeds. The higher the speed at
					which a ball is fired, the farther away it will land. If it is launched
					sufficiently fast, it will not land at all, but continue around Earth until it
					arrives back at the top of the mountain. In the same way, a satellite launched
					into orbit at the correct speed will continue to circle Earth. The satellite is
					continually being accelerated by Earth’s gravity. It moves at a constant speed,
					but its direction is continually changing, making it circle the planet rather
					than whizzing off into space in a straight line. In this case, Earth’s gravity
					only changes the direction of the satellite’s velocity, not its speed.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"I have not been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity

					Wren that he had discovered the laws of planetary motion. Halley was a friend of
					Newton, and asked him about this. Newton said that he had already solved the
					problem, but had lost his notes. Halley encouraged Newton to redo the work, and
					as a result, Newton produced <i class="calibre11">On the Motion of Bodies in
						an Orbit</i>, a short manuscript sent to the Royal Society in 1684.
					In this paper, Newton showed that the elliptical motion of the planets that
					Kepler described would result from a force pulling everything towards the Sun,
					where that force was inversely proportional to the distance between the bodies.
					Newton expanded on this work, and included other work on forces and motion, in
					the <i class="calibre11">Principia Mathematica, which</i> was
					published in three volumes and contained, among other things, the Law of
					Universal Gravitation and Newton’s three Laws of Motion. The volumes were
					written in Latin, and it was not until 1729 that the first English translation
					was published, based on Newton’s third edition of the <i class="calibre11">Principia Mathematica</i>.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooke and Newton had already fallen out over Hooke’s criticisms of Newton’s
					theory of light. Following Newton’s publication, however, much of Hooke’s work
					on planetary motion was obscured. However, Hooke had not been the only one to
					suggest such a law, and he had not demonstrated that it worked. Newton had shown
					that his Law of Universal Gravitation and laws of motion could be used
					mathematically to describe the orbits of planets and comets, and that these
					descriptions matched observations.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-288"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000102.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Newton’s thought experiment</span> described a

					1607. The comet is now called Halley’s comet. Halley successfully predicted that
					it would return in 1758, which was 16 years after his death. This was the first
					time that comets had been shown to orbit the Sun. Halley’s comet passes near to
					Earth every 75&ndash;76 years, and was the same comet as that seen in 1066 before the
					Battle of Hastings in southern England.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The equations were also used successfully to discover a new planet. Uranus is
					the seventh planet from the Sun, and was identified as a planet by William
					Herschel in 1781. Herschel found the planet by chance while making careful
					observations of the night sky. Further observations of Uranus allowed
					astronomers to calculate its orbit and to produce tables predicting where it
					could be observed at future dates. These predictions were not always correct,
					however, leading to the idea that there must be another planet beyond Uranus
					whose gravity was affecting the orbit of Uranus. By 1845, astronomers had
					calculated where this eighth planet should be in the sky, and Neptune was
					discovered in 1846.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Problems with the theory</h2></div><p class="calibre12">For a planet with an elliptical orbit, the point of closest approach to the
					Sun is called the perihelion. If there were only one planet orbiting the Sun,
					the perihelion of its orbit would stay in the same place. However all the
					planets in our Solar System affect each other, so the perihelia precess (rotate)
					around the Sun. Like all the other planets, Mercury’s perihelion precesses, but
					the precession cannot be completely accounted for using Newton’s equations. This
					was recognized as a problem in 1859. More than 50 years later, Einstein’s Theory
					of General Relativity described gravity as an effect of the curvature of
					space-time, and calculations based on this theory do account for the observed

					experiments with plants, discovering root pressure &ndash; by which sap rises through
					plants &ndash; and inventing the pneumatic trough, a laboratory apparatus for
					collecting gases, which was to prove useful for later work identifying the
					components of air. Daniel Bernoulli, the brightest in a family of Swiss
					mathematicians, formulated the Bernoulli principle &ndash; that the pressure of a
					fluid falls when it is moving. This allowed him to measure blood pressure. It is
					also the principle that allows aircraft to fly.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1754, Scottish chemist Joseph Black, who would later formulate the theory
					of latent heat, produced a remarkable doctoral thesis about the decomposition of
					calcium carbonate and the generation of “fixed air”, or carbon dioxide. This
					sparked a chain reaction of chemical research and discovery. In England,
					reclusive genius Henry Cavendish isolated hydrogen gas and demonstrated that
					water is made of two parts of hydrogen to one of oxygen. Dissident minister
					Joseph Priestley isolated oxygen and several other new gases. Dutchman Jan
					Ingenhousz picked up where Priestley left off and showed how green plants give
					off oxygen in sunlight and carbon dioxide in the dark. Meanwhile, in France,
					Antoine Lavoisier showed that many elements, including carbon, sulphur, and
					phosphorus, burn by combining with oxygen to form what we now call oxides, thus
					debunking the theory that combustible materials contain a substance called
					phlogiston that make them burn. (Unfortunately, French revolutionaries would
					send Lavoisier to the guillotine.)</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1793, French chemist Joseph Proust discovered that chemical elements nearly

				groups of named and described organisms is a foundation stone of the biological
				sciences. These groupings help to make sense of life’s diversity, allowing
				scientists to compare and identify millions of individual organisms. Modern taxonomy
				&ndash; the science of identifying, naming, and classifying organisms &ndash; began with the
				Swedish naturalist, Carl Linnaeus. He was the first to devise a systematic
				hierarchy, based on his wide-ranging and detailed study of physical characteristics
				of plants and animals. He also pioneered a way of naming different organisms that is
				still in use today.</p><p class="calibre15">The most influential of early classifications was that of the Greek philosopher
				Aristotle. In his <i class="calibre11">History of Animals</i>, he grouped
				similar animals into broad genera, distinguished the species within each group, and
				ranked them on a <i class="calibre11">scala naturae</i> or “ladder of
				life” with 11 grades of increasing complexity in form and purpose, from plants at
				the base to humans at the apex.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the ensuing centuries, a chaotic multiplicity of names and descriptions of
				plants and animals appeared. By the 17th century, scientists were striving to set
				out a more coherent and consistent system. In 1686, English botanist John Ray
				introduced the concept of the biological species, defined by the ability of plants
				or animals to reproduce with one another, and this remains the most widely accepted
				definition today.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1735, Linnaeus produced a classification in a 12-page booklet that grew into a
				multivolume 12th edition by 1778 and developed the idea of the genus into a
				hierarchy of groupings based on shared physical characteristics. At the top were
				three kingdoms: animals, plants, and minerals. Kingdoms were divided into phyla,
				then classes, orders, families, genera, and species. He also stabilized the naming
				of species by using a two-part Latin name, with one name for the genus and another
				for a species within that genus, as in <i class="calibre11">Homo
					sapiens</i> &ndash; Linnaeus was the first to define humans as animals.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-303"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000314.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-304" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">God-given order</h2></div><p class="calibre12">For Linnaeus, classification revealed that “nature does not proceed in leaps
					and bounds” but rather in its God-given order. His work was the fruit of
					numerous expeditions across Sweden and Europe in search of new species. His
					classification system paved the way for Charles Darwin, who saw the evolutionary
					significance of its “natural hierarchy”, with all species in a genus or family
					related by descent and divergence from a common ancestor. A century after
					Darwin, German biologist Willi Hennig developed a new approach to
					classification, called cladistics. To reflect their evolutionary links, this
					groups organisms into “clades” with one or more shared unique characteristics,
					which they have inherited from their last common ancestor and which are not
					found in more distant ancestors. The process of classification by clades
					continues to this day, with species reassigned new positions as fresh, often
					genetic, evidence is found.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-305"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000339.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Linnaeus’s system</span> groups organisms

				science.</p><p class="calibre15">Some of Black’s students were the sons of Scottish whisky distillers, who were
				concerned about the costs of running their businesses. Why, they asked him, was it
				so expensive to distil whisky, when all they were doing was boiling the liquid and
				condensing the vapour.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-310"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000239.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-311" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An idea brought to the boil</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In 1761, Black investigated the effects of heat on liquids, and discovered
					that if a pan of water is heated on a stove, the temperature increases steadily
					until it reaches 100°C (212°F). Then the water begins to boil, but the
					temperature does not change, even though heat is still going into the water.
					Black realized that the heat is needed to turn the liquid into vapour &ndash; or, in
					modern terms, to give the molecules enough energy to escape from the bonds that
					hold them fast in the liquid. This heat does not change the temperature, and
					seems to disappear &ndash; so Black called it latent heat (from the Latin for
					“hidden”). More precisely, it is the latent heat of evaporation of water. This
					discovery was the beginning of the science of thermodynamics &ndash; the study of
					heat, its relation to energy, and the conversion of heat energy into motion to
					do mechanical work.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Water has an unusually high latent heat, meaning that liquid water will boil
					for a long time before it all turns into gas. This is why steaming is such an
					effective way of cooking vegetables, why steam has terrible scalding power, and
					why it is used in heating systems.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-312"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000215.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Black is shown here</span> visiting the

					it floats, thus cooling down the liquid.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Black explained all this to the distillers, although he was unable to help
					them save money. He also explained it to a colleague called James Watt, who was
					trying to work out why steam engines were so inefficient. Subsequently, Watt
					came up with the idea of the separate condenser, which condensed the steam
					without cooling the piston and cylinder. This made the steam engine a far more
					efficient machine, and made Watt a rich man.</p></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-314"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">JOSEPH BLACK</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-315"><img alt="" src="images/000186.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Born in Bordeaux, France, Joseph Black studied medicine at the universities of
					Glasgow and Edinburgh, conducting chemical experiments in the laboratory of his
					professor. In his 1754 doctoral thesis, Black showed that when chalk (calcium
					carbonate) is heated to become quicklime (calcium oxide), it does not gain some
					fiery principle from the fire, as was commonly believed, but loses weight. Black
					realized that this loss must be a gas, since no liquid or solid was produced,
					and called it “fixed air” because it was an air (gas) that had been fixed in the
					chalk. He also showed that fixed air (which we now know as carbon dioxide) was
					among the gases that we exhale.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;While professor of medicine at Glasgow from 1756, Black conducted his landmark

					(CO2) as “fixed air”. He was not only the first scientist
				to identify a gas, but also demonstrated that there were various kinds of “air”, or
				gases.</p><p class="calibre15">Twelve years later, an English scientist named Henry Cavendish reported to the
				Royal Society in London that the metals zinc, iron, and tin “generate inflammable
				air by solution in acids”. He called his new gas “inflammable air” because it burned
				readily, unlike ordinary or “fixed air”. Today we call it hydrogen
					(H2). This was the second gas to be identified and the
				first gaseous element to be isolated. Cavendish set out to measure the weight of a
				sample of the gas, by measuring the loss of weight of the zinc-acid mixture during
				the reaction, and by collecting all the gas produced in a bladder and weighing it &ndash;
				first full of the gas, then empty. Knowing the volume, he could calculate its
				density. He found that inflammable air was 11 times less dense than ordinary
				air.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of low-density gas led to aeronautical balloons that were lighter
				than air. In France in 1783, inventor Jacques Charles launched the first hydrogen
				balloon, less than two weeks after the Montgolfier brothers launched their first
				manned hot-air balloon.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-318"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000081.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Explosive discoveries</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Cavendish also mixed measured samples of his gas with known volumes of air in

					pieces of paper. He found that with nine parts of air to one of hydrogen there
					was a slow, quiet flame; with increasing proportions of hydrogen the mixture
					exploded with increasing ferocity; but pure, 100 per cent hydrogen did not
					ignite.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavendish’s thinking was still handicapped by an obsolete notion from alchemy
					that a fire-like element (“phlogiston”) was released during combustion. However,
					he was precise in his experiments and in his reporting: “it appears that 423
					measures of inflammable air are nearly sufficient to phlogisticate 1,000 of
					common air; and that the bulk of the air remaining after the explosion is then
					very little more than four-fifths of the common air employed. We may conclude
					that…almost all the inflammable air and about one fifth of the common air…are
					condensed into the dew which lines the glass.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"It appears from these experiments, that this air, like other inflammable

					showed that the composition of water is H2O. Although he
					reported his findings to Joseph Priestley, Cavendish was so diffident about
					publishing the results that his friend the Scottish engineer James Watt was the
					first to announce the formula, in 1783.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his many contributions to science, Cavendish went on to calculate the

				ahead” of the air in the tropics, so the winds come from the east. Later, English
				astronomer Edmond Halley realized that the Sun’s heat, at its greatest over the
				equator, causes air to rise, and that rising air is replaced by winds blowing in
				from higher latitudes.</p><p class="calibre15">In 1735, English physicist George Hadley published his theory on trade winds. He
				agreed that the Sun causes air to rise, but rising air near the equator would only
				cause winds to flow towards it from the north and south, not from the east. As the
				air rotates with Earth, air moving from 30°N towards the equator would have its own
				momentum towards the east. However, Earth’s surface moves faster at the equator than
				at higher latitudes, so the surface speed becomes greater than the air’s speed and
				the winds appear to come from an increasingly easterly direction as they near the
				equator.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadley’s idea was a step on the way to understanding wind patterns, but contained

				Priestley became interested in investigating various other “airs”, or gases, and
				identified several more &ndash; most notably oxygen.</p><p class="calibre15">While a minister in Leeds, Priestley visited the brewery close to his lodgings.
				The layer of air above the brewing vat was already known to be fixed air. He found
				that when he lowered a candle over the vat, the candle went out about 30cm (12in)
				above the froth, where the flame entered the layer of fixed air floating there. The
				smoke drifted across the top of the fixed air, making it visible and revealing the
				boundary between the two airs. He also noticed that the fixed air flowed over the
				side of the vat and sank to the floor, because it was denser than “ordinary” air.
				When Priestley experimented with dissolving fixed air in cold water, sloshing it
				from one vessel to another, he found that it made a refreshing sparkling drink,
				which later led to the craze for soda water.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-333"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000305.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-334" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Releasing oxygen</h2></div><p class="calibre12">On 1 August 1774, Priestley first isolated his new gas &ndash; which we now know as
					oxygen (O2) &ndash; from mercuric oxide in a sealed glass flask
					by heating it with sunlight and a magnifying glass. He later discovered that
					this new gas kept mice alive for much longer than ordinary air, was pleasant to
					breathe and more energizing than ordinary air, and supported the combustion of
					various substances he burned as fuel. He also showed that plants produce the gas
					in sunlight &ndash; a first hint of the process we call photosynthesis. At the time,
					however, combustion was thought to involve the release from a fuel of a
					mysterious material called phlogiston. Because this new gas did not burn, and
					therefore must contain no phlogiston, he called it “dephlogisticated
					air”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Priestley isolated several other gases at about this time, but then went on a
					European tour, and did not publish his results until late the following year.
					Swedish chemist Carl Scheele had prepared oxygen two years before Priestley, but
					did not publish his results until 1777. Meanwhile in Paris, Antoine Lavoisier
					heard of Scheele’s work, was given a demonstration by Priestley, and promptly
					made his own oxygen. His experiments on combustion and respiration proved that
					combustion is a process of combining with oxygen, not liberating phlogiston. In
					respiration, oxygen absorbed from the air reacts with glucose and releases
					carbon dioxide, water, and energy. He named the new gas <i class="calibre11">oxygène</i>, or “acid-maker”, when he discovered that it reacts with
					some materials &ndash; such as sulphur, phosphorus, and nitrogen &ndash; to make
					acids.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This led many scientists to abandon phlogiston, but Priestley, though a great
					experimenter, clung to the old theory to explain his discoveries and made little

				science, not least by naming oxygen and quantifying its role in combustion. By
				taking careful measurements of mass in the chemical reactions that occur during
				combustion, he demonstrated the conservation of mass &ndash; the principle that, in a
				reaction, the total mass of all the substances taking part is the same as the total
				mass of all its products.</p><p class="calibre15">Lavoisier heated various substances in sealed containers and found that the mass a
				metal gained when it was heated was exactly equal to the mass of air lost. He also
				found that burning stopped when the “pure” part of the air (oxygen) had all gone.
				The air that remained (mostly nitrogen) did not support combustion. He realized that
				combustion therefore involved a combination of heat, fuel (the burning material),
				and oxygen.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Published in 1778, Lavoisier’s results not only demonstrated the conservation of
				mass, but also, by identifying oxygen’s role in combustion, demolished the theory of
				a fire element called phlogiston. For the past century, scientists had thought
				inflammable substances contained phlogiston and released it when they burned. The
				theory explained why substances such as wood lost mass on burning, but not why
				others, such as magnesium, gained mass on burning. Lavoisier’s careful measurements
				showed that oxygen was the key, in a process during which nothing was added or lost,
				but all was transformed.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"I consider nature a vast chemical laboratory in which all kinds of composition

					dark. He collected the gas produced only in sunlight, and found that it re-lit a
					glowing splint &ndash; this was oxygen. The gas given off by plants in the dark put
					out a flame &ndash; this was carbon dioxide.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingenhousz knew that plants put on weight with little change in the weight of

				scoured the sky and identified a wide variety of “non-stellar” objects &ndash; star
				clusters and nebulae that looked like amorphous clouds of gas or dense balls of
				light.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisted by his sister Caroline, Herschel systematically quartered the sky,
				recording curiosities such as the unexpectedly large number of double and multiple
				stars. He even attempted to compile a map of the Milky Way galaxy based on the
				number of stars he counted in different directions.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13 March 1781, Herschel was scanning the constellation Gemini when he spotted a

				too slowly to be a comet, and might in fact be a planet in a distant orbit.
				Swedish-Russian Anders Johan Lexell and German Johann Elert Bode independently

				polymath John Michell set out his thoughts on the effect of gravity. The letter was
				rediscovered in the 1970s and found to contain a remarkable description of black
				holes. Newton’s law of gravity states that an object’s gravitational pull increases
				with its mass. Michell considered what might happen to light if it is affected by
				gravity. He wrote: “If the semidiameter of a sphere of the same density with the sun
				were to exceed the sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an
				infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface a greater velocity
				than that of light, &amp; consequently, supposing light to be attracted by the same
				force…all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it.” In
				1796, French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace came up with a similar idea in his
					<i class="calibre11">Exposition du Système du Monde</i>.</p><p class="calibre15">However, the idea of a black hole would lie dormant until Albert Einstein’s 1915
				paper on general relativity, which described gravity as a result of the curving of
				space-time. Einstein showed how matter can wrap space-time around itself, making a
				black hole within a region called the Schwarzschild radius, or event horizon. Matter
				&ndash; and also light &ndash; can enter it, but cannot leave. In this picture, the speed of
				light is unchanged. Rather, it is the space the light travels through that changes,
				but Michell’s intuition now had a mechanism by which the velocity of light would at
				least appear to diminish.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-353"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000067.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">From theory to reality</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Einstein himself doubted whether black holes existed in reality. It was not
					until the 1960s that they began to acquire general acceptance as indirect
					evidence of their existence grew. Today, most cosmologists think that black
					holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, and grow as they
					assimilate ever more matter, and that a giant black hole lurks at the centre of
					every galaxy. Black holes pull matter in, but nothing escapes, apart from faint
					infrared radiation, known as Hawking radiation after Stephen Hawking, the
					physicist who proposed it. An astronaut falling into a black hole would feel
					nothing and notice nothing unusual on the approach to the event horizon, but if
					he or she dropped a clock towards the black hole, the clock would appear to slow
					down, and approach but never quite reach the event horizon, gradually fading
					from sight.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems with the theory still exist, however. In 2012, physicist Joseph
					Polchinski suggested that effects at the quantum scale would create a “firewall”
					at the event horizon that would burn any astronaut falling through it to a
					crisp. In 2014, Hawking changed his mind and concluded that black holes cannot

				that lightning is also a form of electricity. Franklin’s work inspired Joseph

					philosophy, was intrigued by Galvani’s observations and was initially convinced
					by his theory.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Volta himself had a notable background in electricity experiments. In 1775, he
					had invented the “electrophorus”, a device that provided an instant source of
					electricity for an experiment (the modern equivalent is a capacitor). It
					consisted of a resin disc rubbed with cat fur to give it a static electric
					charge. Each time a metal disc was placed over the resin, the charge was
					transferred, electrifying the metal disc.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Volta stated that Galvani’s animal electricity was “among the demonstrated
					truths”. But he soon began to have his doubts. He came to the conclusion that
					the electricity causing the frog’s legs to twitch on the hook came from the
					touching of the two different metals (the brass and the iron). He published his
					ideas in 1792 and 1793, and set about investigating the phenomenon.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Volta found that a single junction of two different metals did not produce
					much electricity, although there was enough for him to feel a curious sensation
					with his tongue. But then he had the brilliant idea of multiplying the effect by
					making a series of such junctions connected by salt water. He took a small disc
					of copper, then placed a disc of zinc on top, then a piece of cardboard soaked
					in salt water, then another disc of copper, zinc, salty wet cardboard, copper,
					zinc, and so on, until he had a column, or stack. In other words, he created a
					pile, or “battery”. The point of the salty wet cardboard was to carry the
					electricity without letting the metals either side of it come into contact with
					each other.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was, literally, electrifying. Volta’s crude battery probably
					produced only a few volts (the electrical unit named after him), but that was
					enough to make a tiny spark when the two ends were connected by a piece of wire,
					and enough to give him a mild electric shock.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"Each metal has a certain power, which is different from metal to metal, of

					effect to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, but more importantly, in March 1800, he
					had reported his results in a long letter to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the
					Royal Society in Britain. The letter was entitled</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;“On the electricity excited by the mere Contact of conducting Substances of
					different Kinds”, and in it Volta describes his apparatus: “I place then
					horizontally, on a table or any other stand, one of the metallic pieces, for
					example one of silver, and over the first I adapt one of zinc; on the second I
					place one of the moistened discs, then another plate of silver followed
					immediately by another of zinc…I continue to form…a column as high as possible
					without any danger of its falling.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a buzzer or a semiconductor to detect voltage, Volta used his body as
					a detector, and did not seem to mind getting electric shocks: “I receive from a
					column formed of twenty pairs of pieces (not more) shocks which affect the whole
					finger with considerable pain.” He then describes a more elaborate apparatus,
					consisting of a series of cups or drinking glasses, each containing salt water,
					arranged in a line or a circle. Each pair is connected by a piece of metal that
					dips into the liquid in each cup. One end of this metal is silver, the other
					zinc, and these metals may be soldered together or connected by a wire of any
					metal, provided that only the silver dips into the liquid in one cup, and only
					the zinc into the next. He explains that this is in some ways more convenient
					than the solid pile, albeit more cumbersome.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Volta describes in detail the various unpleasant sensations that result from
					putting one hand in the bowl at one end of the chain and touching a wire
					attached to the other end to the forehead, eyelid, or tip of the nose: “I feel
					nothing for some moments; afterwards, however, there begins at the part applied
					to the end of the wire, another sensation, which is a sharp pain (without
					shock), limited precisely to the point of contact, a quivering, not only
					continued, but which always goes on increasing to such a degree, that in a
					little time it becomes insupportable, and does not cease till the circle is
					interrupted.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-364"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000274.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Volta demonstrated</span> his electric pile to

					were in progress, but Banks immediately spread the word to anyone who might be
					interested. Within weeks, people all over Britain were making electric batteries
					and investigating the properties of current electricity. Before 1800, scientists
					had had to work with static electricity, which is difficult and unrewarding.
					Volta’s invention allowed them to find out how a range of materials &ndash; liquids,
					solids, and gases &ndash; react to a live electrical current.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the first to work with Volta’s discovery were William Nicholson, Anthony
					Carlisle, and William Cruickshank, who, in May 1800, made their own “pile of
					thirty-six half crowns with the correspondent pieces of zinc and pasteboard” and
					passed the current through platinum wires into a tube filled with water. The
					bubbles of gas that appeared were identified as two parts of hydrogen and one
					part of oxygen. Henry Cavendish had shown that the formula of water is
						H2O, but this was the first time anyone had split
					water into its separate elements.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Volta’s pile was the ancestor of all modern batteries, used in everything from
					hearing aids to trucks and aircraft. Without batteries, many of our everyday
					devices would not work.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"The language of experiment is more authoritative than any reasoning: facts

					only creating a new branch of physics but rapidly advancing the development of
					modern technology, Volta’s pile led to a whole new chemical classification of
					metals, for he tried a variety of pairs of metals in his pile, and found that
					some worked much better than others. Silver with zinc made an excellent
					combination, as did copper with tin, but if he tried silver and silver, or tin
					and tin, he got no electricity at all; the metals had to be different. He showed
					that metals could be arranged in a sequence such that each became positive when
					placed in contact with the one next below it in the series. This electrochemical
					series has been invaluable to chemists ever since.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Who was right?</h2></div><p class="calibre12">An ironic aspect of this story is that Volta started investigating the
					touching of different metals only because he doubted Galvani’s hypothesis. Yet
					Galvani was not entirely wrong &ndash; our nerves do indeed work by sending electrical
					impulses around the body &ndash; while Volta himself did not get his theory entirely
					right. He believed that the electricity arose from just the touching together of
					two different metals, whereas Humphry Davy later showed that something could not
					come from nothing. When electricity is being generated, something else must be
					consumed. Davy suggested that there was a chemical reaction going on, and this
					led him to further important discoveries about electricity.</p></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="section_feature2" id="calibre_link-368"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ALESSANDRO VOLTA</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-369"><img alt="" src="images/000252.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Born in 1745 in Como, northern Italy, Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio
					Volta was brought up in an aristocratic, religious family who hoped that he

					1776, and investigated its combustion by the novel method of igniting it with an
					electrical spark inside a sealed glass vessel.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1779, Volta was appointed professor of physics at the University of Pavia,

					appearance of Adam and Eve.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Best known of these Biblical calculations is that by James Ussher, the
					protestant Primate of all Ireland. In 1654, Ussher pinpointed the date of
					Earth’s creation to the night preceding Sunday 23 October 4004 BCE. This date

					of Earth’s age more empirically. Al-Biruni, a pioneer of experimental science,
					reasoned that if marine fossils were found on dry land, then that land must once
					have been under the sea. Earth, he concluded, must be evolving over long periods
					of time. Another Persian scholar, Avicenna, suggested that layers of rock had
					been laid down one upon another.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1687, a scientific approach to the problem was suggested by Isaac Newton.
					He argued that it would take a large body like Earth about 50,000 years to cool
					if it were made of molten iron. He derived this figure by scaling up the cooling
					time taken for a “globe of iron of an inch in diameter, exposed red hot to open
					air”. Newton had opened the door to a scientific challenge to previous
					understandings of Earth’s formation.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Newton’s lead, French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de
					Buffon, experimented with a large ball of red-hot iron, and showed that if Earth
					were made of molten iron, it would take 74,832 years to cool. In private, Buffon
					thought that Earth must be far older, since aeons of time would be needed for
					chalk mountains to build up from the remains of marine fossils, but he did not
					want to publish this view without evidence.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-375" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Secrets of the rocks</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In Scotland, quite a different approach to the problem of Earth’s age was
					being taken by James Hutton, one of the pre-eminent natural philosophers of the
					Scottish Enlightenment. Hutton was a pioneer of geological fieldwork, and used
					field evidence to demonstrate his arguments to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
					1785.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hutton was impressed by the apparent continuity of the processes by which
					landscape was denuded and its debris deposited into the sea. And yet all these
					processes did not lead to loss of the land surface, as might be expected.
					Perhaps thinking of the famous steam engine built by his friend James Watt,
					Hutton saw Earth as “a material machine moving in all its parts”, with a new
					world constantly reshaped and recycled from the ruins of the old.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hutton formulated his Earth-machine theory before he had found the supporting
					evidence, but, in 1787, he found the “unconformities” he was looking for &ndash;
					breaks in the continuity of sedimentary rocks. He saw that much of the land had
					once been seabed, where layers of sediment had been laid down and compressed. In
					many places these layers had been pushed upwards, so that they were above sea
					level, and often distorted, so that they were not horizontal. He repeatedly
					found that rock material from the truncated upper boundary of older strata was
					incorporated into the base of the younger rocks above.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Such unconformities showed that there had been many episodes in Earth’s
					history when the sequence of erosion, transport, and deposition of rock debris
					had been repeated, and when rock strata had been moved by volcanic activity.
					Today, this is known as the geological cycle. From this evidence, Hutton
					declared that all continents are formed from materials derived from previous
					continents by the same processes, and that these processes still operate today.
					Famously, he wrote that “the result, therefore, of this present enquiry is, that
					we find no vestige of a beginning &ndash; no prospect of an end”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularization of Hutton’s ideas about “deep time” was primarily due to
					John Playfair, a Scottish scientist who published Hutton’s observations in an
					illustrated book, and to British geologist Charles Lyell, who transformed
					Hutton’s ideas into a system called uniformitarianism. This held that the laws
					of nature have always been the same, and therefore the clues to the past lie in
					the present. However, while Hutton’s insights concerning the antiquity of the
					planet rang true to geologists, there was still no satisfactory method of
					determining just how old the planet was.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-376"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000281.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In 1770, Hutton built</span> a house

					crust comprises successive layers of sedimentary strata. Geological mapping of
					these strata revealed that cumulatively they are very thick and many contain the
					fossil remains of the organisms that lived in their respective depositional
					environments. By the 1850s, the geological column of strata (also known as the
					stratigraphic column) had been more or less carved up into some eight named
					systems of strata and fossils, each of which represented a period of geological
					time.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Geologists were impressed by the overall thickness of the strata, estimated to
					be 25&ndash;112km (16&ndash;70 miles) thick. They had observed that the processes of erosion
					and deposition of the rock materials that make up such strata were very slow &ndash;
					estimated to be a few centimetres (inches) every 100 years. In 1858, Charles
					Darwin made a somewhat ill-judged foray into the debate when he estimated that
					it had taken some 300 million years for erosion to cut through the Tertiary and
					Cretaceous period rocks of the Weald in southern England. In 1860, John
					Phillips, a geologist at Oxford University, estimated that Earth is about 96
					million years old.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1862, such geological calculations were scorned by the eminent Scottish
					physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) for being unscientific. Kelvin was a
					strict empiricist and argued that he could use physics to determine an accurate
					age for Earth, which he thought was constrained by the age of the Sun.
					Understanding of Earth’s rocks, their melting points and conductivity, had
					vastly improved since Buffon’s day. Kelvin took Earth’s initial temperature at
					3,900°C (7,000°F) and applied the observation that temperature increases as you
					go downwards from the surface &ndash; by about 0.5°C (1°F) over every 15m (50ft) or
					so. From this, Kelvin calculated that it had taken 98 million years for Earth to
					cool to its present state, which he later reduced to 40 million years.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-378"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000156.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Lord Kelvin</span> pronounced the world to be

					history. However, they had no scientific method with which to contradict
					Kelvin.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1890s, the discovery of naturally occurring radioactive elements in
					some of Earth’s minerals and rocks provided the key that would resolve the
					impasse between Kelvin and the geologists, since the rate at which atoms decay
					makes a reliable timer. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford predicted rates of
					radioactive decay and suggested that radioactivity might be used as a “clock” to
					date minerals and the rocks that contain them.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1905, Rutherford obtained the very first radiometric dates of formation for
					a mineral from Glastonbury, Connecticut: 497&ndash;500 million years. He warned that
					these were minimum dates. In 1907, American radiochemist Bertram Boltwood
					improved on Rutherford’s technique to produce the first radiometric dates of
					minerals in rocks with a known geological context. These included a
					2.2-billion-year-old rock from Sri Lanka, whose age increased previous estimates
					by an order of magnitude. By 1946, British geologist Arthur Holmes had made some
					isotope measurements from lead-bearing rocks from Greenland, which gave an age
					of 3.015 billion years. This was one of the first reliable minimum ages for
					Earth. Holmes went on to estimate the age of the uranium from which the lead was
					derived, obtaining a date of 4.46 billion years, but he thought that must be the
					age of the gas cloud from which Earth formed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in 1953, American geochemist Clair Patterson obtained the first

					Patterson calculated the radiometric date for lead minerals in the Canyon Diablo

					of 4.56 billion years for granite and basalt igneous rocks in Earth’s crust, he
					concluded that the similarity of dates was indicative of the age of Earth’s

				angle of a plumb line on each side of a mountain to find out how far the
				gravitational attraction of the mountain pulled it from the vertical. This deviation
				could be measured by comparing the plumb line to a vertical calculated using
				astronomical methods. If the density and volume of the mountain could be
				ascertained, then, by extension, so could the density of Earth. However, Newton
				himself dismissed the idea because he thought the deviation would be too small to be
				measured with the instruments of the day.</p><p class="calibre15">In 1738, Pierre Bouguer, a French astronomer, attempted the experiment on the
				slopes of Chimborazo in Ecuador. Weather and altitude caused problems, however, and
				Bouguer did not think his measurements were accurate.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1772, Nevil Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society in London that the
				experiment could be conducted in Britain. The Society agreed, and sent a surveyor to
				select a suitable mountain. He chose Schiehallion in Scotland, and Maskelyne spent
				nearly four months making observations from both sides of the mountain.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-385"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000061.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-386" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The density of rocks</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The orientation of the plumb line compared to the stars should have been
					different at the two stations even without any gravitational effects, because of
					the difference in latitude. However, even when this was accounted for, there was
					still a difference of 11.6 seconds of arc (just over 0.003 degrees). Maskelyne
					used a survey of the shape of the mountain and a measurement of the density of
					its rocks to work out the mass of Schiehallion. He was assuming that the whole
					Earth had the same density as Schiehallion, but the deviation of the plumb lines
					showed a measured value of less than half of what he was expecting. Maskelyne
					realized that the density assumption was not correct &ndash; the density of Earth was
					clearly much greater than that of its surface rocks, probably, he reasoned, due
					to the planet having a metallic core. The actual observed angle was used to work
					out that the overall density of Earth is about double that of Schiehallion’s
					rocks.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This result disproved one theory of the time, advocated by English astronomer

				Institution, Michael Faraday imagined the shapes of magnetic fields, and invented
				the world’s first electric motor. In Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell picked up
				Faraday’s ideas and worked out the complex mathematics of electromagnetism.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-396"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000315.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-397" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Seeing the invisible</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Invisible forms of electromagnetic waves were discovered before they were
					understood or the laws governing their behaviour were worked out. Working in
					Bath, Britain, German astronomer William Herschel used a prism to separate the
					various colours of sunlight to investigate their temperatures; he found that his
					thermometer showed a higher temperature beyond the red end of the visible
					spectrum. Herschel had stumbled upon infrared radiation, and ultraviolet
					radiation was discovered the following year &ndash; proving that there was more to the
					spectrum than visible light. In a similar accidental way, Wilhelm Röntgen later
					discovered X-rays in his laboratory in Germany. British physician Thomas Young
					devised a clever double-slit experiment to determine whether light is really a
					wave or a particle. His discovery of wave-like interference appeared to settle
					the argument. In Prague, Austrian physicist Christian Doppler explained the
					colour of binary stars using the idea that light is a wave with a spectrum of
					various frequencies, laying out the phenomenon now known as the Doppler effect.
					Meanwhile, in Paris, French physicists Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault
					measured the speed of light, and showed that it travels more slowly through
					water than through air.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-398" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Chemical changes</h2></div><p class="calibre12">British meteorologist John Dalton tentatively suggested that atomic weights
					might be a useful concept for chemists and ventured to estimate a few of them.
					Fifteen years later, Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius drew up a much more
					complete list of atomic weights. His student, the German chemist Friedrich
					Wöhler, turned an inorganic salt into an organic compound, and so disproved the
					idea that life chemistry operated according to separate rules. In Paris, Louis
					Pasteur further showed that life cannot be generated spontaneously. Inspiration
					for new ideas came from various quarters. The structure of the benzene molecule
					came to German chemist August Kekulé as he drifted off to sleep, while Russian
					chemist Dmitri Mendeleev used a pack of cards to crack the problem of the
					periodic table of the elements. Marie (Skłodowska) Curie isolated polonium and
					radium, and became the only person to win Nobel prizes in both Chemistry and
					Physics.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-399" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Clues from the past</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The century saw nothing short of a revolution in the understanding of life. On
					the south coast of England, Mary Anning documented a series of fossils of
					extinct creatures she had dug out of the cliffs. Soon afterwards, Richard Owen
					coined the word “dinosaurs” to describe the “terrible lizards” that had once
					roamed the planet. Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz suggested that large parts of
					Earth had once been covered with ice, further expanding the idea that Earth has
					experienced very different conditions through its history. Alexander von
					Humboldt used cross-disciplinary insights to uncover the connections in nature
					and established the study of ecology. In France, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck outlined
					a theory of evolution, mistakenly believing that the passing on of acquired
					characteristics was its driving force. Then, in the 1850s, British naturalists
					Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin both hit on the idea of evolution by
					means of natural selection. T H Huxley demonstrated that birds may well have
					evolved from dinosaurs, and the evidence to support evolution mounted.
					Meanwhile, a German-speaking Silesian friar named Gregor Mendel sorted out the
					basic laws of genetics by studying thousands of pea plants. Mendel’s work would
					be neglected for some decades, but its rediscovery would provide the genetic
					mechanism for natural selection.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1900, British physicist Lord Kelvin is alleged to have said “There is
					nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more
					precise measurement.” Little can he have suspected what shocks were just around
					the corner.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				the question of the nature of light. Isaac Newton had argued that a beam of light is
				made of countless, tiny, fast-moving “corpuscles” (particles). If light consists of
				these bullet-like corpuscles, he said, this would explain why light travels in
				straight lines and casts shadows.</p><p class="calibre15">But Newton’s corpuscles did not explain why light refracts (bends when it enters
				glass) or splits into the colours of the rainbow &ndash; also an effect of refraction.
				Christiaan Huygens had argued that light comprises not particles, but waves. If
				light travels as waves, Huygens said, it is easy to explain these effects. However,
				Newton’s stature was such that most scientists backed the particle theory.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in 1801, British physician and physicist Thomas Young hit on a design for a
				simple yet ingenious experiment that would, he believed, settle the question one way
				or the other. The idea began when Young was looking at the patterns of light made by
				a candle shining through a mist of fine water droplets. The pattern showed coloured
				rings around a bright centre, and Young wondered if the rings might be caused by
				interacting waves of light.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-402"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000158.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-403" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The double-slit experiment</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Young made two slits in a piece of card and shone a beam of light onto them.
					On a paper screen placed behind the slits, the light created a pattern that
					convinced Young that it was waves. If light were streams of particles, as Newton
					said, there should simply have been a strip of light directly beyond each slit.
					Instead, Young saw alternating bright and dark bands, like a fuzzy bar code. He
					argued that as light waves spread out beyond the slits, they interact. If two
					waves ripple up (peak) or down (trough) at the same time, they make a wave twice
					as big (constructive interference) &ndash; creating the bright bands. If one wave
					ripples up as the other ripples down, they cancel each other out (destructive
					interference) &ndash; creating the dark bands. Young also showed that different
					colours of light create different interference patterns. This demonstrated that
					the colour of light depends on its wavelength. For a century, Young’s
					double-slit experiment convinced scientists that light is a wave, not a
					particle. Then in 1905, Albert Einstein showed that light also behaves as if it
					were a stream of particles &ndash; it can behave like a wave and a particle. Such was
					the simplicity of Young’s experiment that, in 1961, German physicist Claus
					Jönsson used it to show that the subatomic particles electrons produce similar
					interference, so that they, too, must also be waves.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-404"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000208.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Here, light travels</span> through two slits

				that the world is made up of a range of basic substances, or chemical elements. But
				no one was certain what an element was. It was John Dalton, an English
				meteorologist, who, through his study of weather, saw that each element is made
				wholly of its own unique, identical atoms, and it is this special atom that
				distinguishes and defines an element. In developing the atomic theory of elements,
				Dalton established the basis of chemistry. The idea of atoms dates back to ancient
				Greece, but it had always been assumed that all atoms were identical. Dalton agreed with Isaac Newton who, a century earlier, had described the 
				atoms that made up the elements as “solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable
				particles”. Dalton’s breakthrough was to understand that each element is made from different atoms.</p><p class="calibre15">Dalton’s ideas originated in his study of the way in which air pressure affected
				how much water could be absorbed by air. He became convinced that air is a mixture
				of different gases. As he experimented, he observed that a given quantity of pure
				oxygen will take up less water vapour than the same amount of pure nitrogen, and he
				jumped to the remarkable conclusion that this is because oxygen atoms are bigger and
				heavier than nitrogen atoms.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-409"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000126.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"An inquiry into the relative weight of the ultimate particles of bodies is a

					be distinguished by differences in their weights. He saw that the atoms, or
					“ultimate particles”, of two or more elements combined to make compounds in very
					simple ratios, so he could work out the weight of each atom by the weight of
					each element involved in a compound. Very quickly, he worked out the atomic
					weight of each element then known.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen, Dalton realized, was the lightest gas, so he assigned it an atomic
					weight of 1. Because of the weight of oxygen that combined with hydrogen in
					water, he assigned oxygen an atomic weight of 7. However, there was a flaw in
					Dalton’s method, because he did not realize that atoms of the same element can
					combine. He always assumed that a compound of atoms &ndash; a molecule &ndash; had only one
					atom of each element. But Dalton’s work had put scientists on the right track,
					and within a decade Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro had devised a system of
					molecular proportions to calculate atomic weights correctly. Yet the basic idea
					of Dalton’s theory &ndash; that each element has its own unique-sized atoms &ndash; has
					proved to be true.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-411"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000045.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Dalton’s table</span> shows symbols and atomic

					addition to his meteorological studies, Dalton became fascinated by a condition
					he and his brother shared: colour blindness. His scientific paper on the subject
					gained him admission to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of
					which he was elected president in 1817. He wrote hundreds of scientific papers
					for the Society, including those about his atomic theory. The atomic theory was
					quickly accepted, and Dalton became a celebrity in his own lifetime &ndash; more than
					40,000 people attended his funeral in Manchester in 1844.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre14">1805 </b><i class="calibre11">Experimental Enquiry into the Proportion of the

					the Anning family of fossil collectors around Lyme Regis on the coast of
					southern England. Here, Jurassic-period limestone and shale strata outcrop in
					the cliffs, where they are eroded by the sea to reveal abundant remains of
					ancient marine organisms. In 1811, Joseph Anning found a 1.2m- (4ft-) long skull
					with a curiously elongated toothed beak. His sister Mary found the rest of the
					skeleton, which they sold for £23. Exhibited in London, this was the first
					entire skeleton of an extinct “monster of the abyss” and attracted a great deal
					of popular attention. It was identified as an extinct marine reptile and named
					an ichthyosaur, meaning “fish-lizard”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anning family went on to find more ichthyosaurs and the first complete
					specimen of another marine reptile, the plesiosaur, in addition to the first
					British specimen of a flying reptile, new fossil fish, and shellfish. Among the
					fish they found were cephalopods known as belemnites, some with the ink-sac
					preserved. The family, and especially Mary, had a talent for fossil-hunting.
					Although poor, Mary was literate and taught herself geology and anatomy, which
					made her a far more effective fossil-hunter. As Lady Harriet Sylvester observed
					in 1824, Mary Anning was “so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the
					moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong.” She became an
					authority on many kinds of fossils, especially coprolites &ndash; fossilized
					dung.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of life in ancient Dorset revealed by Anning’s fossils was one of
					a tropical coast where a wide variety of now-extinct animals thrived. In 1854,
					Anning’s fossils provided models for the first life-size reconstruction of an
					ichthyosaur, made for London’s Crystal Palace park by the sculptor Benjamin

					unorthodoxy, Anning received little formal recognition of her work in her

				the discovery of fossils of creatures unlike any alive today. In 1796, French
				naturalist Georges Cuvier had shown that fossilized elephant-like bones were
				markedly different in anatomy from the bones of modern elephants, and must come from
				extinct creatures now called mammoths and mastodons.</p><p class="calibre15">Cuvier explained the vanished creatures of the past as victims of catastrophes.
				Lamarck challenged this idea, and argued that life had “transmutated”, or evolved,
				gradually and continuously through time, developing from the simplest life forms to
				the most complex. A change in the environment, he suggested, could spur a change in
				the characteristics of an organism. Those changes could then be inherited through
				reproduction. Characteristics that were useful developed further; those that were
				not useful might disappear.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamarck believed characteristics were acquired during a creature’s life and passed
				on. Later, Darwin showed that changes occur because mutations at conception survive
				to be passed on through natural selection, and the idea of “acquired
				characteristics” was ridiculed. But recently, scientists have argued that the
				environment &ndash; chemicals, light, temperature, and food &ndash; can in fact alter genes and
				their expression.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"What nature does in the course of long periods we do every day when we

				The link had been suggested to him by the German chemist and physicist Johann
				Wilhelm Ritter, whom he had met in 1801. Already influenced by the philosopher
				Immanuel Kant’s idea that there is a unity to nature, Ørsted now investigated the
				possibility in earnest.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"It appears that the electric conflict is not restricted to the conducting

					convinced him that the current produced a circular magnetic field as it flowed

				how things cooled down by losing heat. His compatriot Jean-Baptiste Biot had
				imagined the spread of heat as “action at a distance”, in which it spreads by
				jumping from warm places to cool. Biot represented the heat flow in a solid as a
				series of slices, which allowed it to be studied with conventional equations showing
				the heat jumping from one slice to the next.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-441"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000134.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-442" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Temperature gradients</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Fourier looked at heat flow in an entirely different way.

					mathematically. He saw that every wave-like movement, which is what a
					temperature gradient is, can be approximated mathematically by adding together
					simpler waves, whatever the shape of the wave to be represented. The simpler
					waves that are to be added together are sines and cosines, derived from
					trigonometry, and can be written out mathematically as a series. These
					individual waves each move uniformly from a peak to a trough. Adding more and
					more of these simple waves together produces increasing complexity that can
					approximate any other type of wave. These infinite series are now called Fourier
					series.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourier published his idea in 1807, but it attracted criticism, and it was not
					until 1822 that his work was finally accepted. Continuing his study of heat, in
					1824, Fourier examined the difference between the heat that Earth gains from the
					Sun and the heat it loses to space. He realized that the reason Earth is
					pleasantly warm, considering how far it is from the Sun, is because gases in its
					atmosphere trap heat and stop it from being radiated back into space &ndash; the
					phenomenon now called the greenhouse effect.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Fourier analysis is applied not only to heat transfer but also to a

				fundamental difference existed between the chemicals involved in living things and
				all other chemicals. These unique, “organic” chemicals, Berzelius argued, could only
				be assembled by living things themselves and, once broken down, could not be remade
				artificially. His idea chimed with the prevailing theory known as “vitalism”, which
				held that life was special and that living things were endowed with a “life force”
				beyond the understanding of chemists. So it came as a surprise when the pioneering
				experiments of a German chemist called Friedrich Wöhler showed that organic
				chemicals are not unique at all, but behave according to the same basic rules as all
				chemicals.</p><p class="calibre15">We now know that organic chemicals comprise a multitude of molecules based on the
				element carbon. These carbon-based molecules are indeed essential components of
				life, but many can be synthesized from inorganic chemicals &ndash; as Wöhler
				discovered.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-448"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000286.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-449" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Chemistry rivals</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Wöhler’s breakthrough came about because of a scientific rivalry. In the early
					1820s, Wöhler and fellow chemist Justus von Liebig both came up with identical
					chemical analyses for what seemed to be two very different substances &ndash; silver
					fulminate, which is explosive, and silver cyanate, which is not. Both men
					assumed that the other had got his results wrong, but after corresponding, they
					found they were both right. This group of compounds led chemists to realize that
					substances are defined not just by the number and kinds of atoms in the molecule
					but also by the atoms’ arrangement. The same formula may apply to different
					structures with different properties &ndash; these different structures were later
					named isomers by Berzelius.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wöhler and Liebig went on to forge a brilliant partnership, but it was Wöhler
					alone who, in 1828, stumbled upon the truth about organic chemicals.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-450"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000016.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Widely used in fertilizers</span>, urea is rich in

					ammonium cyanate. Instead, he got a white substance that had different
					properties from ammonium cyanate. The same powder appeared when he mixed lead
					cyanate with ammonium hydroxide. Analysis showed the white powder to be urea &ndash;
					an organic substance that is a key component of urine, and has the same chemical
					formula as ammonium cyanate. According to Berzelius’s theory, it could be made
					only by living things &ndash; yet Wöhler had synthesized it from inorganic chemicals.
					Wöhler wrote to Berzelius: “I must tell you that I can make urea without the use
					of kidneys”, explaining that urea was in fact an isomer of ammonium
					cyanate.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of Wöhler’s discovery took many years to sink in. Even so, it
					showed the way for the development of modern organic chemistry, which not only
					reveals how all living things depend on chemical processes, but enables the
					artificial synthesis of valuable organic chemicals on a commercial scale. In
					1907, a synthetic polymer called Bakelite was produced from two such chemicals
					and ushered in the “Age of Plastics” that shaped the modern world.</p></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-452"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">FRIEDRICH WÖHLER</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-453"><img alt="" src="images/000402.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Born in Eschersheim, near Frankfurt in Germany, Friedrich Wöhler trained in

					to Germany, he embarked on a remarkable and varied career in chemical research
					and innovation.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the first artificial synthesis of an organic substance, Wöhler’s many
					discoveries &ndash; often made with Justus von Liebig &ndash; included aluminium, beryllium,
					yttrium, titanium, and silicon. He also helped to develop the idea of “radicals”
					&ndash; basic molecular groups from which other substances are built. Although later
					disproved, this theory paved the way for today’s understanding of how molecules
					assemble. In later years, Wöhler became an authority on the chemistry of
					meteorites and helped set up a factory for purifying nickel.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre14">1830 </b><i class="calibre11">Summary of Inorganic Chemistry</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre14">1840 </b><i class="calibre11">Summary of Organic Chemistry</i></p></div></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre17"><b class="calibre14">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-103" class="calibre3">Antoine Lavoisier</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-80" class="calibre3">John Dalton</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-12" class="calibre3">Jöns Jakob Berzelius</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-92" class="calibre3">Leo Baekeland</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-27" class="calibre3">August Kekulé</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				also leave behind erratics &ndash; boulders that have been carried long distances by the
				ice. These can usually be identified because their composition is different from the
				rocks on which they lie. Many erratics are too large to have been moved by rivers,
				which is the usual way that rocks are carried across a landscape. A rock of a
				different kind from rocks around it, therefore, is a tell-tale sign that a glacier
				once passed by. Another is the presence of moraines in valleys. These are piles of
				boulders that were pushed aside when the glacier was growing, and left behind when

					argued that rocks were moved by repeated flooding. Floods could explain the
					“boulder drift” (the sands, clays, and gravels that included erratic boulders)
					that overlay much of the bedrock of Europe. The material might have been

					remnants of ice sheets that had at one time covered most of the globe. But
					before he published his theory Agassiz wanted to convince others. He had met
					William Buckland, a prominent English geologist, while excavating fossil fishes
					in the Old Red Sandstone rocks in the Alps. When Agassiz showed him the evidence
					for his theory of an ice age, Buckland was convinced, and in 1840 the two men
					toured Scotland to look for evidence of glaciation there. After the tour,
					Agassiz presented his ideas to the Geological Society of London. Although he had
					convinced Buckland and Charles Lyell &ndash; two of the leading geologists of the day
					&ndash; the other members of the society were unimpressed. A near-global glaciation
					seemed no more probable than a global flood. However, the idea of ice ages
					gradually gained acceptance, and today there is evidence from many different

					<i class="calibre11">logos</i>, meaning study or discourse. But it is
				an earlier German polymath named Alexander von Humboldt who is regarded as the
				pioneer of modern ecological thinking.</p><p class="calibre15">Through extensive expeditions and writings, Humboldt promoted a new approach to
				science. He sought to understand nature as a unified whole, by inter-relating all of
				the physical sciences and employing the latest scientific equipment, exhaustive
				observation, and meticulous analysis of data on an unprecedented scale.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-470"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000125.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-471" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The crocodile’s teeth</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Although Humboldt’s holistic approach was new, the concept of ecology

					inter-dependence, technically known as mutualism, he describes crocodiles on the
					River Nile in Egypt opening their mouths to allow birds to pick their teeth
					clean.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A century later, observations by the Greek philosopher Aristotle and his pupil
					Theophrastus on species’ migration, distribution, and behaviour provided an
					early version of the concept of the ecological niche &ndash; the particular place in
					nature that shapes and is shaped by a species’ way of life. Theophrastus studied
					and wrote extensively on plants, realizing the importance of climate and soils
					to their growth and distribution. Their ideas influenced natural philosophy for

					tradition that reacted to rationalism by insisting on the value of senses,
					observation, and experience in understanding the world as a whole. Like his
					contemporaries, the poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller,
					Humboldt promoted the idea of the unity (or <i class="calibre11">Gestalt</i> in German) of nature &ndash; and of natural philosophy and the
					humanities. His studies ranged from anatomy and astronomy to mineralogy and
					botany, commerce, and linguistics, and provided him with the breadth of
					knowledge necessary for his exploration of the natural world beyond the confines
					of Europe.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As Humboldt explained, “The sight of exotic plants, even of dried specimens in
					a herbarium, fired my imagination and I longed to see the tropical vegetation in
					southern countries with my own eyes.” His five-year exploration of Latin America
					with the French botanist Aimé Bonpland was his most important expedition.
					Setting out in June 1799, he declared, “I shall collect plants and fossils, and
					make astronomical observations with the best of instruments. Yet this is not the
					main purpose of my journey. I shall endeavour to discover how nature’s forces
					act upon one another and in what manner the geographic environment exerts its
					influence on animals and plants. In short, I must find out about the harmony in
					nature.” And he did just that.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among many other projects, Humboldt measured ocean water temperature and
					suggested the use of “iso-lines”, or isothermal lines, to join points of equal
					temperature as a means of characterizing and mapping the global environment,
					especially the climate, and then comparing the climatic conditions in various
					countries.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Humboldt was also one of the first scientists to study how physical conditions
					&ndash; such as climate, altitude, latitude, and soils &ndash; affected the distribution of
					life. With Bonpland’s assistance, he mapped the changes in flora and fauna
					between sea level and high altitude in the Andes. In 1805, the year after his
					return from the Americas, he published a now-celebrated work on the geography of
					the area, summarizing the inter-connectedness of nature and illustrating the
					altitudinal zones of vegetation. Years later, in 1851, he showed the global
					application of these zones by comparing the Andean zones with those of the
					European Alps, Pyrenees, Lapland, Tenerife, and the Asian Himalayas.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-474" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Defining ecology</h2></div><p class="calibre12">When Haeckel coined the word “ecology”, he too was following in the tradition
					of viewing a <i class="calibre11">Gestalt</i> (unity) of the living
					and inanimate world. An enthusiastic evolutionist, he was inspired by Charles
					Darwin, whose publication of <i class="calibre11">On the Origin of
						Species</i> in 1859 banished the notion of Earth as an immutable
					world. Haeckel questioned the role of natural selection, but believed that the
					environment played an important role in both evolution and ecology.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the 19th century, the first university course in ecology was
					being taught by the Danish botanist Eugenius Warming, who also wrote the first
					ecology textbook <i class="calibre11">Plantesamfund</i> (<i class="calibre11">Plant Ecology</i>) in 1895. From Humboldt’s pioneering
					work, Warming developed the global geographical subdivision of plant
					distribution known as biomes, such as the tropical rainforest biome, which are
					largely based on the interaction of plants with the environment, especially
					climate.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-475" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Individuals and community</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Early in the 20th century, the modern definition of ecology developed as the
					scientific study of the interactions that determine the distribution and
					abundance of organisms. These interactions include an organism’s environment,
					encompassing all those factors that influence it &ndash; both biotic (living
					organisms) and abiotic (non-living factors such as soil, water, air,
					temperature, and sunlight). The scope of modern ecology ranges from the
					individual organism to populations of individuals of the same species, and the
					community, made up of populations that share a particular environment.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the basic terms and concepts of ecology came from the work of several
					pioneer ecologists in the first few decades of the 20th century. The formal
					concept of the biological community was first developed in 1916 by the American
					botanist Frederic Clements. He believed that the plants of a given area develop
					a succession of communities over time, from an initial pioneer community to an
					optimal climax community within which successive communities of different
					species adjust to one another to form a tightly integrated and interdependent
					unit, similar to the organs of a body. Clements’ metaphor of the community as a
					“complex organism” was criticized at first but influenced later thinking.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of further ecological integration at a higher level than the
					community was introduced in 1935 with the concept of the ecosystem, developed by
					the English botanist Arthur Tansley. An ecosystem consists of both living and
					non-living elements. Their interaction forms a stable unit with a sustaining
					flow of energy from the environmental to the living part (through the food
					chain) and can operate on all scales, from a puddle to an ocean or the whole
					planet.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of animal communities by the English zoologist Charles Elton led him
					to develop in 1927 the concept of the food chain and food cycle, subsequently
					known as the “food web”. A food chain is formed by the transfer of energy
					through an ecosystem from primary producers (such as green plants on land)
					through a series of consuming organisms. Elton also recognized that particular
					groups of organisms occupied certain niches in the food chain for periods of
					time. Elton’s niches include not only the habitats but also the resources upon
					which the occupying organisms rely for sustenance. The dynamics of energy
					transfer through trophic (feeding) levels were studied by the American
					ecologists Raymond Lindeman and Robert MacArthur, whose mathematical models
					helped change ecology from primarily a descriptive science into an experimental
					one.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-476"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000375.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">A food chain</span> transfers energy from

					concerns, stimulated by powerful advocates such as the American marine biologist
					Rachel Carson. Her 1962 book <i class="calibre11">Silent Spring</i>
					documented the harmful effects on the environment of man-made chemicals such as
					the pesticide DDT. The first image of Earth seen from space, taken by <i class="calibre11">Apollo 8</i> astronauts in 1968, awakened public
					awareness of the planet’s fragility. In 1969, the organizations Friends of the
					Earth and Greenpeace were established, with the mission to “ensure the ability
					of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity”. Environmental protection,
					along with clean and renewable energy, organic foods, recycling, and
					sustainability, were all on the political agenda in both North America and

				theory that light is a pressure wave, moving in a mysterious fluid called aether.
				Huygens thought of light as a longitudinal wave, and predicted that the wave would
				travel more slowly through glass or water than through air. In 1704, Isaac Newton
				published his theory of light as a stream of “corpuscles”, or particles. Newton’s
				explanation for refraction &ndash; the bending of a beam of light as it passes from one
				transparent material to another &ndash; assumed that light travels faster after it passes
				from air into water.</p><p class="calibre15">Estimates for the speed of light relied on astronomical phenomena, showing how
				fast light travels through space. The first terrestrial measurement was carried out
				by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849. A beam of light was shone through a
				gap between the teeth of a rotating cogwheel. That light was then reflected by a
				mirror that was positioned 8km (5 miles) away, and passed back through the next gap
				between the wheel’s teeth. Taking the precise speed of rotation that allowed this to
				happen, together with time and distance, Fizeau calculated the speed of light as
				313,000km/s (194,489 miles/s).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-483"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000117.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"Above all we must be accurate, and it is an obligation which we intend to

					rotating mirror would only be reflected towards the distant mirror when the
					rotating mirror was at the correct angle. Light returning from the fixed mirror
					was reflected by the rotating mirror again, but as this mirror had moved while
					the light was travelling, it was not reflected directly back towards the source.
					The speed of light could now be calculated from the angle between the light
					going to and from the rotating mirror and the speed of rotation of the
					mirror.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of light in water could be measured by putting a tube of water in
					the apparatus between the rotating and stationary mirrors. Using this apparatus,
					Foucault established that light travelled more slowly in water than in air. As
					such, he argued, light could not be a particle, and the experiment was viewed at
					the time as a refutation of Newton’s theory of corpuscles. Foucault refined his
					apparatus further, and in 1862, measured the speed of light in air as
					298,000km/s (185,168 miles/s) &ndash; remarkably close to today’s value of 299,792km/s

					Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac beetle. It is a natural polymer
					that was used to give furniture and other objects a tough, shiny coat. Baekeland
					found that by treating phenol resin made from coal tar with formaldehyde, he
					could make a kind of shellac. In 1907, he added various kinds of powder to this
					resin and found that he could create a remarkable hard, mouldable

				before him, Darwin proposed that species of organisms change, or evolve, through
				time. His great contribution was to show how evolution took place by a process he
				termed natural selection. He laid out his central idea in his book <i class="calibre11">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the
					Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i>, published in
				London in 1859. Darwin described the book as “one long argument”.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-504"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000255.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-505" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">“Confessing a murder”</h2></div><p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre11">On the Origin of Species</i> met with academic
					and popular opposition. It made no mention of religious doctrine, which insisted
					that species were indeed fixed and immutable and designed by God. But gradually
					the ideas in the book changed the scientific perspective on the natural world.
					Its core notion forms the basis for all modern biology, providing a simple, but
					immensely powerful, explanation of life forms both past and present.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin was acutely aware of the potential blasphemy in his work during the
					decades he spent writing it. Fifteen years before publication, he explained to
					his confidant, the botanist Joseph Hooker, that his theory required no God or
					unchanging species: “At last gleams of light have come, &amp; I am almost
					convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is
					like confessing a murder) immutable.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin’s approach to evolution, like the rest of his wide-ranging work in
					natural history, was cautious, careful, and deliberate. He proceeded step by
					step, amassing great quantities of evidence along the way. Over almost 30 years,
					he integrated his extensive knowledge of fossils, geology, plants, animals, and
					selective breeding, with concepts from demography, economics, and many other
					fields. The resulting theory of evolution by natural selection is regarded as
					one of the greatest scientific advances ever.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BCE; it is a process that

					Some regarded them as naturally formed rock shapes, and nothing to do with
					living organisms. Others saw them as the handiwork of the Creator, put on Earth
					to test believers. Or they thought that they were the remains of organisms still
					alive somewhere in the world, since God had created living things in
					perfection.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1796, the French naturalist Georges Cuvier recognized that certain fossils,
					such as those of mammoths or giant sloths, were the remains of animals that had
					become extinct. He reconciled this with his religious belief by invoking
					catastrophes such as the Flood depicted in the Bible. Each disaster swept away a
					whole assortment of living things; God then replenished Earth with new species.
					Between each disaster, each species remained fixed and immutable. This theory
					was known as “catastrophism” and it became widely known following the
					publication of Cuvier’s <i class="calibre11">Preliminary Discourse</i>
					in 1813.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the time Cuvier was writing, various ideas based on evolution were
					already in circulation. Erasmus Darwin, the free-thinking grandfather of
					Charles, proposed an early, idiosyncratic theory. More influential were the
					ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, professor of zoology at France’s National Museum
					of Natural History. His <i class="calibre11">Philosophie
						Zoologique</i> of 1809 articulated what was perhaps the first
					reasoned theory of evolution. He theorized that living beings evolved from
					simple beginnings through increasingly sophisticated stages, due to a
					“complexifying force”. They faced environmental challenges on their body
					physiques, and from this came the idea of use and disuse in an individual: “More
					frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and
					enlarges that organ…while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly
					weakens and deteriorates it…until it finally disappears.” The organ’s greater
					power was then passed to offspring, a phenomenon that became known as
					inheritance of acquired characteristics.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his theory came to be largely discounted, Lamarck was later praised
					by Darwin for having opened up the possibility that change did not occur as a
					result of what Darwin disparagingly termed “miraculous interposition”.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-507"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000041.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">By studying</span> the fossil record, Georges

					round-the-world voyage aboard the survey ship HMS <i class="calibre11">Beagle</i>, in 1831&ndash;36, under captain Robert FitzRoy. As expedition
					scientist, Darwin was charged with collecting all manner of fossil, plant, and
					animal specimens, and sending them back to Britain from each port of
					call.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This epic voyage opened the eyes of the young Darwin, still only in his
					twenties, to the incredible variety of life. Wherever the <i class="calibre11">Beagle</i> docked, Darwin keenly observed all aspects
					of nature. In 1835, he described and collected a group of small, insignificant
					birds on the Galápagos Islands, a Pacific Ocean archipelago 900km (560 miles)
					west of Ecuador. He thought there were nine species, six being finches.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;After his return to England, Darwin organized his mass of data and oversaw a
					multi-volume, multi-author report, <i class="calibre11">The Zoology of the
						Voyage of HMS</i> Beagle. In the volume on birds, the renowned
					ornithologist John Gould declared that there were in fact 13 species in Darwin’s
					specimens, all of them finches. Within the group, however, were birds with
					differently shaped beaks, adapted to different diets.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own, bestselling account of his adventure, <i class="calibre11">The
						Voyage of the</i> Beagle, Darwin wrote, “Seeing this gradation and
					diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one
					might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago,
					one species had been taken and modified for different ends.” This was one of the
					first clear, public formulations of where his thoughts on evolution were
					heading.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-509"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000196.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This giant tortoise</span> is only found on

					trigger for his work on evolution. In fact, his thoughts had been mounting
					throughout the <i class="calibre11">Beagle</i>’s voyage, and
					especially during his visit to the Galápagos. He was fascinated by the giant
					tortoises he saw, and by the way the shapes of their shells differed subtly from
					island to island. He was also impressed by the species of mockingbirds. They,
					too, varied between the islands, yet they also had similarities not only among
					themselves, but with species that lived on the South American mainland.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin suggested that the various mockingbirds might have evolved from a
					common ancestor that had somehow crossed the Pacific from the mainland; then
					each group of birds evolved by adapting to the particular environment on each
					island and its available food. Observing giant tortoises, Falkland Island foxes,
					and other species supported these early conclusions. But Darwin was sensitive
					about where such blasphemous ideas would lead: “Such facts would undermine the
					stability of species.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"Natural selection is the…principle by which slight variation (of a trait),

					Charles Lyell’s <i class="calibre11">Principles of Geology</i>. Lyell
					argued against Cuvier’s catastrophism history and his theory of fossil
					formation. Instead, he adapted the ideas of geological renewal put forward by
					James Hutton into a theory known as “uniformitarianism”. Earth was continually
					being formed, altered, and reformed over immense time periods by processes such
					as wave erosion and volcanic upheaval that were the same as those happening
					today. There was no need to invoke disastrous interventions by God.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyell’s ideas transformed the way Darwin interpreted the landscape formations,
					rocks, and fossils he found on his explorations, which he now saw “through
					Lyell’s eyes”. However, while he was in South America, volume two of <i class="calibre11">Principles of Geology</i> arrived. In it, Lyell
					rejected ideas of gradual evolution of plants and animals, including Lamarck’s
					theories. Instead, he invoked the concept of “centres of Creation” to explain
					species’ diversity and distribution. Although Darwin admired Lyell as a
					geologist, he had to discount this latest concept as the evidence for evolution
					mounted.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another piece of the jigsaw was revealed in 1838 when Darwin read <i class="calibre11">An Essay on the Principle of Population</i> by the
					English demographer Thomas Malthus, which had been published 40 years earlier.
					Malthus described how human populations can increase in an exponential way, with
					the potential to double after one generation of 25 years, then double again in
					the next generation, and so on. However, food supplies could not expand in the
					same way, and the result was a struggle for existence. Malthus’s ideas were one
					of the main inspirations for Darwin’s theory of evolution.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-512"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000202.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The finches of the Galápagos</span> have

					withdrew from the public eye.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1842, Darwin moved to the peace and quiet of Down House in Kent, where he
					continued to amass evidence to support his theory of evolution. Scientists
					around the world sent him specimens and data. He studied the domestication of
					animals and plants, and the role of selective breeding, or artificial selection,
					especially in pigeons. In 1855, he started breeding varieties of <i class="calibre11">Columbia livia</i>, or rock doves, and they would
					feature prominently in the first two chapters in <i class="calibre11">On the
						Origin of Species</i>.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his work on pigeons, Darwin began to understand the extent and
					relevance of variation among individuals. He rejected the accepted wisdom that
					environmental factors were responsible for such differences, insisting that
					reproduction was the cause, with variation somehow inherited from parents. He
					added this to the ideas of Malthus and applied them to the natural world.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later, in his autobiography, Darwin recalled his reaction when he first
					read Malthus back in 1838. “Being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for
					existence…it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable
					variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.
					The result of this would be the formation of new species…I had at last got a
					theory by which to work.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing more about the role of variation, by 1856 Darwin the pigeon breeder
					could imagine not humans but nature doing the choosing. From the term
					“artificial selection” he derived “natural selection”.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-514" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Jolt into action</h2></div><p class="calibre12">On 18 June 1858, Darwin received a short essay by a young British naturalist
					named Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace described a flash of insight in which he
					had suddenly understood how evolution occurred, and asked Darwin for his
					opinion. Darwin was startled to read that Wallace’s insight replicated almost
					exactly the same ideas he himself had been working on for more than 20
					years.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried about precedence, Darwin consulted Charles Lyell. They agreed to a
					joint presentation of Darwin’s and Wallace’s papers at the Linnaean Society in
					London on 1 July 1858. Neither author would attend in person. The audience’s
					response was polite, with no outcry about blasphemy. Encouraged, Darwin now
					finished his book. Published on 24 November 1859, <i class="calibre11">On the
						Origin of Species</i> sold out on its first day.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-515" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Darwin’s theory</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Darwin states that species are not immutable. They change, or evolve, and the
					main mechanism for this change is natural selection. The process relies on two
					factors. First, more offspring are born than can survive when faced with the
					challenges of climate, food supply, competition, predators, and diseases; this
					leads to a struggle for existence. Second, there is variation, sometimes tiny
					but nonetheless present, among the offspring within a species. For evolution,
					these variations must fulfil two criteria. One: they should have some effect on
					the struggle to survive and breed, that is, they should help to confer
					reproductive success. Two: they should be inherited, or passed to offspring,
					where they would confer the same evolutionary advantage.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin describes evolution as a slow and gradual process. As a population of
					organisms adapts to a new environment, it becomes a new species, different from
					its ancestors. Meanwhile, those ancestors may remain the same, or they may
					evolve in response to their own changing environment, or they may lose the
					struggle for survival and become extinct.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-516"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000150.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Alfred Russel Wallace</span>, like Darwin,

					by natural selection, most scientists soon accepted Darwin’s concept of
					“survival of the fittest”. Darwin’s book was careful to avoid any mention of
					humans in connection with evolution, apart from the single sentence, “Light will
					be shed on the origin of man, and his history”. However, there were protests
					from the Church, and the clear implication that humans had evolved from other
					animals was ridiculed in many quarters.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, as ever avoiding the limelight, remained engrossed in his studies at
					Down House. As controversy mounted, numerous scientists sprang to his defence.
					The biologist Thomas Henry Huxley was vociferous in supporting the theory &ndash; and
					arguing the case for human descent from apes &ndash; and dubbed himself “Darwin’s
					bulldog”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mechanism by which inheritance occurred &ndash; how and why some traits
					are passed on, others not &ndash; remained a mystery. Coincidentally, at the same time
					that Darwin published his book, a monk named Gregor Mendel was experimenting
					with pea plants in Brno (in the present-day Czech Republic). His work on
					inherited characteristics, reported in 1865, formed the basis of genetics, but
					was overlooked by mainstream science until the 20th century, when new
					discoveries in genetics were integrated into evolutionary theory, providing a
					mechanism for heredity. Darwin’s principle of natural selection remains key to
					understanding the process.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-518"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000357.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This cartoon ridiculing</span> Darwin appeared

				to his theory of evolution by natural selection. Yet FitzRoy was a remarkable
				scientist in his own right.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;FitzRoy was just 26 when he sailed from England with Darwin in 1831. Yet he had
				already served more than a decade at sea, and had studied at the Royal Naval College
				at Greenwich, where he was the first candidate to pass the lieutenant’s exam with
				perfect marks. He had even commanded the <i class="calibre11">Beagle</i>
				on an earlier survey trip around South America, where the importance of studying the

					forecasting came from naval officers. Knowing what weather lay ahead was crucial
					in the days of sailing ships. Missing a good wind could have huge financial
					consequences &ndash; and being caught at sea in a storm could be disastrous.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Two naval officers in particular had already made significant contributions.
					One was Irish mariner Francis Beaufort, who created a standard scale showing the
					wind speed or “force” linked to particular conditions at sea, and later on land.
					This allowed the severity of storms to be recorded and compared methodically for
					the first time. The scale ranged from 1, indicating “light air” to 12,
					“hurricane”. The first time the Beaufort scale was used was by FitzRoy on the
						<i class="calibre11">Beagle</i> voyage. Thereafter it became
					standard in all naval ships’ logs.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another naval weather pioneer was American Matthew Maury. He created wind and
					current charts for the North Atlantic, which resulted in dramatic improvements
					for sailing times and certainty. He also advocated the creation of an
					international sea and land weather service, and led a conference in Brussels in
					1853 that began to coordinate observations on conditions at sea from all around
					the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-525"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000393.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Before FitzRoy</span> began his weather
							reporting systems, mariners had already observed that winds form

					British contribution at the Meteorological Office. But with characteristic zeal
					and insight, FitzRoy went much further than his brief. He began to see that a
					system of simultaneous weather observations from around the world could not only
					reveal hitherto undiscovered patterns, but actually be used to make weather
					predictions.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Observers already knew that in tropical hurricanes, for instance, the winds
					blow in a circular or “cyclonic” pattern around a central area of low air
					pressure or “depression”. It was soon realized that most of the large storms
					that blow in the mid-latitudes show this cyclonic depression shape. So the
					direction of the wind gives a clue as to whether the storm is approaching or
					receding.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1850s, better records of weather events, and the use of the new
					electric telegraph to communicate over long distances, almost instantly revealed
					that cyclonic storms, which form over land, move eastwards. In contrast,
					hurricanes (tropical North Atlantic storms) form over water and migrate
					westwards. So in North America when a storm hit one place far inland, a
					telegraph could be sent to warn places further east that a storm was on its way.
					Observers already knew that a drop in air pressure on the barometer gave warning
					of a storm to come. The telegraph allowed such readings to be relayed rapidly
					over great distances and therefore gave warnings much further in advance.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-527"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000003.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">FitzRoy coloured</span> his daily “synoptic”

					observations of air pressure, temperature, and wind speed and direction taken at
					set times from widely spread locations. When these observations were sent
					instantly by telegraph to his coordinating office in London, he could build up a
					picture or “synopsis” of weather conditions over a vast area.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This synopsis gave such a complete picture of the weather conditions that it
					not only revealed current weather patterns on a wide scale, it also enabled
					weather patterns to be tracked. FitzRoy realized that weather patterns were
					repeated. From this, it was clear to him that he could work out how weather
					patterns may develop over a short time in the future, from how they have
					developed in the past. This provides the basis for a detailed forecast of the
					weather at any and every point within the region covered. This was a remarkable
					insight that formed the basis of modern forecasting.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation figures alone were enough, but FitzRoy also used them to
					create the first modern meteorological chart, the “synoptic” chart that revealed
					the swirling shapes of cyclonic storms as clearly as satellite pictures do
					today. FitzRoy’s ideas were summed up in his book, entitled simply <i class="calibre11">The Weather Book</i> (1863), which introduced the word
					“forecast” and laid out the principles of modern forecasting for the first
					time.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A crucial step was to divide the British Isles into weather areas, collate
					current weather conditions, and use past weather data from each area to help
					make forecasts. FitzRoy recruited a network of observers, particularly at sea
					and in ports in the British Isles. He also obtained data from France and Spain,
					where the idea of constant weather observation was catching on. Within a few
					years, his network was operating so effectively that he could get a daily
					snapshot of weather patterns right across Western Europe. Patterns in the
					weather were revealed so clearly that he could forecast how it was likely to
					change over the next day at least &ndash; and so produce the first national
					forecasts.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"I try, by my warnings of probable bad weather, to avoid the need for a

					was worked out. Instantly, forecasts were despatched to <i class="calibre11">The Times</i> newspaper to be published for all to read. The first
					weather forecast was published by the newspaper on 1 August 1861.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;FitzRoy set up a system of signalling cones in highly visible places at ports
					to warn if a storm was on the way and from which direction. This system worked
					so well that it saved countless lives.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some shipowners, however, resented the system when their captains began to
					delay setting sail if warned of a storm. There were also problems disseminating
					the forecasts in time. It took 24 hours to distribute the newspaper, so FitzRoy
					had to make forecasts for not just one day ahead but two &ndash; otherwise the weather
					would have happened by the time people read his forecasts. He was aware that
					longer-range forecasts were far more unreliable, and was frequently exposed to
					ridicule, particularly when <i class="calibre11">The Times</i>
					disassociated itself from mistakes.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-530" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">FitzRoy’s legacy</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Faced with a barrage of ridicule and criticism from vested interests, the
					forecasts were suspended and FitzRoy committed suicide in 1865. When it was
					discovered that he had spent his fortune on his research at the Meteorological
					Office, the government compensated his family. But within a few years, pressure
					from mariners ensured that his storm warning system was again in widespread use.
					Picking up the detailed forecasts and storm warnings for particular shipping
					areas is now an essential part of every mariner’s day.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As communications technology improved and added ever more detail to the

				living things by a process of reproduction. This may seem self-evident today, but
				when the basic principles of biology were in their infancy, many scientists adhered
				to a notion called “abiogenesis” &ndash; the idea that life could spontaneously generate
				itself. Long after Aristotle claimed that living organisms could emerge from
				decaying matter, some even believed in methods that purported to make creatures from
				inanimate objects. In the 17th century, for instance, Flemish physician Jan Baptista
				von Helmont wrote that sweaty underwear and some wheat grain left in a jar in the
				open would spawn adult mice. Spontaneous generation had its advocates until well
				into the 19th century. In 1859, however, a French microbiologist named Louis Pasteur
				devised a clever experiment that disproved it. In the course of his investigations,
				he also proved that infections were caused by living microbes &ndash; germs.</p><p class="calibre15">Before Pasteur, the link between disease or decay and organisms had been suspected
				but never substantiated. Until microscopes could prove otherwise, the notion that
				there were such things as tiny living entities that were invisible to the naked eye
				seemed fanciful. In 1546, Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro described “seeds of
				contagion”, and came close to the truth of the matter. But he fell short of
				explicitly stating that they were living, reproducible things, and his theory made
				little impact. Instead, people believed that infectious disease was caused by
				“miasma” &ndash; or noxious air &ndash; that came from rotting matter. Without a clear idea of
				the nature of germs as microbes, no one could properly appreciate that the
				transmission of infection and the propagation of life were in effect two sides of
				the same coin.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-537"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000345.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"In the field of experimentation, chance favours only the prepared mind."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Louis Pasteur</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-538" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">First scientific observations</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In the 17th century, scientists attempted to trace the origins of larger
					creatures by studying reproduction. In 1661, English physician William Harvey
					(known for his discovery of the circulation of blood) dissected a pregnant deer
					in an effort to discover the origin of a foetus, and proclaimed “<i class="calibre11">Omne vivum ex ovo”</i> &ndash; all life from eggs. He failed
					to find the deer’s egg in question, but it was at least a hint of things to
					come.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Italian physician Francesco Redi was the first to offer experimental evidence
					for the impossibility of spontaneous generation &ndash; at least in so far as
					creatures visible to the human eye were concerned. In 1668, he studied the
					process by which meat becomes riddled with maggots. He covered one piece of meat
					with parchment and left another exposed. Only the exposed meat became infected
					with maggots, because it attracted flies, which deposited their eggs on it. Redi
					repeated the experiment with cheesecloth &ndash; which absorbed the meat’s odour and
					attracted flies &ndash; and showed that flies’ eggs taken from the cheesecloth could
					then be used to “seed” uninfected meat with maggots. Redi argued that maggots
					could only arise from flies, rather than spontaneously. However, the
					significance of Redi’s experiment was not appreciated, and even Redi himself did
					not fully reject abiogenesis, believing that it did occur in certain
					circumstances.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the first makers and users of the microscope for detailed scientific
					study, Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek showed that some living things
					were so small that they could not be seen with the naked eye &ndash; and also that the
					reproduction of larger creatures depended upon similar microscopic living
					entities, such as sperm.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the idea of abiogenesis was so deeply entrenched in the minds of
					scientists that many still thought that these microscopic organisms were too
					small to contain reproductive organs and must therefore arise spontaneously. In
					1745, English naturalist John Needham set out to prove it. He knew that heat
					could kill microbes, so he boiled some mutton gravy in a flask &ndash; thereby killing
					its microbes &ndash; and then allowed it to cool. After observing the broth for a
					time, he saw that the microbes had come back. He concluded that they had arisen
					spontaneously from the sterilized broth. Two decades later, Italian physiologist
					Lazzaro Spallanzani repeated Needham’s experiment, but showed that the microbes
					did not grow back if he removed air from the flask. Spallanzani thought that the
					air had “seeded” the broth, but his critics proposed instead that air was

					Spallanzani’s experiments can be easily explained. Although heat does indeed
					kill most microbes, some bacteria, for example, can survive by turning into
					dormant, heat-resistant spores. And most microbes, as with most life, need
					oxygen from the air in order to derive energy from their nutrition. Most
					importantly, however, these sorts of experiments were always vulnerable to
					contamination &ndash; microscopic air-borne microbes can easily colonize a growth
					medium, even after a brief exposure to the atmosphere. So in fact, neither of
					these experiments had addressed conclusively the question of abiogenisis, one
					way or another.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-539"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000360.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This drawing</span> by Francesco Redi shows

					to became possible to settle the matter. Louis Pasteur’s experiment demonstrated
					that there were microbes suspended in air, ready to infect any exposed surface.
					First, he filtered air through cotton. Then he analysed the contaminated cotton
					filters and examined the trapped dust with a microscope. He found it to be
					teeming with the sort of microbes that had been linked with the decay and
					spoilage of food. It looked as though infection was caused when microbes
					literally fell out of the air. This was the critical information Pasteur needed
					to succeed in the next step, when he took up a challenge laid down by the French
					Academy of Sciences &ndash; to disprove the idea of spontaneous generation once and
					for all.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;For his experiment, Pasteur boiled nutrient-rich broth &ndash; just as Needham and
					Spallanzani had done a century before &ndash; but this time made a critical
					modification to the flask. He heated the flask’s neck to soften the glass, then
					drew the glass outwards and downwards to form a tube in the shape of a swan’s
					neck. When the set-up had cooled, the tube was part-way directed downwards so
					that microbes could not fall onto the broth, even though the temperature was now
					suitable for their growth and there was plentiful oxygen as the tube
					communicated with the outside air. The only way microbes could grow back in the
					flask was spontaneously &ndash; and this did not happen.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As final proof that microbes needed to contaminate the broth from the air,
					Pasteur repeated the experiment, but snapped off the swan-necked tube. The broth
					became infected: he had finally disproved spontaneous generation, and had shown
					that all life came from life. It was clear that microbes could no more
					spontaneously appear in a flask of broth than mice could appear in a dirty
					jar.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-541"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000261.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Pasteur’s</span> swan-neck experiment proved

					lecture entitled “biogenesis and abiogenesis”. It was a crushing blow to the
					last devotees of spontaneous generation, and marked the birth of a new biology
					solidly founded on the disciplines of cell theory, biochemistry, and genetics.
					By the 1880s, German physician Robert Koch had shown that the disease anthrax
					was transmitted by infectious bacteria.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, nearly a century after Huxley’s address, abiogenesis would once
					again focus the minds of a new generation of scientists as they began to ask
					questions about the origin of the very first life on Earth. In 1953, American
					chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey sent electrical sparks through a mix of
					water, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen to simulate the atmospheric conditions at
					the dawn of life on Earth. Within weeks, they had created amino acids &ndash; the
					building blocks of proteins and key chemical constituents of living cells.
					Miller and Urey’s experiment triggered a resurgence of work aimed at showing
					that living organisms can emerge from non-living matter, but this time
					scientists were equipped with the tools of biochemistry and an understanding of
					processes that took place billions of years ago.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"I observe facts alone; I seek but the scientific conditions under which

				combine with each other in whole-number proportions. Jöns Jakob Berzelius studied
				2,000 compounds to investigate these proportions. He invented the naming system we
				use today &ndash; H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and so on &ndash; and compiled a list of atomic
				weights for all 40 elements that were then known. He also coined the term “organic
				chemistry” for the chemistry of living organisms &ndash; the term later came to mean most
				chemistry involving carbon. In 1809, French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac
				explained how gases combine in simple proportions by volume, and two years later the
				Italian Amedeo Avogadro suggested that equal volumes of gas contain equal numbers of
				molecules. It was clear that there were strict rules governing the combination of
				the elements. Atoms and molecules remained essentially theoretical concepts that
				nobody had seen directly, but they were concepts with growing explanatory
				power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-547"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000179.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-548" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Valency</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In 1852, the first step towards an understanding of how atoms combine with one
					another was taken by English chemist Edward Frankland, who introduced the idea
					of valency &ndash; which is the number of atoms each atom of an element can combine
					with. Hydrogen has a valency of one; oxygen has a valency of two. Then, in 1858,
					British chemist Archibald Couper suggested that bonds were formed between
					self-linking carbon atoms, and that molecules were chains of atoms bonded
					together. So water, which was known to consist of two parts of hydrogen to one
					of oxygen, could be represented as H2O, or H&ndash;O&ndash;H, where
					“&ndash;” signifies a bond. Carbon has a valency of four, making it tetravalent, so a
					carbon atom can form four bonds, as in methane (CH4),
					where the hydrogen atoms are arranged in a tetrahedron around the carbon.
					(Today, chemists think of a bond as representing a pair of electrons shared
					between the two atoms, and the symbols H, O, and C as representing the central
					part of the appropriate atom.)</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Couper was working at the time at a laboratory in Paris. Meanwhile, in
					Heidelberg, Germany, August Kekulé had come up with the same idea, announcing in
					1857 that carbon has a valency of four, and early in 1858 that carbon atoms can
					bond to one another. Publication of Couper’s paper had been delayed, allowing
					Kekulé to publish a month before him and claim priority for the idea of
					self-bonding carbon atoms. Kekulé called the bonds between atoms “affinities”,
					and explained his ideas in greater detail in his popular <i class="calibre11">Textbook of Organic Chemistry</i>, which first appeared in
					1859.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"I spent a part of the night putting at least sketches of those musings down on

					Kekulé declared that tetravalent carbon atoms could link together to form what
					he called a “carbon skeleton”, to which other atoms with other valencies (such
					as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine) could bond. Suddenly, organic chemistry began
					to make sense, and chemists assigned structural formulae to all sorts of
					molecules.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple hydrocarbons such as methane (CH4), ethane
						(C2H6), and propane
						(C3H8) were now seen to be
					chains of carbon atoms where the spare valencies were occupied by hydrogen
					atoms. Reacting such a compound with, say, chlorine (Cl2)
					produced compounds in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms were replaced by
					chlorine atoms, making compounds such as chloromethane or chloroethane. One
					feature of this substitution was that chloropropane came in two distinct forms,
					either 1-chloropropane or 2-chloropropane, depending on whether the chlorine was
					attached to the middle carbon atom or one of the end carbon atoms (see the
					diagram above). Some compounds need double bonds to satisfy the valencies of the
					atoms: the oxygen molecule (O2), for example, and the
					molecule of ethylene (C2H4).
					Ethylene reacts with chlorine, and the result is not substitution but addition.
					The chlorine adds across the double bond, to make 1,2 dichloroethane
						(C2H4Cl2).
					Some compounds even have triple bonds, including the nitrogen molecule
						(N2) and acetylene
						(C2H2), which is highly
					reactive, and used in oxyacetylene welding torches.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Benzene, however, remained a puzzle. It turned out to have the formula
						C6H6, but is much less
					reactive than acetylene, even though both compounds have equal numbers of carbon
					and hydrogen atoms. Devising a linear structure that was not highly reactive was
					a real conundrum. There clearly had to be double bonds, but how they were
					arranged was a mystery.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;What was more, benzene reacts with chlorine not by addition (like ethylene)
					but by substitution: a chlorine atom replaces a hydrogen atom. When one of
					benzene’s hydrogen atoms is substituted by a chlorine atom, the result is only a
					single compound C6H5Cl,
					chlorobenzene. This seemed to show that all the carbon atoms were equivalent,
					since the chlorine atom might be attached to any one of them.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-550"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000013.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Kekulé</span> used the concept of valency to

					dream. The answer was a ring of carbon atoms, a ring in which all six atoms were
					equal, with a hydrogen atom bonded to each one. This meant that the chlorine in
					chlorobenzene could be attached anywhere round the ring.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Further support for this theory came from substituting hydrogen twice, to make
					dichlorobenzene
						(C6H4Cl2).
					If benzene is a six-membered ring with all the carbon atoms equal, there should
					be three distinct forms, or “isomers”, of this compound &ndash; the two chlorine atoms
					could be on adjacent carbon atoms, on carbon atoms separated by one other
					carbon, or at opposite ends of the ring. This turned out to be the case, and the
					three isomers were named ortho-, meta-, and para-dichlorobenzene
					respectively.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-553"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000105.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This image</span> of a hexabenzocoronene

					ring. To satisfy its tetravalency, each carbon atom should have four bonds to
					other atoms. This meant that they all had a “spare” bond. At first, Kekulé drew
					alternating single and double bonds around the ring, but when it became apparent
					that the ring had to be symmetrical, he suggested that the molecule oscillated
					between the two structures.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The electron was not discovered until 1896. The idea that bonds form through
					the sharing of electrons was first proposed by American chemist G N Wilson in
					1916. In the 1930s, Linus Pauling then used <a href="#calibre_link-102" class="calibre3">quantum mechanics</a> to explain that the six spare electrons in the
					benzene ring are not localized in double bonds, but are delocalized around the
					ring, and shared equally between the carbon atoms, so that the carbon-carbon
					bonds are neither single nor double, but 1.5. It would
					take these new ideas from physics to finally solve the puzzle of the structure
					of the benzene molecule.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-554" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dream of inspiration</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Kekulé’s report of his dream is the most cited personal account of a flash of
					inspiration in the whole of science. It seems that he was in a hypnagogic state
					&ndash; on the edge of going to sleep: that state where realities and imagination
					slide into one another. He described it as <i class="calibre11">Halbschlaf,</i> or half-sleep. In fact he describes two such
					reveries: the first, probably in 1855, on top of a bus in south London, heading
					for Clapham Road. “Atoms fluttered before my eyes. I had always seen these tiny
					particles in motion, but I had never succeeded in fathoming the manner of their
					motion. Today I saw how frequently two smaller ones merged into a pair; how
					larger ones engulfed two smaller ones, still larger ones bonded three and even
					four of the small ones.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The second occasion was in his study in Ghent in Belgium, possibly inspired by
					the ancient ouroboros symbol of a snake biting its own tail: “The same thing
					happened with the benzene ring theory… I turned the chair to face the fireplace
					and slipped into a languorous state…atoms fluttered before my eyes.…Long rows,
					frequently linked more densely; everything in motion, winding and turning like
					snakes. And lo, what was that? One of the snakes grabbed its own tail and the
					image whirled mockingly before my eyes.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-555"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000132.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Kekulé</span> described the moment that he

				agriculture, to the knowledge that some diseases, such as haemophilia, could be
				passed on to children. But no-one knew how it happened.</p><p class="calibre15">Greek philosophers thought that there was some sort of essence or material
				“principle” that was passed from parents to offspring. Parents conveyed the
				principle to the next generation during sexual intercourse; it was supposed to have
				originated in the blood, and paternal and maternal principles blended to make a new
				person. This idea persisted for centuries &ndash; mainly because no-one came up with
				anything better &ndash; but when it reached Charles Darwin, its fundamental weakness
				became all too clear. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection proposed
				that species changed over many generations &ndash; and in so doing gave rise to biological
				diversity. But if inheritance relied on the blending of chemical principles, surely
				the biological diversity would be diluted out of existence? It would be like mixing
				paints of different colours, and ending up with grey. The adaptations and novelties
				upon which Darwin’s theory rested would not persist.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-560"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000042.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-561" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Mendel’s discovery</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The breakthrough in understanding inheritance came nearly a century before the
					chemical structure of DNA was established &ndash; and less than a decade after Darwin
					published <i class="calibre11">On the Origin of Species</i>. Gregor
					Mendel, an Augustinian monk in Brno, was a teacher, scientist, and mathematician
					who succeeded where many better-known naturalists had failed. It was, perhaps,
					Mendel’s skills in mathematics and probability theory that proved the
					difference.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendel carried out experiments with the common pea, <i class="calibre11">Pisum sativum</i>. This plant varies in several identifiable ways,
					such as height, flower colour, seed colour, and seed shape. Mendel started
					looking at the inheritance of one characteristic at a time and applied his
					mathematical mind to the results. By breeding pea plants, which were easily
					cultivated in the monastery grounds, he could carry out a series of experiments
					to obtain meaningful data.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendel took critical precautions in his work. Recognizing that characteristics
					can skip and hide through generations, he was careful to start with pea plants
					of “pure” stock &ndash; such as white-flowered plants that only produced
					white-flowered offspring. He crossed pure white-flowered plants with pure
					purple-flowered ones, pure tall with pure short, and so on. In each case, he
					also precisely controlled the fertilization: using tweezers, he transferred
					pollen from unopened flower buds to stop them from scattering indiscriminately.
					He performed these breeding experiments many times and documented the numbers
					and characteristics of plants in the next generation, and the generation after
					that. He found that alternate varieties (such as purple flower and white flower)
					were inherited in fixed proportions. In the first generation, only one variety,
					such as purple flower, came through; in the second generation, this variety
					accounted for three-quarters of the offspring. Mendel called this the dominant
					variety. He called the other variety the recessive variety. In this case, white
					flower was recessive, and made up a quarter of the second generation plants. For
					each characteristic &ndash; tall/short; seed colour; flower colour; and seed shape &ndash;
					it was possible to identify dominant and recessive varieties according to these
					proportions.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-562"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000008.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Inherited characteristics</span> had been observed

					simultaneously &ndash; such as flower colour and seed colour. He found that offspring
					ended up with different combinations of traits and &ndash; once again &ndash; these
					combinations occurred in fixed proportions. In the first generation, all plants
					had both dominant traits (purple flower, yellow seed), but in the second
					generation there was a mixture of combinations. For instance, one-sixteenth of
					the plants had the combination with both recessive traits (white flower, green
					seed). Mendel concluded that the two characteristics were inherited
					independently of one another. In other words, inheritance of flower colour had
					no effect on inheritance of seed colour and vice versa. The fact that heredity
					was precisely proportional in this way led Mendel to conclude that it was not
					due to the blending of vague chemical principles after all, but happened because
					of discrete “particles”. There were particles controlling flower colour,
					particles for seed colour, and so on. These particles were transferred from
					parents to offspring intact. This explained why recessive traits could hide
					their effects and skip a generation: a recessive trait would only show through
					if a plant inherited two identical doses of the particle concerned. Today we

					in 1866, but his work failed to make an impact in the wider scientific world.
					The esoteric nature of his title &ndash; <i class="calibre11">Experiments in Plant
						Hybridization</i> &ndash; might have restricted the readership but, in any
					case, it took more than 30 years for Mendel to be properly appreciated for what
					he had done. In 1900, Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries published the results of
					plant breeding experiments similar to those of Mendel &ndash; including a
					corroboration of the three-to-one ratio. De Vries followed up with an
					acknowledgment that Mendel had got there first.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later, German botanist Carl Correns explicitly described Mendel’s
					mechanism for inheritance. Meanwhile, in England &ndash; spurred on after reading the
					papers of de Vries and Correns &ndash; Cambridge biologist William Bateson read
					Mendel’s original paper for the first time and immediately recognized its
					significance. Bateson would become a champion of Mendelian ideas, and he ended
					up coining the term “genetics” for this new field of biology. Posthumously, the
					Augustinian monk had at last been appreciated.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, work of a different kind &ndash; in the fields of cell biology and
					biochemistry &ndash; was guiding biologists down new avenues of research. Microscopes
					were replacing plant breeding experiments as scientists searched for clues by
					looking right inside cells. Nineteenth-century biologists had a hunch that the
					key to heredity lay in the cell’s nucleus. Unaware of Mendel’s work, in 1878,
					German Walther Flemming identified the thread-like structures inside cell nuclei
					that moved around during cell division. He named them chromosomes, meaning
					“coloured body”. Within a few years of the rediscovery of Mendel’s work,
					biologists had demonstrated that Mendel’s “particles of inheritance” were real
					and were carried on chromosomes.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"Traits disappear entirely in the hybrids, but reappear unchanged in their

					of characteristics in offspring led him to conclude that the particles of
					inheritance came in pairs. There was a particle pair for flower colour, a pair
					for seed colour, and so on. Pairs were formed at fertilization because one
					particle came from each parent &ndash; and separated again when the new generation
					reproduced to form its own sex cells. If the particles coming together were
					different varieties (such as those for purple and white flower), only the
					dominant particle would be expressed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern terms, the different varieties of genes are called alleles. Mendel’s
					first law became known as the Law of Segregation because the alleles segregated
					to form sex cells. Mendel’s second law arose when he considered two
					characteristics. The Law of Independent Assortment suggests that the relevant
					genes for each trait are inherited independently.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendel’s choice of plant species was, it turns out, fortuitous. We now know
					that the characteristics of <i class="calibre11">Pisum sativum</i>
					follow the simplest pattern of inheritance. Each characteristic &ndash; such as flower
					colour &ndash; is under the control of a single type of gene that comes in different
					varieties (alleles). However, many biological characteristics &ndash; such as human
					height &ndash; are the outcome of the interactions of many different genes.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the genes Mendel studied were inherited independently. Later work
					would show that genes can sit side-by-side on the same chromosome. Each
					chromosome carries hundreds or thousands of genes on a string of DNA. Chromosome
					pairs separate to create sex cells, and the chromosome is then passed on whole.
					This means that the inheritance of traits controlled by different genes on the
					same chromosome is not independent. Each pea characteristic studied by Mendel is
					due to a gene on a separate chromosome. If they had been on the same chromosome,
					his results would have been more complex and harder to interpret.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 20th century, research would reveal the exceptions to Mendel’s laws. As
					scientists probed more deeply into the behaviour of genes and chromosomes, they
					confirmed that inheritance can happen in more complicated ways than Mendel had
					found. However, these discoveries build on, rather than contradict, Mendel’s
					findings, which laid the foundation for modern genetics.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"I suggest…the term Genetics, which sufficiently indicates that our labours

					concentrated on breeding peas. It was this work that led him to devise his laws

				formidable champion of Darwin’s ideas, earning himself the nickname “Darwin’s
				bulldog”. More significantly, the British biologist did pioneering work on a key
				tenet in the evidence for Darwin’s theories &ndash; the idea that birds and dinosaurs are
				closely related.</p><p class="calibre15">If Darwin’s theory that species gradually changed into others was true, then the
				fossil record should show how species that were very different had diverged from
				ancestors that were very similar. In 1860, a remarkable fossil was found in
				limestone in a German quarry. It dated from the Jurassic period, and was named
					<i class="calibre11">Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>. With wings and
				feathers like a bird’s, yet from the time of the dinosaurs, it seemed to be an
				example of the kind of missing link between species that Darwin’s theory
				predicted.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;One sample, however, was not nearly enough to prove the connection between birds
				and dinosaurs, and <i class="calibre11">Archaeopteryx</i> could simply
				have been one of the earliest birds, rather than a feathered dinosaur. But Huxley
				began to study closely the anatomy of both birds and dinosaurs, and for him, the
				evidence was compelling.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-572"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000101.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-573" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A transitional fossil</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Huxley made detailed comparisons between <i class="calibre11">Archaeopteryx</i> and various other dinosaurs, and found that it was

						<i class="calibre11">Archaeopteryx</i> fossil, this time with

					also have a host of similarities in bone structure.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the link between dinosaurs and birds remained disputed for

					elements, and it became clear that certain groups of elements had similar

					that react violently with water, liberating hydrogen gas. Indeed, they are so
					similar that British chemist Humphry Davy did not distinguish between them when
					he first discovered them. Similarly, the halogen elements chlorine and bromine
					are both pungent, poisonous oxidizing agents, even though chlorine is a gas and
					bromine a liquid. British chemist John Newlands noticed that when the known
					elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar elements
					occurred every eighth place. He published his findings in 1864.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the journal <i class="calibre11">Chemical News</i> Newlands

					Newlands was ridiculed by the Chemical Society, who said that he might as well
					list the elements in alphabetical order, and refused to publish his paper. The
					significance of Newlands’ achievement would not be recognized for more than 20
					years. Meanwhile, French mineralogist Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois

					he wrote his book <i class="calibre11">Principles of Chemistry</i> in
					St Petersburg, Russia. In 1863, there were 56 known elements, and new ones were
					being discovered at a rate of about one a year. Mendeleev was convinced that
					there must be a pattern to them. In an effort to solve the puzzle, he made a set
					of 56 playing cards, each labelled with the name and major properties of one
					element.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendeleev is said to have made his breakthrough as he was about to embark on a
					winter journey in 1868. Before setting out, he laid out his cards on the table
					and began to ponder the puzzle, as though playing a game of Patience. When his
					coachman came to the door for the luggage, Mendeleev waved him away, saying he
					was busy. To and fro he moved the cards until finally he managed to arrange all
					56 elements to his satisfaction, with the similar groups running vertically. The
					following year, Mendeleev read out a paper at the Russian Chemical Society
					stating that: “The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weight,
					exhibit an apparent periodicity of properties.” He explained that elements with
					similar chemical properties have atomic weights that are either of nearly the
					same value (such as potassium, iridium, and osmium) or that increase regularly
					(such as potassium, rubidium, and caesium). He further explained that the
					arrangement of the elements into groups in the order of their atomic weights
					corresponds to their valency, which is the number of bonds the atoms can form
					with other atoms.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-583"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000109.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Mendeleev’s periodic table</span> was the

					of many yet unknown elements &ndash; for example, two elements, analogous to aluminium
					and silicon, whose atomic weights would be between 65 and 75.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendeleev’s arrangement included crucial improvements over Newlands’ Octaves.
					Below boron and aluminium, Newlands had placed chromium, which made little
					sense. Mendeleev reasoned that there must exist an as-yet undiscovered element,
					and predicted that one would be found with an atomic weight of about 68. It
					would form an oxide (a compound formed by an element with oxygen) with a
					chemical formula of M2O3, where
					“M” is the symbol for the new element. This formula meant that two atoms of the
					new element would combine with three oxygen atoms to make the oxide. He
					predicted two more elements to fill other spaces: one with an atomic weight of
					about 45, forming the oxide M2O3,
					and the other with an atomic weight of 72, forming the oxide
						MO2.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics were sceptical, but Mendeleev had made very specific claims, and one
					of the most powerful ways to support a scientific theory is to make predictions
					that are proved true. In this case, the element gallium (atomic weight 70,
					forming the oxide Ga2O3) was
					discovered in 1875; scandium (wt 45,
						Sc2O3) in 1879; and germanium
					(wt 73, GeO2) in 1886. These discoveries made Mendeleev’s

					atomic weight of tellurium must be incorrect: it should lie between 123 and 126,
					because the atomic weight of iodine is 127, and iodine should clearly follow
					tellurium in the table, according to its properties. He was wrong &ndash; the relative
					atomic weight of tellurium is in fact 127.6; it is greater than that of iodine.
					A similar anomaly occurs between potassium (wt 39) and argon (wt 40), where
					argon clearly precedes potassium in the table &ndash; but Mendeleev was not aware of
					these problems in 1869, because argon was not discovered until 1894. Argon is
					one of the noble gases, which are colourless, odourless, and hardly react with
					other elements. Difficult to detect, none of the noble gases were known at that
					time, so there were no spaces for them in Mendeleev’s table. Once argon had
					turned up, however, there were several more holes to fill, and by 1898, Scottish
					chemist William Ramsay had isolated helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. In 1902,
					Mendeleev incorporated the noble gases into his table as Group 18, and this
					version of the table forms the basis of the periodic table we use today.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The anomaly of the “wrong” atomic weights was solved in 1913 by British
					physicist Henry Moseley, who used X-rays to determine the number of protons in
					the nucleus of each atom of a particular element. This came to be called the
					atomic number of the element, and it is this number that determines the
					element’s position in the periodic table. The fact that atomic weights had given
					a close approximation followed from the fact that for the lighter elements, the
					atomic weight is roughly (though not exactly) twice the atomic number.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-587"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000043.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The six noble gases</span> that occur

					element below chromium in the table.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The table was also crucial in the search for the structure of the atom. Why
					did the properties of elements repeat in these patterns? Why were the Group 18
					elements so unreactive, while the elements in the groups on either side were the

					electricity and magnetism set the stage for a century of attempts to discover
					the links and interconnections between seemingly unconnected phenomena. It also
					inspired a significant breakthrough by Michael Faraday. Today, Faraday is
					perhaps best known for his invention of the electric motor and the discovery of
					electromagnetic induction, but it was a less celebrated discovery that provided
					Maxwell’s departure point.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;For two decades, Faraday had been attempting, on and off, to find a link
					between light and electromagnetism. Then, in 1845, he devised an ingenious
					experiment that answered the question once and for all. It involved passing a
					beam of polarized light (one in which the waves oscillate in a single direction,
					easily created by bouncing a beam of light off a smooth reflecting surface)
					through a strong magnetic field, and testing the angle of polarization on the
					other side using a special eyepiece. He found that by rotating the orientation
					of the magnetic field, he was able to affect the angle of polarization of the
					light. Based on this discovery, Faraday argued for the first time that light
					waves were some kind of undulation in the lines of force by which he interpreted
					electromagnetic phenomena.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"The special theory of relativity owes its origins to Maxwell’s equations

					Maxwell to put this intuitive idea onto a sound theoretical footing. Maxwell
					came to the problem from the opposite direction, discovering the link between
					electricity, magnetism, and light almost by accident.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxwell’s main concern was to explain just how the electromagnetic forces
					involved in phenomena such as Faraday’s induction &ndash; where a moving magnet
					induces an electric current &ndash; were operating. Faraday had invented the ingenious
					idea of “lines of force”, spreading in concentric rings around moving electric
					currents, or emerging and re-entering the poles of magnets. When electrical
					conductors moved in relation to these lines, currents flowed within them. The
					density of the lines of force and the speed of relative motion both influenced
					the strength of the current.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;But while lines of force were a useful aid to understanding the phenomenon,
					they did not have a physical existence &ndash; electrical and magnetic fields make
					their presence felt at every point in space that lies within their range of
					influence, not just when certain lines are cut. Scientists who attempted to
					describe the physics of electromagnetism tended to fall into one of two schools:
					those who saw electromagnetism as some form of “action at a distance” similar to
					Newton’s model of gravity, and those who believed that electromagnetism was
					propagated through space by waves. In general, the supporters of “action at a
					distance” hailed from continental Europe and followed the theories of <a href="#calibre_link-5" class="calibre3">electrical pioneer</a> André-Marie
						Ampère, while the believers in waves tended to be British. One
					clear way of distinguishing between the two basic theories was that action at a
					distance would take place instantaneously, while waves would inevitably take
					some time to propagate through space.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-596"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000377.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The pattern of iron filings</span> around a

					published in 1855 and 1856. These were an attempt to model Faraday’s lines of
					force geometrically in terms of the flow in a (hypothetical) incompressible
					fluid. He had limited success and in subsequent papers tried an alternative
					approach, modelling the field as a series of particles and rotating vortices. By
					analogy, Maxwell was able to demonstrate Ampère’s circuital law, which relates
					the electric current passing through a conducting loop to the magnetic field
					around it. Maxwell also showed that in this model, changes in the
					electromagnetic field would propagate at a finite (if high) speed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxwell derived an approximate value for the speed of propagation, at about
					310,700km/s (193,060 miles/s). This value was so suspiciously close to the speed
					of light as measured in numerous experiments that he immediately realized that
					Faraday’s intuition about the nature of light must be correct. In the final
					paper of the series, Maxwell described how magnetism could affect the
					orientation of an electromagnetic wave as seen in the Faraday effect.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"From a long view of the history of mankind…there can be little doubt that

					1864 to put it on a sound mathematical footing. In <i class="calibre11">A
						Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field</i>, he described light
					as a pair of electrical and magnetic transverse waves, oriented perpendicular to
					each other and locked in phase in such a way that changes to the electric field
					reinforce the magnetic field, and vice versa (the orientation of the electrical
					wave is the one that normally determines the wave’s overall polarization). In
					the last part of his paper, he laid out a series of 20 equations that offered a
					complete mathematical description of electromagnetic phenomena in terms of
					electrical and magnetic potentials &ndash; in other words, the amount of electrical or
					magnetic potential energy a point charge would experience at a specific point in
					the electromagnetic field.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxwell went on to show how electromagnetic waves moving at the speed of light
					arose naturally from the equations, apparently settling the debate about the
					nature of electromagnetism once and for all.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;He summed up his work on the subject in the 1873 Treatise on Electricity and
					Magnetism, but, convincing though the theory was, it remained unproven at the
					time of Maxwell’s death, since the short wavelength and high frequency of light
					waves made their properties impossible to measure. However, eight years later,
					in 1887, German physicist Heinrich Hertz provided the final piece of the puzzle
					(and made an enormous technological breakthrough) when he succeeded in producing
					a very different form of electromagnetic wave with low frequencies and long
					wavelengths, but with the same overall speed of propagation &ndash; the form of
					electromagnetism known today as radio waves.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"Maxwell’s equations have had a greater impact on human history than any

					development that finally produced Maxwell’s equations in the form we know
					today.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1884, a British electrical engineer, mathematician, and physicist named
					Oliver Heaviside &ndash; a self-trained genius who had already patented the coaxial
					cable for the efficient transmission of electrical signals &ndash; devised a way of
					transforming the potentials of Maxwell’s equations into vectors. These were
					values that described both the value and the direction of the force that was
					experienced by a charge at a given point in an electromagnetic field. By
					describing the direction of charges across the field rather than simply its
					strength at individual points, Heaviside reduced a dozen of the original
					equations to a mere four, and in doing so made them much more useful for
					practical applications. Heaviside’s contribution is largely forgotten today, but
					it is his set of four elegant equations that now bear Maxwell’s name.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;While Maxwell’s work settled many questions about the nature of electricity,
					magnetism, and light, it also served to highlight outstanding mysteries. Perhaps
					the most significant of these was the nature of the medium through which
					electromagnetic waves moved &ndash; for surely light waves, like all others, required
					such a medium? The quest to measure this so-called “luminiferous aether” was to
					dominate physics in the late 19th century, leading to the development of some
					ingenious experiments. The continued failure to detect it created a crisis in
					physics that would pave the way for the twin 20th-century revolutions of quantum
					theory and relativity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-601"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000325.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Maxwell-Heaviside equations</span>,

					waves are longitudinal waves; as the wave passes, rocks are moved backwards and
					forwards in the same direction as the waves are travelling. S waves are
					transverse waves (like the waves on the surface of water); the rocks are moved
					sideways to the direction of the wave. P waves travel faster than S waves, and

					around Earth from the earthquake location. Hardly any P waves from an earthquake
					were detected in this zone. Oldham knew that the speed at which seismic waves
					travel inside Earth depends on the density of the rocks. He concluded that
					properties of the rocks change with depth, and the resulting changes in speed
					cause refraction (the waves followed curved paths). The shadow zone is therefore
					caused by a sudden change in the properties of rocks deep within Earth.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we know that there is a much larger shadow zone for S waves, which
					extends across most of the hemisphere opposite the focus of the earthquake. This
					indicates an Earth interior that has very different properties from those of the
					mantle. In 1926, American geophysicist Harold Jeffreys used this evidence from S
					waves to suggest that Earth’s core is liquid, as S waves cannot pass through
					liquids. The P-wave shadow zone is not completely “shadowed”, as some P waves
					are detected there. In 1936, Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann interpreted these
					P waves as reflections from an inner, solid core. This is the model of Earth we

				phosphorescence, which occurs when light falls on a substance that then emits light
				of a different colour. Becquerel wanted to know whether phosphorescent minerals also
				emitted X-rays, which had been discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen a year earlier. To find
				out, he placed one of these minerals on top of a photographic plate that was wrapped
				in thick black paper and exposed both to the Sun. The experiment worked &ndash; the plate
				darkened; the mineral appeared to have emitted X-rays. Becquerel also showed that
				metals would block the “rays” that caused the plate to darken. The next day was
				cloudy so he could not repeat the experiment. He left the mineral on a photographic
				plate in a drawer, but the plate still darkened, even without the sunshine. He
				realized that the mineral must have an internal source of energy, which turned out
				to be the result of the breakdown of atoms of uranium in the mineral he was using.
				He had detected radioactivity.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"It was necessary at this point to find a new para to define this new property

					decided to investigate these new “rays”. Using an electrometer &ndash; a device for
					measuring electrical currents &ndash; she found that air around a sample of a
					uranium-containing mineral was conducting electricity. The level of electrical
					activity depended only on the amount of uranium present, not on the total mass
					of the mineral (which included elements other than uranium). This led her to the
					belief that the radioactivity came from the uranium atoms themselves, and not
					from any reactions between uranium and other elements.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Curie soon found that some minerals that contained uranium were more
					radioactive than uranium itself, and wondered whether these minerals contained
					another substance &ndash; one that was more active than uranium. By 1898, she had
					identified thorium as another radioactive element. She rushed to present her
					findings in a paper to the Académie des Sciences, but the discovery of thorium’s

					country, Poland) and radium. They attempted to prove their discoveries by
					obtaining pure samples of the two elements, but it was not until 1902 that they
					obtained 0.1g (0.003oz) of radium chloride from a tonne of pitchblende.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, the Curies published dozens of scientific papers, including
					one outlining their discovery that radium could help to destroy tumours. They
					did not patent these discoveries, but in 1903, they were jointly awarded the
					Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Becquerel. Marie continued her scientific
					work after her husband’s death in 1906, and succeeded in isolating a pure sample

					physicists Ernest Rutherford and Ernest Marsden to formulate their new model of
					the atom in 1911, but it was not until 1932 that English physicist James
					Chadwick discovered neutrons and the process of radiation could be fully
					explained. Neutrons and positively charged protons are subatomic particles that
					make up the nucleus of an atom, which also has negatively charged electrons
					whizzing around it. The protons and neutrons contribute almost all the mass of
					the atom. Atoms of a particular element always have the same number of protons
					but may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms with different numbers of
					neutrons are called isotopes of the element. For example, an atom of uranium
					always has 92 protons in its nucleus, but may have between 140 and 146 neutrons.
					These isotopes are named after the total number of protons and neutrons, so the
					most common isotope of uranium, with 146 neutrons, is written as uranium-238
					(i.e. 92 + 146).</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many heavy elements, such as uranium, have nuclei that are unstable, and this
					leads to spontaneous radioactive decay. Rutherford named the emissions from
					radioactive elements alpha, beta, and gamma rays. The nucleus becomes more
					stable by emitting an alpha particle, a beta particle, or gamma radiation. An
					alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons. Beta particles can be
					electrons or their opposites, positrons, emitted from the nucleus when a proton
					turns into a neutron or vice versa. Alpha and beta decay both change the number
					of protons in the nucleus of the decaying atom so that it becomes an atom of a
					different element. Gamma rays are a form of high-energy short-wave
					electromagnetic radiation and do not change the nature of the element.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Radioactive decay is different from the fission process that takes place
					inside nuclear reactors, and the fusion process that powers the Sun. In fission,
					unstable nuclei such as uranium-235 are bombarded with neutrons and break up to
					form much smaller atoms, releasing energy in the process. In fusion, two small
					nuclei combine to form a larger one. Fusion also releases energy, but the great
					temperatures and pressures required to start the process explain why scientists
					have only achieved fusion in the form of nuclear weapons. So far, attempts to
					use nuclear fusion to generate electricity consume more energy than is
					released.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-116"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000020.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Radioactive decay</span> can happen in three
							ways. Plutonium-240 (top left) decays to make uranium and an alpha
							particle. This is an example of alpha decay. During beta decay,
							sodium-22 decays to make neon, a beta particle (in this case a
							positron), and a neutrino. With gamma decay, a high-energy nucleus gives
							off gamma radiation but no particles.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-627" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Half-life</h2></div><p class="calibre12">As a radioactive material decays, the atoms of the radioactive element change
					to other elements, and so the number of unstable atoms reduces with time. The
					fewer unstable atoms there are, the less radioactivity will be produced. The
					reduction in activity of a radioactive isotope is measured by its half-life.
					This is the time it takes for the activity to halve, which is the same as saying
					the time for the number of unstable atoms in a sample to halve. For example, the
					isotope technetium-99m is widely used in medicine, and has a half-life of 6
					hours. This means that 6 hours after a dose is injected into a patient, the
					activity will be half of its original level; 12 hours after injection, the
					activity will be one quarter of the original level, and so on. By contrast,
					uranium-235 has a half-life of over 700 million years.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-628" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Radioactive dating</h2></div><p class="calibre12">This idea of half-life can be used to date minerals or other materials. Many
					different radioactive elements with known half-lives can be used to do this, but
					one of the best known is carbon. The most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12,
					with 6 protons and 6 neutrons in each atom. Carbon-12 makes up 99 per cent of
					the carbon found on Earth, and has a stable nucleus. A tiny proportion of the
					carbon is carbon-14, which has two extra neutrons. This unstable isotope has a
					half-life of 5,730 years. Carbon-14 is constantly being produced in the upper
					atmosphere as nitrogen atoms are bombarded with cosmic rays. This means there is
					a relatively constant ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 in the atmosphere. As
					photosynthesizing plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and our
					food consists of plants (or animals that have eaten plants), there is also a
					relatively constant proportion in plants and animals while they are alive, even
					though the carbon-14 is constantly decaying. When an organism dies, no more
					carbon-14 is taken into its body, while the carbon-14 already there continues to
					decay. By measuring the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 in the body, scientists
					can work out how long ago the organism died.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This radiometric method is used to date wood, charcoal, bone, and shells.
					There are natural variations in the ratios of the carbon isotopes, but dates can
					be cross-checked with other dating methods such as tree-rings, and the
					corrections applied to objects of similar age.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"The Curie laboratory… was a cross between a stable and a potato-cellar,

					It was only later that the importance of using materials with a short half-life

				harmful agents, or germs, that cause infections in humans, other animals, plants,
				and fungi.</p><p class="calibre15">Yet at the end of the 19th century, the term virus was only just making its way
				into science and medicine. It was suggested in 1898 by Dutch microbiologist Martinus
				Beijerinck for a new category of contagious disease-causing agents. Beijerinck had a
				special interest in plants and a skilled talent for microscopy. He experimented with
				tobacco plants that were suffering from mosaic disease, a discolouring mottled
				effect on the leaves that was costly for the tobacco industry. His results led him
				to apply the term virus &ndash; already in occasional use for substances that were toxic
				or poisonous &ndash; to the contagious agents that caused the disease.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, most of Beijerinck’s contemporaries in science and medicine were
				still grappling with understanding bacteria. Louis Pasteur and German physician
				Robert Koch had first isolated and identified them as disease-causing in the 1870s,
				and more were being discovered constantly.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;A common method of testing for bacteria at the time was to pass liquid containing
				the suspected contagions through various sets of filters. One of the best known was
				the Chamberland filter, invented in 1884 by Pasteur’s colleague Charles Chamberland.
				It used minute pores in unglazed porcelain to capture particles as small as
				bacteria.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-635"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000338.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-636" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Too small to filter</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Several researchers had suspected that there was a class of infectious agents
					even tinier than bacteria that could pass on disease. In 1892, Russian botanist
					Dmitri Ivanovsky carried out tests on tobacco mosaic disease, showing that its
					infection agent passed through the filters. He established that the agent in
					this case could not be bacteria, but did not investigate further to discover
					what the agent might be.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beijerinck repeated Ivanovsky’s experiment. He, too, established that even
					after juice pressed from the leaves was filtered, tobacco mosaic disease was
					still present. Indeed, at first he thought that the cause was the fluid itself,
					which he called <i class="calibre11">contagium vivum fluidium</i>
					(contagious living fluid). He further demonstrated that the contagion carried in
					the fluid could not be grown in laboratory nutrient gels or broths, nor in any
					host organism. It had to infect its own specific living host in order to
					multiply and spread the disease.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though viruses could not be seen by light microscopes of the time, grown
					with the usual laboratory culture methods, or detected by any of the standard
					microbiological techniques, Beijerinck worked out that they really did exist. He
					insisted that they caused disease, propelling microbiology and medical science
					into a new era. It would not be until 1939, with the aid of electron
					microscopes, that tobacco mosaic virus became the first virus to have its

				Newton, were about to be thrown away, and nothing short of a new way to view space,
				time, and matter was to replace it. By 1930, the old idea of a predictable Universe
				had been shattered.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-640"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000246.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-641" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A new physics</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Physicists were finding that the equations of classical mechanics were
					producing some nonsensical results. It was clear that something was
					fundamentally wrong. In 1900, Max Planck solved the puzzle of the spectrum of
					radiation emitted by a “black box”, which had stubbornly resisted classical
					equations, by imagining that electromagnetism travelled not in continuous waves,
					but in discrete packets, or “quanta”. Five years later, Albert Einstein, a clerk
					working at the Swiss Patent Office, produced his paper on special relativity,
					asserting that the speed of light is constant and independent of the movement of
					source or observer. After working through the implications of general
					relativity, Einstein had found by 1916 that notions of an absolute time and
					space independent of the observer had gone, to be replaced by a single
					space-time, which was warped by the presence of mass to produce gravity.
					Einstein had further demonstrated that matter and energy should be considered
					aspects of the same phenomenon, capable of being converted from one to the
					other, and his equation describing their relation &ndash; <i class="calibre11">E =
							mc<sup class="calibre23">2</sup></i> &ndash; hinted at an enormous potential energy locked inside atoms.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-642" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Wave&ndash;particle duality</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Worse was to follow for the old picture of the Universe. At Cambridge, English
					physicist J J Thomson discovered the electron, showing that it has a negative
					charge and is at least a thousand times smaller and lighter than any atom.
					Studying the properties of the electron was to produce new puzzles. Not only did
					light have particle-like properties, but particles had wave-like properties,
					too. Austrian Erwin Schrödinger drew up a series of equations that described the
					probability of finding a particle in a particular place and state. His German
					colleague Werner Heisenberg showed that there was an inherent uncertainty to the
					values of place and momentum, which was initially thought to be a problem of
					measurement, but later found to be fundamental to the structure of the Universe.
					A strange picture was emerging of a warped, relative space-time with particles
					of matter smeared across it in the form of probability waves.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-643" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Splitting the atom</h2></div><p class="calibre12">New Zealander Ernest Rutherford first showed that an atom is made mostly of
					space, with a small, dense nucleus and electrons in orbit around it. He
					explained certain forms of radioactivity as the splitting of this nucleus.
					Chemist Linus Pauling took this new picture of an atom and used the ideas of
					quantum physics to explain how atoms bonded to one another. In the process, he
					showed how the discipline of chemistry was, in reality, a subsection of physics.
					By the 1930s, physicists were working on ways to unlock the energy in the atom,
					and in the USA, J Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project, which was to
					produce the first nuclear weapons.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-644" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Universe expands</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Up to the 1920s, nebulae were thought to be clouds of gas or dust within our
					own galaxy, the Milky Way, which comprised the whole of the known Universe. Then
					American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that these nebulae were in fact
					distant galaxies. The Universe was suddenly enormously bigger than anyone had
					thought. Hubble further found that the Universe was expanding in all directions.
					Belgian priest and physicist Georges Lemaître proposed that the Universe had

					much mass (as seen from its gravity) as he could explain from the observable
					stars. Not only was matter not quite what it had been thought to be, but much of
					it was not even directly detectable. It was clear that there were still major

				presented a paper setting out his method for resolving a long-standing theoretical
				conflict. In doing so, he made one of the most important conceptual leaps in the
				history of physics. Planck’s paper marked the turning point between the classical
				mechanics of Newton and quantum mechanics. The certainty and precision of Newtonian
				mechanics was to give way to an uncertain, probabilistic description of the
				Universe.</p><p class="calibre15">Quantum theory has its roots in the study of thermal radiation, the phenomenon
				that explains why we feel heat from a fire, even when the air in between it and us
				is cold. Every object absorbs and emits electromagnetic radiation. If its
				temperature rises, the wavelength of the radiation it emits decreases while its
				frequency increases. For example, a lump of coal at room temperature emits energy
				below the frequency of visible light, in the infrared spectrum. We cannot see the
				emission, so the coal appears black. Once we set the coal alight, however, it emits
				higher-frequency radiation, glowing a dull red as the emissions break into the
				visible spectrum, then white-hot and finally a brilliant blue. Extremely hot
				objects, such as stars, radiate even shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and
				X-rays, which again we cannot see. Meanwhile, in addition to producing radiation, a
				body also reflects radiation, and it is this reflected light that gives objects
				colour even when they do not glow.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1860, German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff thought of an idealized concept he
				called a “perfect black body”. This is a theoretical surface that, when at thermal
				equilibrium (not heating up or cooling down), absorbs every frequency of
				electromagnetic radiation that falls on it, and does not itself reflect any
				radiation. The spectrum of thermal radiation coming off this body is “pure”, since
				it is not mixed with any reflections &ndash; it will only be the result of the body’s own
				temperature. Kirchhoff believed that such “black-body radiation” is fundamental in
				nature &ndash; the Sun, for example, comes close to being a black-body object whose
				emitted spectrum is almost entirely a result of its own temperature. Studying the
				distribution of a black body’s light would show that emission of radiation depended
				only on a body’s temperature, and not its physical shape or chemical composition.
				Kirchhoff’s hypothesis kick-started a new experimental programme aimed at finding a
				theoretical framework that would describe black-body radiation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-647"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000270.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-648" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Entropy and black bodies</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Planck arrived at his new quantum theory through the failure of classical
					physics to explain the experimental results of black-body radiation
					distribution. Much of Planck’s work focussed on the second law of
					thermodynamics, which he had identified as an “absolute”. This law states that
					isolated systems move over time towards a state of thermodynamic equilibrium
					(meaning that all parts of the system are at the same temperature). Planck
					attempted to explain the thermal radiation pattern of a black body by working
					out the entropy of the system. Entropy is a measure of disorder, though more
					strictly it is defined as a count of the number of ways a system can organize
					itself. The higher the entropy of a system, the more ways the system has of
					organizing and producing the same overall pattern. For instance, imagine a room
					where all the molecules of air start off bunched up in the top corner. There are
					far more ways for the molecules to organize themselves so that there is roughly
					the same number of them in each cubic centimetre of the room than there are for
					them all to remain in the top corner. Over time, they distribute themselves
					equally throughout the room as the entropy of the system rises. A cornerstone of
					the second law of thermodynamics is that entropy works in one direction only. En
					route to thermal equilibrium, the entropy of a system always increases or
					remains constant. Planck reasoned that this principle ought to be evident in any
					theoretical black-body model.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-649"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000069.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">A cavity with a small</span> hole will trap

					black-body, using so-called “cavity radiation”. A small hole in a box kept at a
					constant temperature is a good approximation of a black body, as any radiation
					entering the box gets trapped inside, and the body’s emissions are purely a
					result of its temperature.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The experimental results proved bothersome for Planck’s colleague Wilhelm
					Wien, as the low-frequency emissions recorded did not fit at all with his
					equations for radiation. Something had gone wrong. In 1899, Planck arrived at a
					revised equation &ndash; the Wien&ndash;Planck law &ndash; that attempted a better description of
					the spectrum of thermal radiation from a black body.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and

					and Sir James Jeans showed how classical physics predicts an absurd distribution
					of energy in black-body emission. The Rayleigh&ndash;Jeans Law predicted that, as the
					frequency of the radiation increased, the power it emitted would grow
					exponentially. This “ultraviolet catastrophe” was so radically at odds with
					experimental findings that the classical theory must have been seriously awry.
					If it were correct, a lethal dose of ultraviolet radiation would be emitted
					whenever a light bulb was turned on.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Planck was not too troubled by the Rayleigh&ndash;Jeans Law. He was more concerned
					about the Wien&ndash;Planck Law, which, even in its revised form, was not matching the
					data &ndash; it could accurately describe the short-wavelength (high-frequency)
					spectrum of thermal emission from objects, but not the long-wavelength
					(low-frequency emissions). This is the point at which Planck broke with his
					conservatism and resorted to Ludwig Boltzmann’s probabilistic approach to arrive
					at a new expression for his radiation law.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boltzmann had formulated a new way to look at entropy by regarding a system as
					a large collection of independent atoms and molecules. While the second law of
					thermodynamics remained valid, Boltzmann’s reading gave it a probabilistic,
					rather than an absolute, truth. Thus, we observe entropy simply because it is
					overwhelmingly more likely than the alternative. A plate breaks but does not
					remake itself, but there is no absolute law preventing a plate from putting
					itself back together &ndash; it is just exceedingly unlikely to happen.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because,

					new expression for the radiation law. Imagining thermal radiation as being
					produced by individual “oscillators”, he needed to count the ways in which a
					given energy could be distributed between them.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, he divided the total energy into a finite number of discrete
					energy chunks &ndash; a process called “quantization”. Planck was a gifted cellist and
					pianist and might have imagined these “quanta” in the same way that a fixed
					number of harmonics is available to the vibrating string of an instrument. The
					resulting equation was simple, and it fitted the experimental data. Introducing
					“quanta” of energy reduced the number of states of energy available to the
					system, and in doing this (although it wasn’t his aim), Planck solved the
					ultraviolet catastrophe. He thought of his quanta as a mathematical necessity &ndash;
					as a “trick” &ndash; rather than something that was real. But when Albert Einstein
					used the concept to explain the photoelectric effect in 1905, he insisted that
					quanta were a real property of light.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As with many of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, Planck spent the rest of
					his life struggling to come to terms with the consequences of his own work.
					While he was never in any doubt about the revolutionary impact of what he had
					done, he was &ndash; according to historian James Franck &ndash; “a revolutionary against
					his own will”. He found the consequences of his equations not to his taste since
					they often gave descriptions of physical reality that clashed with our everyday
					experience of the world. But for better or worse, after Max Planck, the world of
					physics has never been the same.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-654"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000018.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The ultraviolet catastrophe</span> was a

				required a new physics to describe its interactions &ndash; and a slew of tiny particles
				that filled this infinitesimally small domain.</p><p class="calibre15">Atomic theories have a long history. The Greek philosopher Democritus developed

					<i class="calibre11">átomos</i>, which is credited to Democritus,
				means indivisible and referred to the basic units of matter. Democritus thought that
				the materials must reflect the atoms they are made of &ndash; so atoms of iron are solid
				and strong, while those of water are smooth and slippery.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the turn of the 19th century, English natural philosopher John Dalton proposed
				a new atomic theory based on his “law of multiple proportions”, which explained how
				elements (simple, uncombined substances) always combine in simple, whole-number
				ratios. Dalton saw that this meant that a chemical reaction between two substances
				is no more than the fusing of individual small components, repeated countless times.
				This was the first modern atomic theory.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-659"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000295.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-660" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A stable science</h2></div><p class="calibre12">A self-congratulatory mood was detectable in physics at the end of the 19th
					century. Certain eminent physicists made grandstanding, declarations to the

					had all been made and the programme going forwards was one of improving the
					accuracy of known quantities “to the sixth decimal place”. However, many
					research physicists of the time knew better. It was already clear that they were
					facing an entirely new and strange set of phenomena that defied
					explanation.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1896, Henri Becquerel, following a lead from Wilhelm Röntgen’s discovery of
					mysterious “X-rays” the previous year, had found an unexplained radiation. What
					were these new radiations and where were they coming from? Becquerel correctly
					surmised that this radiation was emanating from within uranium salts. When
					Pierre and Marie Curie studied the decay of radium, they discovered a constant
					and seemingly inexhaustible source of energy inside radioactive elements. If
					this were the case, it would break several fundamental laws of physics. Whatever
					these radiations were, it was clear that there were large gaps in current
					models.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-661"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000011.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">J J Thomson</span> is pictured here at work in

					sensation when he demonstrated that he could break lumps out of atoms. While
					investigating the “rays” emanating from high-voltage cathodes (negatively
					charged electrodes), he found that this particular kind of radiation was made of
					individual “corpuscles”, since it created momentary, point-like sparkles of
					light on hitting a phosphorescent screen; it was negatively charged, since a
					beam could be deflected by an electric field; and it was exceedingly light,
					weighing less than a thousandth of the lightest atom, hydrogen. Moreover, the
					weight of the corpuscle was the same, no matter which element was used as a
					source. Thomson had discovered the electron. These results were totally
					unanticipated theoretically. If an atom contains charged particles, why
					shouldn’t the opposing particles have equal mass? Previous atomic theories held
					that atoms were solid lumps. As befit their status as the most basic constituent
					of matter, they were entire, whole, and perfect. But when viewed in the light of
					Thomson’s discovery, they clearly were divisible. Put together, these new
					radiations raised the suspicion that science had failed to understand the vital
					components of matter and energy.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-663" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The plum-pudding model</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Thomson’s discovery of the electron earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in
					1906. He was enough of a theoretician, however, to see that a radical new model
					of the atom was needed to adequately incorporate his findings. His answer,
					produced in 1904, was the “plum-pudding” model. Atoms have no overall electric
					charge and, since the mass of this new electron was small, Thomson postulated
					that a larger positively charged sphere contained most of the atom’s mass, and
					the electrons were embedded in it like plums in the dough of a Christmas
					pudding. With no evidence to suggest otherwise, it was sensible to assume that
					the point charges, like the plums in a pudding, were arbitrarily distributed
					across the atom.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-664" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Rutherford revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre12">However, the positively charged parts of the atom steadfastly refused to

					atomic pair. The quest resulted in a discovery that would produce a very
					different visualization of the internal structure of the basic unit of all
					elements.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Physical Laboratories at the University of Manchester, Ernest
					Rutherford devised and directed an experiment to test Thomson’s plum-pudding
					model. This charismatic New Zealander was a gifted experimentalist with a keen
					sense of which details to pursue. Rutherford had received the 1908 Nobel Prize
					in Physics for his “Theory of Atomic Disintegration”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory proposed that the radiations emanating from radioactive elements
					were the result of their atoms breaking apart. With the chemist Frederick Soddy,
					Rutherford had demonstrated that radioactivity involved one element

					highly energetic but uncharged <a href="#calibre_link-116" class="calibre3">“gamma”
						radiation</a>.
					Rutherford classed these different forms of radiation by their penetrating
					power, from the least-penetrating alpha particles, which are blocked by thin
					paper, to gamma rays that require a thickness of lead to be stopped. He was the
					first to use alpha particles to explore the atomic realm. He was also the first
					to outline the notion of radioactive half-life and discover that “alpha

					particles. The previous year, along with the German Hans Geiger, he had
					developed zinc sulphide “scintillation screens”, which enabled individual
					collisions of alpha particles to be counted as brief bright flashes, or
					scintillations. With the help of undergraduate student Ernest Marsden, Geiger
					would use these screens to determine whether matter was infinitely divisible or
					whether atoms contained fundamental building blocks.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;They fired a beam of alpha particles from a radium source at an extremely thin
					strip of gold leaf, just a thousand or so atoms thick. If, as the plum-pudding
					model held, gold atoms consisted of a diffuse cloud of positive charge with
					point-like negative charges, then the massive, positively charged alpha
					particles would plough straight through the foil. Most of the particles would be
					deflected only slightly by interaction with the gold atoms and would be
					scattered across shallow angles.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Geiger and Marsden spent long hours sat in the darkened laboratory, peering
					down microscopes and counting the tiny flashes of light on the scintillation
					screens. Then, acting on a hunch, Rutherford instructed them to position screens
					that would catch any high-angle deflections as well as at the expected low-angle
					scintillations. With these new screens in place, they discovered that some of
					the alpha particles were being deflected by more than 90º, and others were
					rebounding off the foil back the way they came. Rutherford described the result
					as like firing a 15-inch shell at tissue paper and having it bounce back.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my

					angles was possible only if the positive charge and mass of an atom were
					concentrated in small volume. In light of these results, in 1911, Rutherford
					published his conception of the structure of the atom. The “Rutherford Model” is
					a solar system in miniature, with electrons orbiting a small, dense, positively
					charged nucleus. The model’s major innovation was the infinitesimally small
					nucleus, which forced the uncomfortable conclusion that the atom is not at all
					solid. Matter at an atomic scale is mostly space, governed by energy and force.
					This was a definitive break from the atomic theories of the previous
					century.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;While Thomson’s “plum-pudding” atom had been an instant hit, Rutherford’s
					model was largely ignored by the scientific community. Its failings were all too
					plain to see. It was well established that accelerating electric charges emit
					energy as electromagnetic radiation. Thus, as electrons swoop around the nucleus
					&ndash; experiencing circular acceleration that keeps them in their orbits &ndash; they
					ought to be continually emitting electromagnetic radiation. Steadily losing
					energy as they orbited, the electrons would spiral inexorably into the nucleus.
					According to Rutherford’s model, atoms ought to be unstable, but clearly they
					are not.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-669" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A quantum atom</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Danish physicist Niels Bohr saved the Rutherford model of the atom from
					languishing in obscurity by applying new ideas about quantization to matter. The
					quantum revolution had begun in 1900 when Max Planck had proposed the
					quantization of radiation, but the field was still in its infancy in 1913 &ndash; it
					would have to wait until the 1920s for a formalized mathematical framework of
					quantum mechanics. At the time Bohr was working on this problem, quantum theory
					essentially consisted of no more than Einstein’s notion that light comes in tiny
					“quanta” (discrete packets of energy) that we now call photons. Bohr sought to
					explain the precise pattern of absorption and emission of light from atoms. He
					suggested that each electron is confined to fixed orbits within atomic “shells”,
					and that the energy levels of the orbits are “quantized” &ndash; that is, they can
					only take certain specific values.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In this orbital model, the energy of any individual electron is closely
					related to its proximity to the atom’s nucleus. The closer an electron is to the
					nucleus, the less energy it has, but it can be excited into higher energy levels
					by absorbing electromagnetic radiation of a certain wavelength. On absorbing
					light, an electron leaps to a “higher”, or outer, orbit. On attaining this
					higher state, the electron will promptly drop back into the lower-energy orbit,
					releasing a quantum of energy that precisely matches the energy gap between the
					two orbitals.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohr offered no explanation for what this meant or what it might look like &ndash;
					he simply stated that falling out of orbit into the nucleus was, for electrons,
					impossible. Bohr’s was a purely theoretical model of the atom. However, it
					agreed with experiment and solved many associated problems in an elegant stroke.
					The way in which electrons would have to fill up empty shells in a strict order,
					getting progressively farther from the nucleus, matched the march of the
					properties of the elements seen across the periodic table as atomic number
					increases. Even more convincing was the way in which the theoretical energy
					levels of the shells neatly fitted actual “spectral series” &ndash; the frequencies of
					light absorbed and emitted by different atoms. A long-sought-after way to marry

					ask what lay inside the nucleus. In experiments reported in 1919, Rutherford
					found that his beams of alpha particles could generate hydrogen nuclei from many
					different elements. Hydrogen had long been recognized as the simplest of all the
					elements and thought of as a building block for all other elements, so
					Rutherford proposed that the hydrogen nucleus was in fact its own fundamental
					particle, the proton.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The next development in atomic structure was James Chadwick’s 1932 discovery
					of the neutron, in which Rutherford once again had a hand. Rutherford had
					postulated the existence of the neutron in 1920 as a way to compensate for the
					repulsive effect of many point-sized positive charges crammed into a tiny
					nucleus. Like charges repel each other, so he theorized that there must be
					another particle that somehow dissipates the charge or binds the jostling
					protons tightly together. There was also extra mass in elements heavier than
					hydrogen, which could be accounted for by a third, neutral but equally massive
					subatomic particle.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the neutron proved difficult to detect and it took nearly a decade of
					searching to find it. Chadwick was working at the Cavendish Laboratory under the
					supervision of Rutherford. Guided by his mentor, he was studying a new kind of
					radiation that had been found by the German physicists Walther Bothe and Herbert
					Becker when they bombarded beryllium with alpha particles.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Chadwick duplicated the Germans’ results and realized that this penetrating
					radiation was the neutron Rutherford had been looking for. A neutral particle,
					such as the neutron, is much more penetrating than a charged particle, such as a
					proton, because it feels no repulsion as it passes through matter. However, with
					mass slightly greater than a proton, it can easily knock protons out of the
					nucleus, something that otherwise only extremely energetic electromagnetic
					radiation can do.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"The difficulties disappear if it be assumed that the radiation consists of

					photoelectric effect. This phenomenon had been discovered by German physicist
					Heinrich Hertz in 1887. It involves metal electrodes producing a flow of
					electricity (that is, emitting electrons) when illuminated by certain
					wavelengths of radiation &ndash; typically ultraviolet light. The principle behind the
					emission is fairly easily described in modern terms (energy supplied by the
					radiation is absorbed by the outermost electrons in the metal’s surface atoms,
					allowing them to break free). The puzzle was that the same materials stubbornly
					refused to emit electrons when illuminated by longer wavelengths, no matter how
					intense the light source.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a problem for the classical understanding of light, which assumed
					that intensity, above all, governed the amount of energy being delivered by a
					light beam. Einstein’s paper, however, seized on the idea of “quantized light”
					recently developed by Max Planck. Einstein showed that if the beam of light is
					split into individual “light quanta” (what we would today call photons), then
					the energy carried by each quantum depends only on its wavelength &ndash; the shorter
					the wavelength, the higher the energy. If the photoelectric effect relies on
					interaction between an electron and a single photon, then it does not matter how
					many photons bombard the surface (that is, how intense the light source is) &ndash; if
					none of them carries sufficient energy, the electrons will not break
					free.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein’s idea was rejected by leading figures of the day, including Planck,
					but his theory was shown to be correct by experiments conducted by American
					physicist Robert Millikan in 1919.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical

					also involved an important reconceptualization of the true nature of light.
					Since the late 19th century, physicists had faced a crisis in their attempts to
					understand the speed of light. Its approximate value had been known and
					calculated with increasing accuracy since the 17th century, while James Clerk
					Maxwell’s equations had demonstrated that visible light was just one
					manifestation of a wider spectrum of electromagnetic waves, all of which must
					move through the Universe at a single speed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since light was understood to be a transverse wave, it was assumed that it
					propagated through a medium, just as water waves travel on the surface of a
					pond. The properties of this hypothetical substance, known as the “luminiferous
					aether”, would give rise to the observed properties of electromagnetic waves,
					and since they could not alter from place to place, they would provide an
					absolute standard of rest.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;One expected consequence of the fixed aether was that the speed of light from
					distant objects should vary depending on the relative motion of source and
					observer. For example, the speed of light from a distant star should vary
					significantly depending on whether it was observed from one side of Earth’s
					orbit, as our planet moved away from it at 30km/s (20 miles/s), or on the
					opposite side, when the observer was moving towards it at a similar
					speed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring Earth’s motion through the aether became an obsession for late
					19th-century physicists. Such a measurement was the only way of confirming the
					existence of this mysterious substance, and yet the proof remained elusive.
					However precise the measuring equipment, light always seemed to move at the same
					speed. In 1887, US physicists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley devised an
					ingenious experiment to measure the so-called “aether wind” with high precision,
					but once again found no evidence for its existence. The negative result of the
					Michelson-Morley experiment shook the belief in the aether’s existence, and
					similar results from attempts to repeat it over the following decades only
					intensified the sense of crisis.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein’s third 1905 paper, <i class="calibre11">On the Electrodynamics of
						Moving Bodies</i>, confronted the problem head on. Special
					relativity, as his theory became known, was developed from an acceptance of two
					simple postulates &ndash; that light moves through a vacuum with a fixed speed that is
					independent of the motion of the source, and that the laws of physics should
					appear the same to observers in all “inertial” frames of reference &ndash; that is,
					those not subject to external forces such as acceleration. Einstein was
					undoubtedly helped in accepting the first bold postulate by his previous
					acceptance of the quantum nature of light &ndash; conceptually, light quanta are often
					imagined as tiny self-contained packets of electromagnetic energy, able to
					travel through the vacuum of space with particle-like properties while still
					maintaining their wave-like characteristics.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting these two postulates, Einstein considered the consequences for the
					rest of physics, and mechanics in particular. In order for the laws of physics
					to behave in the same way in all inertial reference frames, they would
					necessarily appear to be different when looking from one frame to another. Only
					relative motion mattered, and when the relative motion between two separate
					frames of reference approached the speed of light (so-called “relativistic”
					speeds) strange things began to happen.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"Mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same

					publications, it did mention the work of a handful of other contemporary
					scientists, for Einstein was certainly not the only person working towards an
					unorthodox solution to the aether crisis. Perhaps the most significant of these
					was Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, whose “Lorentz factor” lay at the heart of
					Einstein’s description of physics close to the speed of light. It is defined
					mathematically as: <span class="centeraligned"><img alt="" src="images/000147.gif" class="calibre24" /></span> Lorentz developed this equation to describe the changes in
					time and length measurements required in order to reconcile the Maxwell
					equations of electromagnetism with the principle of relativity. It was crucial
					to Einstein as it provided a term for transforming results as seen by one
					observer to show what they look like to another observer who is in motion
					relative to the first observer. In the term quoted above, <i class="calibre11">v</i> is the speed of one observer compared to the
					other, and <i class="calibre11">c</i> is the speed of light. In most
					situations, <i class="calibre11">v</i> will be very small compared to
						<i class="calibre11">c</i>, so <i class="calibre11">v</i><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>/<i class="calibre11">c</i><sup class="calibre23">2</sup> will be close to zero, and the Lorentz factor close
					to 1, meaning that it makes almost no difference to calculations.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorentz’s work had been coolly received, largely because it could not be
					incorporated into standard aether theories. Einstein approached the problem from
					the other direction, showing that the Lorentz factor arose as an inevitable
					consequence of the principle of special relativity and re-examining the true
					meaning of measured time and distance intervals. An important result of this was
					the realization that events that appeared simultaneous for an observer in one
					reference frame were not necessarily so for someone in a different reference
					frame (a phenomenon known as the relativity of simultaneity). Einstein also
					showed how from the point of view of a distant observer, the length of moving
					objects in their direction of travel became compressed as they approached the
					speed of light, in accordance with a simple equation governed by the Lorentz
					factor. Even more strangely, time itself appears to run more slowly as measured
					from the observer’s reference frame.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-682"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000022.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In Einstein’s thought experiment</span>, for a

					them, M. An observer on the train is at a position M<sup class="calibre23">1</sup>
					in a separate frame of reference. When the flashes occur,
						M<sup class="calibre23">1</sup> may be passing right by M. However, by the
					time the light has reached the observer on the train, the train has moved
					towards point B and away from point A. As Einstein puts it, the observer is
					“riding ahead of the beam of light coming from A”. The observer on the train
					concludes that lightning strike B occurred before strike A. Einstein now insists
					that: “Unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time
					refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.” Both time

						mirabilis</i> seemed too obscure at first to make much impression
					beyond the rarefied world of physics, it propelled him to fame within that
					community. Over the next few years, many scientists reached the conclusion that
					special relativity offered a better description of the Universe than the
					discredited aether theory, and devised experiments that demonstrated
					relativistic effects in action. Meanwhile, Einstein was already moving on to a
					new challenge, extending the principles that he had now established in order to
					consider “non-inertial” situations &ndash; those involving acceleration and
					deceleration.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1907, Einstein had hit upon the idea that a situation of “free
					fall” under the influence of gravity is equal to an inertial situation &ndash; the
					equivalence principle. In 1911, he realized that a stationary frame of reference
					influenced by a gravitational field is equivalent to one undergoing constant
					acceleration. Einstein illustrated this idea by imagining a person standing in a
					sealed lift in empty space. The lift is being accelerated in one direction by a
					rocket. The person feels a force pushing up from the floor, and pushes back
					against the floor with equal and opposite force following Newton’s Third Law.
					Einstein realized that the person in the lift would feel exactly as they would
					if they were standing still in a gravitational field.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lift undergoing constant acceleration, a beam of light fired at an angle
					perpendicular to the acceleration would be deflected onto a curved path, and
					Einstein reasoned that the same would occur in a gravitational field. It was
					this effect of gravity on light &ndash; known as gravitational lensing &ndash; that would
					first demonstrate general relativity.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein considered what this said about the nature of gravity. In particular,
					he predicted that relativistic effects such as time dilation should occur in
					strong gravitational fields. The closer a clock is to a source of gravitation,
					the more slowly it will tick. This effect remained purely theoretical for many
					years, but has now been confirmed using atomic clocks.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-686"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000308.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-687"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000176.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">According to general relativity</span>, mass

							lensing.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-688" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Space-time manifold</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Meanwhile, also in 1907, Einstein’s former tutor Hermann Minkowski had hit
					upon another important part of the puzzle. Considering the effective trade-offs
					between the dimensions of space and time involved in special relativity, he
					developed the idea of combining the three dimensions of space with one of time
					in a space-time manifold. In Minkowski’s interpretation, relativistic effects
					could be described in geometrical terms by considering distortions in the way
					that observers in relative motion observe the manifold in a different frame of
					reference.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1915, Einstein published his complete theory of general relativity. In its
					finished form, it was nothing less than a new description of the nature of
					space, time, matter, and gravity. Adopting Minkowski’s ideas, Einstein saw the
					“stuff of the Universe” as a space-time manifold that could be distorted thanks
					to relativistic motion, but could also be warped by the presence of large masses
					such as stars and planets in a way that was experienced as gravity. The
					equations that described the link between mass, distortion, and gravity were
					fiendishly complex, but Einstein used an approximation to solve a long-standing
					mystery &ndash; the way in which Mercury’s closest approach to the Sun (aphelion)
					precesses, or rotates, around the Sun much more quickly than predicted by
					Newtonian physics. General relativity solved the puzzle.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-689"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000055.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Arthur Eddington’s photographs</span> of a

					objector to the war, and, as it happened, Secretary of the Royal Astronomical
					Society.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddington became aware of Einstein’s work thanks to letters from Dutch
					physicist Willem de Sitter, and soon became its chief advocate in Britain. In
					1919, a few months after the end of the war, Eddington led an expedition to the
					island of Príncipe, off the west coast of Africa, in order to test the theory of
					general relativity and its prediction of gravitational lensing in the most
					spectacular circumstances. Einstein had predicted as early as 1911 that a total
					solar eclipse would allow the effects of gravitational lensing to be seen, in
					the form of apparently out-of-place stars around the eclipsed disc (a result of
					their light being deflected as it passed through the warped space-time around

				Earth’s continents were once joined but moved apart over millions of years.
				Scientists only accepted his theory once they had worked out what made such vast
				landmasses move.</p><p class="calibre15">Looking at the first maps of the New World and Africa, Francis Bacon had noted, in
				1620, that the eastern coasts of the Americas are roughly parallel with the western
				coasts of Europe and Africa. This led scientists to speculate that these landmasses
				were once joined, challenging conventional notions of a solid, unchanging
				planet.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1858, Paris-based geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini showed that similar
				plant fossils had been found on either side of the Atlantic, dating back to the
				Carboniferous period, 359&ndash;299 million years ago. He made maps showing how the
				American and African continents may once have fitted together, and attributed their
				separation to the biblical Flood. When fossils of <i class="calibre11">Glossopteris</i> ferns were found in South America, India, and Africa,
				Austrian geologist Eduard Suess argued that they must have evolved on a single
				landmass. He suggested that the southern continents were once linked by land bridges
				across the sea, forming a supercontinent that he called Gondwanaland.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wegener found more examples of similar organisms separated by oceans, but also
				similar mountain ranges and glacial deposits. Instead of earlier ideas that portions
				of a supercontinent had sunk beneath the waves, he thought perhaps it had split
				apart. Between 1912 and 1929, he expanded on this theory. His supercontinent &ndash;
				Pangaea &ndash; joined Suess’s Gondwanaland to the northern continents of North America
				and Eurasia. Wegener dated the fragmentation of this single landmass to the end of
				the Mesozoic era, 150 million years ago, and pointed to Africa’s Great Rift Valley
				as evidence of ongoing continental breakup.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-695"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000086.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-696" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Search for a mechanism</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Wegener’s theory was criticized by geophysicists for not explaining how

					mapping of the sea bed revealed signs of more recent ocean-floor formation. This
					was found to occur at mid-ocean ridges, as molten rock erupts through cracks in
					Earth’s crust and spreads away from the ridges as new rock erupts.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, Harry Hess realized that seafloor spreading provided the mechanism
					for continental drift, and presented his theory of plate tectonics. Earth’s
					crust is made up of giant plates that continually shift as convection currents
					in the mantle below bring new rock to the surface, and it is the formation and

					dominant trait and white was recessive. When those offspring were cross-bred,
					one in four of the next generation was white-eyed, and always male. The “white
					gene” must be linked to sex. When other traits linked to sex appeared, Morgan
					concluded that all these traits must be inherited jointly and the genes
					responsible for them must all be carried on the chromosome that determines sex.
					The females had a pair of X chromosomes, while males had an X and a Y. During

				formed the basis of today’s quantum mechanics and revolutionized the way we perceive
				the world. But this revolution did not happen suddenly. The process of discovery was
				a long one, with many pioneers along the way.</p><p class="calibre15">Quantum theory was originally limited to the understanding of light. In 1900, as

				the emission spectra (distribution of light wavelengths) of atoms in terms of

					of particles, even though light had also been proved, through Thomas Young’s
					double-slit experiment, to behave as a wave. The puzzle of how light could
					possibly be both particle and wave received a new twist in 1924 from a French
					PhD student, Louis de Broglie, whose suggestion led the quantum revolution into
					a dramatic new phase. Not only did de Broglie demonstrate with a simple equation
					how, in the subatomic world, particles could equally be waves, he also showed
					how any object, of whatever mass, could behave as a wave to some extent. In
					other words, if light waves had particle-like properties, then particles of
					matter &ndash; such as electrons &ndash; must have wave-like properties.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Planck had calculated the energy of a light photon with the simple equation
						<i class="calibre11">E</i> = <i class="calibre11">hv,</i> where <i class="calibre11">E</i> is the energy of
					the electromagnetic quanta, <i class="calibre11">v</i> is the
					wavelength of the radiation involved, and <i class="calibre11">h</i>
					is a constant, today known as the Planck constant. De Broglie showed that a
					light photon also has momentum, something normally only associated with
					particles with mass and given by multiplying the particle’s mass with its speed.
					De Broglie showed that a light photon had a momentum of <i class="calibre11">h</i> divided by its wavelength. However, since he was dealing with
					particles whose energy and mass might be affected by motion at speeds close to
					that of light, de Broglie incorporated the <a href="#calibre_link-124" class="calibre3">Lorentz factor</a>
					into his equation. This produced a more sophisticated version that took into
					account the effects of relativity.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;De Broglie’s idea was radical and daring, but it soon had influential
					supporters, including Einstein. The hypothesis was also relatively easy to test.
					By 1927, scientists in two separate laboratories had conducted experiments to
					show that electrons diffracted and interfered with each other in exactly the

					they wanted to know how the properties of such matter waves could give rise to
					the pattern of specific energy levels among the electron orbitals of the
					hydrogen atom proposed by Bohr’s model of the atom. De Broglie himself had
					suggested that the pattern arose because the circumference of each orbital must
					accommodate a whole number of wavelengths of the matter wave. Since the
					electron’s energy level depends on its distance from the atom’s positively
					charged nucleus, this meant that only certain distances, and certain energy
					levels, would be stable. However, de Broglie’s solution relied on treating the
					matter wave as a one-dimensional wave trapped in orbit around the nucleus &ndash; a
					full description would need to describe the wave in three dimensions.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-714" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The wave equation</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In 1925, three German physicists, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual
					Jordan, tried to explain the quantum jumps that occurred in Bohr’s model of the
					atom with a method called matrix mechanics, in which the properties of an atom
					were treated as a mathematical system that could change over time. However, the
					method could not explain what was actually happening inside the atom, and its
					obscure mathematical language did not make it very popular.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later, an Austrian physicist working in Zurich, Erwin Schrödinger, hit
					upon a better approach. He took de Broglie’s wave-particle duality a step
					further and began to consider whether there was a mathematical equation of wave
					motion that would describe how a subatomic particle might move. To formulate his
					wave equation, he began with the laws governing energy and momentum in ordinary
					mechanics, then amended them to include the Planck constant and de Broglie’s law
					connecting the momentum of a particle to its wavelength.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;When he applied the resulting equation to the hydrogen atom, it predicted
					exactly the specific energy levels for the atom that had been observed in
					experiments. The equation was a success. But one awkward issue remained, because
					no one, not even Schrödinger, knew exactly what the wave equation really
					described. Schrödinger tried to interpret it as the density of electric charge,
					but this was not entirely successful. It was Max Born who eventually suggested
					what it really was &ndash; it was a probability amplitude. In other words, it
					expressed the likelihood of a measurement finding the electron in that
					particular place. Unlike matrix mechanics, the Schrödinger wave equation or
					“wavefunction” was embraced by physicists, although it threw open a whole range
					of wider questions about its proper interpretation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-715"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000056.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">A classic illustration</span> of wave-particle

					another Austrian, Wolfgang Pauli. In order to describe why the electrons within
					an atom did not all automatically fall directly into the lowest possible energy
					state, Pauli developed the exclusion principle. Reasoning that a particle’s
					overall quantum state could be defined by a certain number of properties, each
					with a fixed number of possible discrete values, his principle stated that it
					was impossible for two particles within the same system to have the same quantum
					state simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to explain the pattern of electron shells that was apparent from the
					periodic table, Pauli calculated that electrons must be described by four
					distinct quantum numbers. Three of these &ndash; the principal, azimuthal, and
					magnetic quantum numbers &ndash; define the electron’s precise place within the
					available orbital shells and subshells, with the values of the latter pair
					limited by the value of the principal number. The fourth number, with two
					possible values, was needed to explain why two electrons can exist in each
					subshell with slightly different energy levels. Together, the numbers neatly
					explained the existence of atomic orbitals that accept 2, 6, 10, and 14
					electrons respectively.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the fourth quantum number is known as spin; it is a particle’s
					intrinsic angular momentum (which is created by its rotation as it orbits), and
					has positive or negative values that are either whole- or half-integer numbers.
					A few years later, Pauli would demonstrate that values of spin split all
					particles into two major groups &ndash; fermions such as electrons (with half-integer
					spins), which obey a set of rules known as <a href="#calibre_link-125" class="calibre3">Fermi&ndash;Dirac</a> statistics, and bosons such
					as photons (with zero or whole-number spin), which obey different rules known as
					Bose&ndash;Einstein statistics. Only fermions obey the exclusion principle, and this
					has important implications for the understanding of everything from collapsing
					stars to the elementary particles that make up the Universe.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-716" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Schrödinger’s success</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Combined with Pauli’s exclusion principle, Schrödinger’s wave equation allowed
					a new and deeper understanding of the orbitals, shells, and subshells within an
					atom. Rather than imagining them as classical orbits &ndash; well-defined paths on
					which the electrons circle the nucleus &ndash; the wave equation shows that they are
					actually clouds of probability &ndash; doughnut-shaped and lobe-shaped regions in
					which a particular <a href="#calibre_link-117" class="calibre3">electron</a> with
					certain quantum numbers is likely to be found.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major success for Schrödinger’s approach was that it offered an
					explanation for radioactive alpha decay &ndash; in which a fully formed alpha particle
					(consisting of two protons and two neutrons) escapes from an atomic nucleus.
					According to classical physics, in order to remain intact, the nucleus had to be
					surrounded by a potential well steep enough to prevent particles escaping from
					it. (A potential well is a region in space where the potential energy is lower
					than its surroundings, meaning that it traps particles.) If the well was not
					sufficiently steep, the nucleus would disintegrate completely. How, then, could
					the intermittent emissions seen in alpha decay happen while allowing the
					remaining nucleus to survive intact? The wave equations overcame the problem
					because they allowed the energy of the alpha particle within the nucleus to
					vary. Most of the time, its energy would be low enough to keep it trapped, but

					middle years of the 20th century (and remains essentially unresolved today)
					surrounded what the wavefunction actually meant for reality. In an echo of the
					Planck/Einstein debate two decades previously, de Broglie saw his and
					Schrödinger’s equations as mere mathematical tools for describing movement: for
					de Broglie, the electron was still essentially a particle &ndash; just one that had a
					wave property governing its motion and location. For Schrödinger, however, the
					wave equation was far more fundamental &ndash; it described the way in which the
					properties of the electron were physically “smeared out” across space.
					Opposition to <a href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre3">Schrödinger’s</a> approach
					inspired Werner Heisenberg to develop another of the century’s great ideas &ndash; the
					uncertainty principle. This was a
					realization that the wavefunction meant that a particle can never be “localized”
					to a point in space and at the same time have a defined wavelength. The more
					accurately a particle’s position was pinned down, for example, the harder its
					momentum was to measure. Thus, particles defined by a quantum wavefunction
					existed in a general state of uncertainty.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"God knows I am no friend of probability theory, I have hated it from the

					be in one location, rather than in its wave-like smear. On the scale of
					classical physics and everyday life, most situations involved definite
					measurements and definite outcomes, rather than myriad overlapping
					possibilities. The challenge of reconciling quantum uncertainty with reality is
					called the measurement problem, and various approaches to it have been put
					forward, known as interpretations.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous of these is the Copenhagen interpretation, devised by Niels
					Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This states simply that it is the very
					interaction between the quantum system and a large-scale, external observer or
					apparatus (subject to the classical laws of physics) that causes the
					wavefunction to “collapse” and a definite outcome to arise. This interpretation
					is perhaps the most widely (though not universally) accepted, and appears to be
					borne out by experiments such as electron diffraction and the double-slit
					experiment for light waves. It is possible to devise an experiment that reveals
					the wave-like aspects of light or electrons, but impossible to record the
					properties of individual particles in the same apparatus.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Copenhagen interpretation seems reasonable when dealing
					with small-scale systems such as particles, its implication that nothing is
					determined until it is measured troubled many physicists. Einstein famously
					commented that “God does not throw dice”, while Schrödinger devised a
					thought-experiment to illustrate what he viewed as a ridiculous
					situation.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Schrödinger’s cat</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Taken to its logical conclusion, the Copenhagen interpretation resulted in a
					seemingly absurd paradox. Schrödinger imagined a cat sealed in a box that
					contains a vial of poison linked to a radioactive source. If the source decays
					and emits a particle of radiation, a mechanism will release a hammer that breaks
					the vial of poison. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the radioactive
					source remains in its wavefunction form (as a so-called “superposition” of two
					possible outcomes) until it is observed. But if that is the case, the same has
					to be said of the cat.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-720" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New interpretations</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Dissatisfaction with apparent paradoxes such as Schrödinger’s cat has spurred
					scientists to develop various alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics.
					One of the best known is the “Many Worlds Interpretation” put forward in 1956 by
					American physicist Hugh Everett III. This resolved the paradox by suggesting
					that during any quantum event, the Universe splits into mutually unobservable
					alternate histories for each of the possible outcomes. In other words,
					Schrödinger’s cat would both live and die.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Consistent Histories” approach addresses the problem in a rather less
					radical way, using complex mathematics to generalize the Copenhagen
					interpretation. This avoids the issues around the collapse of the wavefunction,
					but instead allows probabilities to be assigned to various scenarios, or
					“histories”, on both a quantum and classical scale. The approach accepts that
					only one of these histories eventually conforms to reality, but does not allow
					prediction of which outcome that will be &ndash; instead it simply describes how
					quantum physics can give rise to the Universe we see without wavefunction
					collapse.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The ensemble, or statistical, approach is a minimalist mathematical
					interpretation that was favoured by Einstein. The de Broglie&ndash;Bohm theory, which
					developed from de Broglie’s initial reaction to the wave equation, is an attempt
					at a strictly causal, rather than probabilistic, explanation, and postulates the
					existence of a hidden “implicate” order to the Universe. The transactional
					approach involves waves travelling both forwards and backwards in time.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most intriguing possibility of all, however, is one that verges on
					the theological. Working in the 1930s, Hungarian-born mathematician John von
					Neumann concluded that the measurement problem implied that the entire Universe
					is subject to an all-encompassing wave equation known as the universal
					wavefunction, and that it is constantly collapsing as we measure its various
					aspects. Von Neumann’s colleague and countryman Eugene Wigner took the theory
					and expanded it to suggest that it was not simply interaction with large-scale
					systems (as in the Copenhagen interpretation) that caused the wavefunction to
					collapse &ndash; it was the presence of intelligent consciousness itself.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-721"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000087.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Schrödinger’s thought experiment</span>

				a number of physicists turned their attention to the question of understanding how
				the complex properties of an atom could arise from the interaction of “matter waves”
				associated with its constituent particles. In 1925, German scientists Werner
				Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan used “matrix mechanics” to model the
				hydrogen atom’s development over time. This approach was later supplanted by Erwin
				Schrödinger’s wavefunction.</p><p class="calibre15">Working with Danish physicist Niels Bohr, Heisenberg built on Schrödinger’s work
				to develop the “Copenhagen interpretation” of the way that quantum systems, governed
				by the laws of probability, interact with the large-scale world. One key element of
				this is the “uncertainty principle”, which limits the accuracy to which we can
				determine properties in quantum systems.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty principle arose as a mathematical consequence of matrix mechanics.
				Heisenberg realized that his mathematical method would not allow certain pairs of
				properties to be determined simultaneously with absolute precision. For example, the
				more accurately one measures a particle’s position, the less accurately one can
				determine its momentum, and vice versa. Heisenberg found that for these two
				properties in particular, the relationship could be written as: Δ<i class="calibre11">x</i>Δ<i class="calibre11">p</i> ≥ ħ/2
				where Δ<i class="calibre11">x</i> is the uncertainty of position,

					particle’s position involves the application of a force of some sort that means
					its kinetic energy and momentum are less well defined. This explanation, put
					forward at first by Heisenberg himself, led various scientists including
					Einstein to spend time devising thought-experiments that might obtain a
					simultaneous and accurate measurement of position and momentum by some form of
					“trickery”. However, the truth is far stranger &ndash; it turns out that uncertainty
					is an inherent feature of quantum systems.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A helpful way of thinking about the issue is to consider the matter waves
					associated with the particles: in this situation, the particle’s momentum
					affects its overall energy and therefore its wavelength &ndash; but the more tightly
					we pin down the particle’s position, the less information we have about its
					wavefunction, and therefore about its wavelength. Conversely, accurately
					measuring the wavelength requires us to consider a broader region of space, and
					therefore sacrifices information about the particle’s precise location. Such
					ideas might seem strangely at odds with those we experience in the large-scale
					world, but they have nevertheless been proved real by many experiments, and form
					an important foundation of modern physics. The uncertainty principle explains
					seemingly strange real-life phenomena such as quantum tunnelling, in which a
					particle can “tunnel” through a barrier even if its energy suggests that it

				Milky Way could be just one galaxy among countless others. Edwin Hubble was to solve
				the puzzle, and show that the Universe is much larger than anyone imagined.</p><p class="calibre15">Key to the debate was the nature of “spiral nebulae”. Today, a nebula is the term
				used for an interstellar cloud of dust and gas, but at the time of this debate, it
				was the name used for any amorphous cloud of light, including objects that were
				later found to be galaxies beyond the Milky Way.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;As telescopes improved dramatically during the 19th century, some of the objects
				catalogued as nebulae began to reveal distinctive spiral features. At the same time,
				the development of spectroscopy (the study of the interaction between matter and

				individual stars, blending seamlessly together.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of these nebulae was interesting too &ndash; unlike other objects that
				clustered together in the plane of the Milky Way, they were more common in the dark
				skies away from the plane. As a result, some astronomers adopted an idea from the
				German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who in 1755 suggested that nebulae were “island
				universes” &ndash; systems similar to the Milky Way but vastly more distant, and only
				visible where the distribution of material in our galaxy permits clear views into

					the most important was the establishment of an accurate means of measuring the
					distance to stars. The breakthrough came with the work of Henrietta Swan
					Leavitt, one of the team of female astronomers at Harvard University who were
					analysing the properties of starlight.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leavitt was intrigued by the behaviour of variable stars. These were stars
					whose brightness appeared to fluctuate, or pulse, because they periodically
					expanded and contracted as they neared the end of their lives. She began to
					study photographic plates of the Magellanic Clouds, two small patches of light
					visible from the southern sky that look like isolated “clumps” of the Milky Way.
					Each of the clouds, she found, contained huge numbers of variable stars, and by
					comparing them across many different plates, she not only saw that their light
					was varying in a regular cycle, she could also work out the period of the
					cycle.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By concentrating on these small, faint, isolated star clouds, Leavitt could
					safely assume that the stars within them were all at more or less the same
					distance from Earth. Though she could not know the distance itself, this was
					still enough to assume that differences in the “apparent magnitude” (observed
					brightness) of the stars were an indication of differences in their “absolute
					magnitude” (actual brightness). Publishing her first results in 1908, Leavitt
					noted in passing that some stars seemed to show a relationship between their
					variability period and their absolute magnitude, but it took another four years
					for her to work out what this relationship was. It turned out that, for a
					certain type of variable star known as a Cepheid variable, stars with greater
					luminosity have longer variability periods.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leavitt’s “period-luminosity” law would prove the key to unlocking the scale
					of the Universe &ndash; if you could work out the star’s absolute magnitude from its
					variability period, then the star’s distance from Earth could be calculated from
					its apparent magnitude. The first step in working this out was to calibrate the
					scale, which was done in 1913 by Swedish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung. He worked
					out the distances to 13 relatively nearby Cepheids using the <a href="#calibre_link-133" class="calibre3">parallax method</a>.
					Cepheids were immensely bright &ndash; thousands of times more luminous than our Sun
					(in modern terminology they are “yellow supergiants”). In theory, then, they
					were an ideal “standard candle” &ndash; stars whose brightness could be used to
					measure huge cosmic distances. But despite the best efforts of astronomers,
					Cepheids within the spiral nebulae remained stubbornly elusive.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-735"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000028.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Henrietta Leavitt received</span> little

					two rival cosmological schools, hoping to settle the issue of the scale of the
					Universe once and for all. Respected Princeton astronomer Harlow Shapley spoke
					for the “small Universe” side. He had been the first to use Leavitt’s work on
					Cepheids to measure the distance to globular clusters (dense star clusters in
					orbit around the Milky Way), and discovered that they were typically several
					thousand light years away. In 1918, he had used RR Lyrae stars (fainter stars
					that behave like Cepheids) to estimate the size of the Milky Way and show that
					the Sun was nowhere near its centre. His arguments appealed to public scepticism
					towards notions of an enormous Universe with many galaxies, but also cited
					specific evidence (later to be proved inaccurate), such as reports that over
					many years some astronomers had actually observed the spiral nebulae rotating.
					For this to be true without parts of the nebula exceeding the speed of light,
					they must be relatively small.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “island Universe” supporters were represented by Heber D Curtis of the
					University of Pittsburgh’s Allegheny Observatory. He based his arguments on
					comparisons between the rates of bright “nova” explosions in distant spirals and
					in our own Milky Way. Novae are very bright star explosions that can serve as
					distance indicators.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Curtis also cited the evidence of another, crucial factor &ndash; the high redshift
					exhibited by many spiral nebulae. This phenomenon had been discovered by Vesto
					Slipher of the Flagstaff Observatory, Arizona, in 1912 &ndash; apparent through
					distinctive shifts in the pattern of a nebula’s spectral lines towards the red
					end of the spectrum. Slipher, Curtis, and many others believed that they were
					caused by the Doppler effect (a change in the wavelength of light due to
					relative motion between source and observer), and therefore indicated that the
					nebulae were moving away from us at very high speeds &ndash; far too fast for the
					Milky Way’s gravity to keep hold of them.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-737"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000416.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">By measuring</span> the light from Cepheid

					Observatory were in a position to end the mystery once and for all. Using the
					observatory’s new 2.5m (100in) Hooker Telescope (the largest in the world at
					that time), they set out to identify Cepheid variables shining within the spiral
					nebulae, and this time they were successful in finding Cepheids in many of the
					largest and brightest nebulae.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubble then plotted their periods of variability and therefore their absolute
					magnitude. From this, a simple comparison to a star’s apparent magnitude
					revealed its distance, producing figures that were typically millions of light
					years. This proved conclusively that the spiral nebulae were really huge,
					independent star systems, far beyond the Milky Way and rivalling it in size.
					Spiral nebulae are now correctly called spiral galaxies. As if this revolution
					in the way we see the Universe were not enough, Hubble then went on to look at
					how galaxy distances related to the redshifts already discovered by Slipher &ndash;
					and here he found a remarkable relationship. By plotting the distances for more
					than 40 galaxies against their redshifts, he showed a roughly linear pattern:
					the further away a galaxy is, on average, the greater its redshift and therefore
					the faster it is receding from Earth. Hubble immediately realized that this
					could not be because our galaxy is uniquely unpopular, but must be the result of
					a general cosmic expansion &ndash; in other words, space itself is expanding and
					carrying every single galaxy with it. The wider the separation between two
					galaxies, the faster the space between them will expand. The rate of expansion
					of space soon became known as the “Hubble Constant”. It was conclusively
					measured in 2001 by the space telescope bearing Hubble’s name.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before then, Hubble’s discovery of the expanding Universe had given rise

				tiny, superdense, and extremely hot point in space, is the basis of modern
				cosmology, and one that is often said to have originated with Edwin Hubble’s 1929
				discovery of cosmic expansion. But the precursors of the theory predate Hubble’s
				breakthrough by several years, and first sprang from interpretations of Albert
				Einstein’s theory of general relativity as it applied to the Universe as a
				whole.</p><p class="calibre15">When formulating his theory, Einstein drew on the available evidence of the time
				to assume that the Universe was static &ndash; neither expanding nor contracting. General
				relativity indicated that the Universe should collapse under its own gravity, so
				Einstein fudged his own equations by adding a term known as the cosmological
				constant. Einstein’s constant mathematically counteracted the gravitational
				contraction to produce the presumed static Universe.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Famously, Einstein later called the constant his greatest mistake, but even at the
				time he proposed it there were some who found it unsatisfactory. The Dutch physicist
				Willem de Sitter and Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann independently
				suggested a solution to general relativity in which the Universe was expanding, and,
				in 1927, Belgian astronomer and priest Georges Lemaître reached the same conclusion,
				two years ahead of Hubble’s observational proof.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-743"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000118.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"The first stages of the expansion consisted of a rapid expansion determined by

					cosmic expansion to its logical conclusion, suggesting that the Universe had
					sprung from a single point that he called the “primeval atom”. The response to
					this radical idea was mixed.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The astronomical establishment of the time was attached to the idea of an
					eternal Universe without end or beginning, and the prospect of a distinct point
					of origin (especially when proposed by a Catholic priest) was seen as
					introducing an unnecessary religious element into cosmology.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Hubble’s observations were undeniable, and some kind of model was
					needed to explain the expanding Universe. Numerous theories were put forward in
					the 1930s, but by the late 1940s, just two remained in play &ndash; Lemaître’s
					primeval atom, and the rival “steady state” model, in which matter was
					continuously created as the Universe expanded. British astronomer Fred Hoyle was
					the champion of the steady state idea. In 1949, Hoyle scornfully referred to the
					rival theory as a “Big Bang”. The name stuck.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-745"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000144.png" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Since the Big Bang</span> 13.8 billion years ago,
							the expansion of the Universe has been through different phases. There was
							an initial period of rapid expansion known as inflation. After that,
							expansion slowed, then started to speed up once more.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-746" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Making the elements</h2></div><p class="calibre12">By the time Hoyle had inadvertently named the theory, a persuasive piece of
					evidence in favour of Lemaître’s hypothesis had been published, tipping the
					balance away from a steady state Universe. This was a 1948 paper written by
					Ralph Alpher and George Gamow of the Johns Hopkins University in the USA. It was
					called <i class="calibre11">The Origin of Chemical Elements</i>, and
					described in detail how subatomic particles and lightweight chemical elements
					could have been produced from the raw energy of the Big Bang, in accordance with
					Einstein’s equation <i class="calibre11">E</i>= <i class="calibre11">mc<sup class="calibre23">2</sup></i>. But this theory, later known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, explained
					a process that could form only the four lightest elements &ndash; hydrogen, helium,
					lithium, and beryllium. Only later was it discovered that the heavier elements
					of the Universe are the product of stellar nucleosynthesis (a process that takes
					place inside stars). Ironically, the evidence showing how stellar
					nucleosynthesis worked was to be developed by Fred Hoyle.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there was still no direct observational evidence to determine
					the truth of either the Big Bang or a steady state Universe. Early attempts to
					test the theories were made in the 1950s using a basic radio telescope known as
					the Cambridge Interferometer. These tests relied on a simple principle: if the
					steady state theory was true, then the Universe must be essentially uniform in
					both time and space; but if it originated 10&ndash;20 billion years ago, as the Big
					Bang theory suggested, and evolved throughout its history, then distant reaches
					of the Universe, whose radiation had taken billions of years to reach Earth,
					should appear substantially different. (This cosmic time machine effect, whereby
					we see more distant celestial objects as they were in the distant past, is known
					as “lookback time”.) By measuring the number of distant galaxies emitting
					radiation above a certain brightness, it should be possible to distinguish
					between the two scenarios.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the Cambridge experiments delivered a result that seemed to
					support the Big Bang. However, problems were discovered with the radio
					detectors, so the results had to be disregarded. Later results proved more
					equivocal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-747"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000219.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Tiny variations</span> have been found in the

					1948, Alpher and his colleague Robert Herman had predicted that the Big Bang
					would have left a residual heating effect throughout the Universe. According to
					the theory, when the Universe was about 380,000 years old, it had cooled enough
					to become transparent, allowing light photons to travel freely through space for
					the first time. The photons that existed at this time had been propagating
					through space ever since, growing longer and redder as space expanded. In 1964,
					Robert Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University set out to build a radio
					telescope that could detect this faint signal, which they thought would take the
					form of low-energy radio waves. However, they were ultimately beaten to the
					prize by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, two engineers working at the nearby
					Bell Telephone Laboratories. Penzias and Wilson had built a radio telescope for
					satellite communication, but found themselves plagued by an unwanted background
					signal that they could not eliminate. Coming from all over the sky, it
					corresponded to microwave emission from a body at a temperature of 3.5K &ndash; just
					3.5°C (6°F) above absolute zero. When Bell Labs contacted Dicke to ask for help
					with their problem, Dicke realized that they had found the remnants of the Big
					Bang &ndash; now known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR).</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery that the CMBR permeates the Universe &ndash; a phenomenon for which
					the steady state theory had no explanation &ndash; clinched the case in favour of the
					Big Bang. Subsequent measurements have shown that the CMBR’s true average
					temperature is about 2.73K, and high-precision satellite measurements have
					revealed minute variations in the signal that allow us to study conditions in
					the Universe back to 380,000 years after the Big Bang.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-749"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000071.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson</span> detected

					the Universe. Among the most significant are the introduction of dark matter and
					dark energy to the story, and the addition of a violent growth spurt in the
					instant after creation, known as Inflation. The events that triggered the Big
					Bang remain beyond our reach but measurements of the rate of cosmic expansion,
					aided by instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope, now allow us to pin
					down the epoch of cosmic creation with great accuracy &ndash; the Universe came into
					existence 13.798 billion years ago, give or take 0.037 billion years. Various
					theories exist about the future of the Universe, but many think that it is set
					to continue expanding until it reaches a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, or

				Heisenberg’s groundbreaking paper on matrix mechanics, which described how particles
				jump from one quantum state to another. Dirac was one of the few people capable of
				grasping the paper’s difficult mathematics, and noticed parallels between
				Heisenberg’s equations and parts of the classical (pre-quantum) theory of particle
				motion known as Hamiltonian mechanics. This allowed Dirac to develop a method by
				which classical systems could be understood on a quantum level.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;One early result of this work was a derivation of the idea of quantum spin. Dirac
				formulated a set of rules now known as “Fermi-Dirac statistics” (since they were
				also independently found by Enrico Fermi). Dirac named particles such as electrons
				that have a half-integer spin value “fermions”, after Fermi. The rules describe how
				large numbers of fermions interact with one another. In 1926, Dirac’s PhD supervisor
				Ralph Fowler used his statistics to calculate the behaviour of a collapsing stellar

					Maxwell while he was developing his theory of electromagnetic radiation.
					Einstein’s general relativity is another example of a field theory.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirac’s new interpretation of the quantum world was a quantum field theory. In
					1928, it allowed him to produce a relativistic version of Schrödinger’s wave
					equation for the electron (that is, one that could take into account the effects
					of particles moving close to the speed of light, and therefore model the quantum
					world more accurately than Schrödinger’s non-relativistic equation). The
					so-called “Dirac equation” also predicted the existence of particles with
					identical properties to particles of matter but with opposite electric charge.

				detectable luminous matter was first proposed by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky. In
				1922&ndash;23, Edwin Hubble had realized that “nebulae” were in fact distant galaxies. A
				decade later, Zwicky set out to measure the overall mass of the Coma cluster of
				galaxies. He used a mathematical model called the Virial theorem, which allowed him
				to calculate the overall mass from the relative velocities of individual cluster
				galaxies. To Zwicky’s surprise, his results suggested that the cluster contained
				about 400 times more mass than that suggested by the combined light of its stars.
				Zwicky called this staggering amount of unseen matter “dark matter”.</p><p class="calibre15">Zwicky’s conclusion was largely overlooked at the time, but by the 1950s, new
				technology had opened up new means of detecting non-luminous material. It was clear
				that large amounts of matter are too cool to glow in visible light but still radiate
				in infrared and radio wavelengths. As scientists began to understand the visible and
				invisible structure of our galaxy and others, the amount of “missing mass” fell
				substantially.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-768"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000230.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-769" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The invisible is real</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The reality of dark matter was finally recognized in the 1970s, after US
					astronomer Vera Rubin mapped the velocity of stars orbiting in the Milky Way and
					measured the distribution of its mass. She showed that large amounts of mass are
					distributed beyond the galaxy’s visible confines, in a region known as the
					galactic halo. Today it is widely accepted that dark matter constitutes around
					84.5 per cent of the mass in the Universe. Any hopes that it might actually be
					normal matter in hard-to-detect forms, such as black holes or rogue planets,
					have not been borne out by research. It is now thought that dark matter
					comprises so-called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The properties
					of these hypothetical subatomic particles are still unknown &ndash; they are not only
					dark and transparent, but they do not interact with normal matter or radiation
					except through gravity.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 1990s, it has become clear that even dark matter is dwarfed by
					“dark energy”. This phenomenon is the force accelerating the expansion of the
						<a href="#calibre_link-32" class="calibre3">Universe</a>, and its nature is still unknown &ndash; it may be an
					integral feature of space-time itself, or a fifth fundamental force known as
					“quintessence”. Dark energy is thought to account for 68.3 per cent of all the

The
					“a-machine” (“a” for automatic) was a long paper tape divided into squares, with
					one number, letter, or symbol in each square, and a read/print tape head. With
					instructions in the form of a table of rules, the tape head reads the symbol of
					the square it sees, and alters it by erasing and printing another, or leaves it
					alone, as per the rules. It then moves to one square either to the left or
					right, and repeats the procedure. Each time there is a different overall
					configuration of the machine, with a new sequence of symbols.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process can be compared to the number-sorting algorithm above. This
					algorithm is constructed for one particular task. Similarly, Turing envisaged a
					range of machines, each with a set of instructions or rules for a particular
					undertaking. He added, “We have only to regard the rules as being capable of
					being taken out and exchanged for others and we have something very akin to a
					universal computing machine.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now known as the Universal Turing Machine (UTM), this device had an infinite
					store (memory) containing both instructions and data. The UTM could therefore
					simulate any Turing machine. What Turing called changing the rules would now be
					called programming. In this way, Turing first introduced the concept of the
					programmable computer, adaptable for many tasks, with input, processing of

				nature of chemical bonds. Pauling had studied quantum mechanics in Europe with the
				German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and
				with Erwin Schrödinger in Zurich. He had already decided that he wanted to
				investigate the bonding within molecules, and realized that quantum mechanics gave
				him the right tools to do so.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-781"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000027.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-782" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hybridization of orbitals</h2></div><p class="calibre12">When he returned to the USA, Pauling published about 50 papers, and, in 1929,
					he laid down a set of five rules for interpreting the X-ray diffraction patterns
					of complicated crystals, now known as Pauling’s rules. At the same time, he was
					turning his attention to the bonding between atoms in covalent molecules
					(molecules in which atoms are bonded by sharing two electrons with each other),
					especially of organic compounds &ndash; those based on carbon.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;A carbon atom has six electrons in total. The European pioneers of quantum
					mechanics designated the first two as “1s-electrons”: these have a spherical
					orbital or shell around the carbon nucleus &ndash; like a balloon inflated around a
					golf ball in the centre. Outside the 1s shell is another shell containing two
					“2s-electrons”. The 2s shell is like another, bigger balloon outside the first.
					Lastly, there are “p-orbitals”, which have big lobes sticking out either side of
					the nucleus. The px orbital lies on the x-axis, the
						py on the y axis, and the pz
					orbital on the z-axis. The last two electrons of the carbon atom occupy two of
					these orbitals &ndash; perhaps one in px and one in
						py.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The new quantum-mechanical picture of electrons treated their orbits as
					“clouds” of probability densities. It was no longer quite right to think of the
					electrons as points moving around their orbits; rather, their existence was
					smeared across the orbits. This new non-local picture of reality allowed for
					some radical new ideas for chemical bonding. Bonds could either be strong
					“sigma” bonds, in which orbitals overlap head-on, or weaker, more diffuse “pi”
					bonds, in which orbitals are parallel to each other.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauling came up with the idea that in a molecule, as opposed to a bare atom,
					carbon’s atomic orbitals could combine, or “hybridize”, to give stronger bonds
					to other atoms. He showed that the s and p orbitals could hybridize to form four
						sp<sup class="calibre23">3</sup> hybrids, which would all be equivalent, and
					would project from the nucleus towards the corners of a tetrahedron, with
					inter-bond angles of 109.5°. Each sp<sup class="calibre23">3</sup> orbital can
					form a sigma bond with another atom. This is consistent with the fact that all
					the hydrogen atoms in methane (CH4), and all the chlorine
					atoms in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), behave the same
					way.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the structures of various carbon compounds were studied, the four nearest
					neighbouring atoms were often found in a tetrahedral arrangement. The crystal
					structure of diamond was among the first structures to be resolved by X-ray
					crystallography, in 1914. Diamond is pure carbon, and in the crystal each carbon
					atom is bonded to four others by sigma bonds at the corners of a tetrahedron.
					This structure explains diamond’s hardness.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible way for carbon atoms to bond to other atoms is for an
					s-orbital to mix with two p-orbitals to form three
						sp<sup class="calibre23">2</sup> hybrids. These stick out from the nucleus in
					one plane, with angles of 120° between them. This is consistent with the
					geometry of molecules such as ethylene, which has the double-bond structure
						H2C=CH2. Here, a sigma bond is
					formed between the carbon atoms by one of the sp<sup class="calibre23">2</sup>
					hybrids, and a pi bond by the fourth, unhybridized orbital.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, an s-orbital can mix with one p-orbital to form two sp hybrids, whose
					lobes stick out in a straight line, 180° apart. This is consistent with the
					structure of carbon dioxide (CO2), where the sp hybrids
					each form a sigma bond with the oxygen, and a second pi bond is formed by the
					remaining two unhybridized orbitals.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-117"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000004.png" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Electrons</span> orbit an atomic nucleus in

					and the hydrogen atoms all lie in the same xy plane and form an angle of 120°
					with each other. Each carbon atom has one remaining electron in a

					connecting all six carbon atoms. This is a pi bond, and, in it, the electrons
					remain above and below the ring, and away from the <a href="#calibre_link-138" class="calibre3">carbon nuclei</a>.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-788" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Ionic bonding</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Methane and ethylene are gases at room temperature. Benzene and many other
					organic compounds based on carbon are liquids. They have small, lightweight
					molecules that can easily move around in the gas or liquid state. Salts such as
					calcium carbonate and potassium nitrate, by contrast, are almost invariably
					solids, and melt only at high temperatures. And yet a unit of sodium chloride
					(NaCl) has a molecular weight of 62, while benzene has a molecular weight of 78.
					The difference in their behaviour is explained not by their weight, but by their
					structure. Benzene is held together in single molecules by covalent bonds
					between the atoms; that is, each bond comprises one pair of electrons shared
					between two specific atoms.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sodium chloride has quite different properties. The silvery metal sodium burns
					energetically in the greenish gas chlorine to produce the white solid sodium
					chloride. The sodium atom has a stable complete shell of electrons around the
					nucleus, plus one spare electron outside that. The chlorine atom is one electron
					short of a stable complete shell. When they react, an electron is transferred
					from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom, and both acquire stable complete
					shells of electrons, but now the sodium has become a sodium ion
						Na<sup class="calibre23">+</sup>, and chlorine has become the <a href="#calibre_link-139" class="calibre3">chloride</a> ion

					purely ionic, and also compounds in which the bonding is neither purely ionic
					nor purely covalent but somewhere in between. This work led him to develop the
					concept of electronegativity, which to some extent echoed the list of metals in
					decreasing order of electropositivity first introduced by Alessandro Volta in
					1800. Pauling discovered that the covalent bond formed between atoms of two
					different elements (e.g. C&ndash;O) is stronger than might be expected from the
					average of the strengths of C&ndash;C bonds and O&ndash;O bonds. He thought that there must
					be some electrical factor that strengthened the bond, and set out to calculate
					values for this factor. The scale is now known as the Pauling scale.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The electronegativity of an element (strictly speaking in a particular
					compound) is a measure of how strongly an atom of the element attracts electrons
					towards itself. The most electronegative element is fluorine; the least
					electronegative (or the most electropositive) of the well-known elements is
					caesium. In the compound caesium fluoride, each fluorine atom pulls an electron
					entirely away from a caesium atom, resulting in an ionic compound
						Cs<sup class="calibre23">+</sup>F<sup class="calibre23">-</sup>.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In a covalent compound such as water (H2O), there are
					no ions, but oxygen is much more electronegative than hydrogen, and the result
					is that the water molecule is polar, with a small negative charge on the oxygen
					atom and a small positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. The charges make the

				would step forward to lead the scientific drive that would usher in this new era.
				For J Robert Oppenheimer, this decision would ultimately destroy him. He was the
				administrator of the largest scientific project the world had seen &ndash; the Manhattan
				Project &ndash; but came to deeply regret his part in it.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-794"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000182.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-795" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Drive to the centre</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Oppenheimer’s varied professional life had been characterized by a ruthless
					drive to “be where it’s at” and this compulsion took the newly graduated Harvard
					man to Europe, the centre of a blossoming of theoretical physics. At Göttingen
					University, Germany, in 1926, he produced the Born&ndash;Oppenheimer approximation
					with Max Born, used to explain, as Oppenheimer put it, “why molecules are
					molecules”. This method extended quantum mechanics beyond single atoms to
					describe the energy of chemical compounds. It was an ambitious mathematical
					exercise as a dizzying range of possibilities for each electron in a molelcule
					had to be computed. Oppenheimer’s work in Germany has proved crucial to
					calculating energy in modern chemistry, but the final breakthrough that would
					lead to the atomic bomb came after he had returned to the USA.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-796" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Fission and black holes</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The chain reaction that led to the building of the atomic bomb began in
					mid-December 1938, when German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann “split
					the atom” in their Berlin laboratory. They had been firing neutrons at uranium,
					but instead of creating heavier elements by neutron absorption, or lighter
					elements by emission of one or more nucleons (protons or neutrons), the pair
					found that the lighter element barium was released, which had 100 fewer nucleons
					than the uranium nucleus. No nuclear process understood at the time could
					account for the loss of 100 nucleons.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexed, Hahn sent a letter to colleagues Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in
					Copenhagen. Within the month, Meitner and Frisch had worked out the basic
					mechanism of nuclear fission, recognizing how uranium was split into barium and
					krypton, the missing nucleons were converted into energy, and a chain reaction
					could follow. In 1939, Danish physicist Niels Bohr took the news to the USA. His
					account, along with the publication of the Meitner&ndash;Frisch paper in the journal
						<i class="calibre11">Nature</i>, set the East Coast scientific
					community ablaze with excitement. Conversations between Bohr and John Archibald
					Wheeler at Princeton after the annual Theoretical Physics Conference, led to the
					Bohr&ndash;Wheeler theory of nuclear fission.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;All the atoms of the same element have nuclei with the same number of protons
					in them, but the number of neutrons can vary, making different isotopes of the
					same element. In the case of uranium, there are two naturally occurring
					isotopes. Uranium-238 (U-238) makes up 99.3 per cent of natural uranium. Its
					nuclei contain 92 protons and 146 neutrons. The remaining 0.7 per cent is made
					up of uranium-235 (U-235), whose nuclei contain 92 protons and 143 neutrons. The
					Bohr&ndash;Wheeler theory incorporated the finding that low-energy neutrons could
					cause fission in U-235, causing the atom to split and releasing energy in the
					process.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the news reached the West Coast, Oppenheimer, now at Berkeley, was
					captivated. He gave a series of lectures and seminars on the brand new theory
					and quickly saw the potential for making a weapon of awesome power &ndash; to his mind
					“a good, honest, practical way” to use the new science. But while laboratories
					in East Coast universities raced to replicate the results of early fission
					experiments, Oppenheimer concentrated on his research into stars contracting and
					collapsing under their own gravity to form black holes.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-797"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000119.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The nuclear fission</span> of uranium-235

							in more atoms, causing a chain reaction. Each time an atom splits,
							energy is released.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-798" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Birth of the idea</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The idea of a nuclear weapon was already in the air. As early as 1913, H G
					Wells wrote of “tapping the internal energy of atoms” to make “atomic bombs”. In
					his novel <i class="calibre11">The World Set Free</i>, the innovation
					was set to happen in the year 1933. In 1933 itself, Ernest Rutherford touched on
					the large amount of energy released during nuclear fission in a speech printed
					in <i class="calibre11">The Times</i> of London. However, Rutherford
					dismissed the idea of harnessing this energy as “moonshine”, since the process
					was so inefficient it required much more energy than it released.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a Hungarian living in Britain named Leó Szilárd to see how it could be
					done, and also to realize the horrific consequences for a world heading towards
					war. Pondering Rutherford’s lecture, Szilárd saw that the “secondary neutrons”
					emerging from the first fission event could themselves create further fission
					events, resulting in an escalating chain reaction of nuclear fission. Szilárd
					later recalled, “There was little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for
					grief.”</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments in Germany and the US showed that the chain reaction was indeed
					possible, prompting Szilárd and another Hungarian emigré, Edward Teller, to
					approach Albert Einstein with a letter. Einstein passed the letter on to US
					President Roosevelt on 11 October 1939 and just ten days later the Advisory
					Committee on Uranium was set up to investigate the possibility of developing the
					bomb in the United States first.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-799" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Birth of Big Science</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The Manhattan Project that arose from this resolution was science on the
					grandest scale imaginable. A multi-armed organization that spread over several
					large sites in the USA and Canada and countless smaller facilities, it employed
					130,000 people and by its close had swallowed in excess of US$2 billion (more
					than US$26bn, or £16bn, in 2014 money) &ndash; all in top secrecy.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1941, the decision was taken to pursue five separate methods of
					producing fissionable material for a bomb: electromagnetic separation, gaseous
					diffusion, and thermal diffusion to separate isotopes of uranium-235 from
					uranium-238; and two lines of research into nuclear reactor technology. On 2
					December 1942, the very first controlled chain reaction involving nuclear
					fission was carried out in a squash court at the University of Chicago. Enrico
					Fermi’s Chicago Pile-1 was the prototype for the reactors that would enrich
					uranium and create the newly discovered plutonium &ndash; an unstable element that is
					even heavier than uranium, can also cause a rapid chain reaction, and can be
					used to create an even deadlier bomb.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre16">"We have made a thing, a most terrible weapon, that has altered abruptly

					Nobel laureates ever gathered in one place.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since much of the important science had already been done, many of the Los
					Alamos scientists dismissed their work in the New Mexico desert as merely a
					“problem of engineering”. However, it was Oppenheimer’s coordination of 3,000
					scientists that made the construction of the bomb possible.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-801" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Change of heart</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The successful Trinity test on 16 July 1945 and subsequent detonation of a
					bomb called “Little Boy” above Hiroshima in Japan on 6 August 1945 left
					Oppenheimer jubilant. However, the event was to cast a long shadow over the Los
					Alamos director. Germany had already surrendered by the time the bomb was
					dropped, and many Los Alamos scientists felt a public demonstration of the bomb
					was all that was necessary &ndash; after seeing its awesome power, Japan would be sure
					to surrender. However, while Hiroshima was believed by some to be a necessary
					evil, the detonation of a plutonium device &ndash; called “Fat Man” &ndash; over Nagasaki on
					9 August was hard to justify. A year later, Oppenheimer publicly stated his
					opinion that the atom bombs had been dropped on a defeated enemy.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1945, Oppenheimer met President Harry S Truman and told him, “I
					feel I have blood on my hands”. Truman was furious. Congressional hearings
					stripped the scientist of his security clearance in 1954, ending his ability to
					influence public policy.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, Oppenheimer had overseen the advent of the military&ndash;industrial

				being employed in almost every field of science, from telescopes to chemical
				analysis. New technology has widened the possibilities for calculation and
				experiment. The first computers were built in the 1940s, and a new science,
				Artificial Intelligence, has emerged. CERN’s Large Hadron Collider &ndash; a particle
				accelerator &ndash; is the biggest piece of scientific equipment ever made. Powerful
				microscopes have allowed the first direct glimpses of atoms, while new telescopes

					Stanley Miller set up an ingenious experiment to find out whether life could
					have started on Earth when lightning sparked chemical reactions in the
					atmosphere. In the same year, two molecular biologists &ndash; American James Watson
					and Briton Francis Crick &ndash; in a race against rival teams in the USA and Soviet
					Union, worked out the molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA,
					providing the key to the genetic code of life, which would lead less than half a
					century later to the complete mapping of the human genome.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with new knowledge about the genetic mechanism, American biologist Lynn
					Margulis proposed the apparently absurd theory that some organisms can be
					absorbed by others, while both continue to flourish, and that this process had
					produced the complex cells of all multicellular life forms. After years of
					scepticism, she was vindicated by discoveries in genetics made 20 years after
					her proposal. American microbiologist Michael Syvanen showed how genes can jump
					from one species to another, while in the 1990s, the old Lamarckian idea that
					acquired characteristics can be passed on gained new traction with the discovery
					of epigenetics. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which evolution can take place
					was becoming far richer.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the century, American Craig Venter, fresh from running his own
					human genome project, had created artificial life by planning its DNA on his
					computer. In Scotland, after many setbacks, Ian Wilmut and colleagues had
					succeeded in cloning a sheep.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-807" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New particles</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In physics, the strangeness of quantum mechanics was further explored by
					American Richard Feynman and others, who explained quantum interactions in terms
					of exchange of “virtual” particles. Paul Dirac had correctly predicted the
					existence of antimatter in the 1930s, and in subsequent decades, more new
					subatomic particles emerged from the collisions of ever more powerful particle
					colliders. From this menagerie of exotic particles, the standard model of
					particle physics emerged, arranging the fundamental particles of nature
					according to their properties. Not all physicists were convinced, but the power
					of the standard model received a huge boost in 2012 when the Higgs boson it had
					predicted was detected by CERN’s Large Hadron Collider.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the search for a “theory of everything” &ndash; a theory that would unite
					all four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong
					and weak nuclear forces) &ndash; took many new directions. American Sheldon Glashow
					united electromagnetism with the weak nuclear force into one “electroweak”
					theory, while string theory attempted to unite every theory of physics into one
					by proposing the existence of six hidden dimensions in addition to the three of
					space and one of time. American physicist Hugh Everett III suggested that there
					may be a mathematical basis for the existence of more than one universe.
					Everett’s theory of a constantly splitting multiverse was at first ignored, but
					has gained supporters over the last few years.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-808" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Future directions</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Deep puzzles remain to be solved, including an elusive theory that would unite
					quantum mechanics with general relativity. But tantalizing possibilities are
					also opening up, including a potential revolution in computing courtesy of the
					quantum mechanical qubit. It is probable that new problems we cannot even
					imagine will emerge. If the history of science is a guide, we should expect the
					unexpected.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					rapid, high-temperature cycle that dominates in more massive stars. Between 1946
					and 1957, British astronomer Fred Hoyle and others developed Bethe’s ideas to
					show how further fusion reactions involving helium could generate carbon and
					heavier elements up to and including the mass of iron. This explained the origin
					of many of the Universe’s heavier elements. We now know that elements heavier
					than iron form in supernova explosions &ndash; the death-throes of massive stars. The

					range of data on the inheritance of kernel colour. McClintock combined breeding
					experiments with microscope work on chromosomes. In 1930, she found that, during
					sexual reproduction, chromosomes paired up when sex cells were formed, creating
					an X shape. She realized that these X-shaped structures marked locations where
					chromosome pairs were exchanging segments. Genes that were once linked together
					on the same chromosome were shuffled around, which resulted in new traits,

				electrodynamics (QED), explained the interaction of particles through the exchange
				of electromagnetism. It has proved very successful, although one of its pioneers,
				Richard Feynman, called it a “strange” theory because the picture of the Universe
				that it describes is hard to visualize.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-818"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000319.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-819" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Messenger particles</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Paul Dirac made the first step towards a theory of QED based on the idea that
					electrically charged particles interacted through the exchange of quanta, or
					“photons”, of electromagnetic energy &ndash; the same electromagnetic quanta that
					comprise light. Photons can be created out of nothing for very brief periods of
					time in accordance with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, and this allows
					fluctuations in the amount of energy available in “empty” space. Such photons
					are sometimes called “virtual” particles, and physicists have subsequently
					confirmed their involvement in electromagnetism. More generally, the messenger
					particles in quantum field theories are known as “gauge bosons”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were problems with QED. Most significantly, its equations often

					so that they mirrored real laboratory results. In the late 1940s, Japanese
					physicist Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Americans Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman,
					and others took Bethe’s ideas and developed them to produce a mathematically
					sound version of QED. It produced meaningful results by considering all the
					possible ways that interactions could take place according to quantum
					mechanics.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Feynman made this complex subject approachable through his invention of
					“Feynman diagrams” &ndash; simple pictorial representations of possible
					electromagnetic interactions between particles, which provide an intuitive
					description of the processes at work. The key breakthrough was to find a
					mathematical way of modelling an interaction as a sum of the probabilities of
					each individual pathway, which include pathways in which particles move
					backwards in time. When summed, many of the probabilities cancel each other out:
					for instance, the probability of a particle travelling in a particular direction
					may be the same as the probability of it travelling in the opposite direction,
					so adding these probabilities gives a sum of zero. Summing every possibility,
					including the “strange” ones involving backwards time travel, produces familiar
					results such as light appearing to travel in straight lines. However, under
					certain conditions, the summed probabilities do produce strange results, and
					experiments have shown that light does not always necessarily travel in straight
					lines. As such, QED provides an accurate description of reality even if it feels
					alien to the world we perceive.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;QED proved so successful that it has become a model for similar theories of
					other fundamental forces &ndash; the strong nuclear force has been successfully
					described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), while the electromagnetic and weak
					nuclear forces have been unified in a combined electroweak gauge theory. Only
					gravitation so far refuses to conform to this kind of model.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-822"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">RICHARD FEYNMAN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-823"><img alt="" src="images/000292.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Born in New York in 1918, Richard Feynman showed a talent for mathematics at

				some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat,
				electricity etc present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to
				undergo still more complex changes…” In 1953, American chemist Harold Urey and his
				student Stanley Miller found a way to replicate Earth’s early atmosphere in the
				laboratory, and generated from inorganic matter organic (carbon-based) compounds
				that are essential to life.</p><p class="calibre15">Before the Urey&ndash;Miller experiment, advances in chemistry and astronomy had
				analysed the atmospheres on the other, lifeless planets in the Solar System. In the
				1920s, Soviet biochemist Alexander Oparin and British geneticist J B S Haldane
				independently suggested that if conditions on prebiotic (pre-life) Earth resembled
				those planets, then simple chemicals could have reacted together in a primordial
				soup to form more complex molecules, from which living things might have
				evolved.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-826"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000243.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-827" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Recreating Earth’s early atmosphere</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In 1953, Urey and Miller carried out the first prolonged experiment to test
					the Oparin&ndash;Haldane theory. In a closed series of connected glass flasks, sealed
					from the atmosphere, they placed water and a mixture of gases thought to have
					been present in Earth’s primitive atmosphere &ndash; hydrogen, methane, and ammonia.
					The water was heated so that water vapour formed and wafted its way round all
					the flasks in the closed loop. In one of the flasks was a pair of electrodes,
					between which sparks were passed continuously to represent lightning &ndash; one of
					the hypothetical triggers for primordial reactions. The sparks provided enough
					energy to break up some of the molecules, and so generate highly reactive forms
					that would go on to react with other molecules.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a day, the mixture had turned pink, and after two weeks Urey and Miller
					found that at least 10 per cent of the carbon (from the methane) was now in the
					form of other organic compounds. Two per cent of the carbon had formed amino
					acids, which are the vital building blocks of the proteins in all living things.
					Urey encouraged Miller to send a paper about the experiment to the journal
						<i class="calibre11">Science</i>, which published it as
					“Production of amino acids under possible primitive earth conditions”. The world
					could now imagine how Darwin’s “warm little pond” may have generated the first
					life forms.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview, Miller said that “just turning on the spark in a basic
					prebiotic experiment will yield amino acids”. Scientists later found, using
					better equipment than was available in 1953, that the original experiment had
					produced at least 25 amino acids &ndash; more than are found in nature. Since Earth’s
					early atmosphere almost certainly contained carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen
					sulphide, and sulphur dioxide released from volcanoes, a much richer mixture of
					organic compounds might well have been created then &ndash; and was indeed formed in
					subsequent experiments. Meteorites containing dozens of amino acids, some found
					on Earth and others not, have also spurred on the search for signs of life on

				structure of deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA), the molecule that contains the genetic
				information.</p><p class="calibre15">The article was written by James Watson, a 29-year-old American biologist, and his

				the Soviet Union were vying to be the first to “crack” DNA’s three-dimensional shape
				&ndash; the elusive model that allowed DNA simultaneously to carry genetic data in some
				kind of chemically coded form, and to replicate itself completely and accurately, so
				that the same genetic data was passed to offspring, or daughter cells, including
				those of the next generation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-832"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000165.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-833" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The past in DNA</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The DNA molecule was not discovered in 1953, as is often popularly thought,
					nor were Crick and Watson the first to find out what it was made from. DNA has a
					much longer history of research. In the 1880s, the German biologist Walther
					Flemming had reported that “X”-like bodies (later named chromosomes) appeared
					inside cells as the cells were preparing to divide. In 1900, Gregor Mendel’s
					experiments with heredity in pea plants were rediscovered &ndash; Mendel had been the
					first to suggest that there were units of heredity that came in pairs (which
					would later be called genes). At about the same time as Mendel was being
					rediscovered, breeding experiments by American physician Walter Sutton and,
					independently, by German biologist Theodor Boveri revealed that sets of
					chromosomes (the rod-shaped structures that carry genes) pass from a dividing
					cell to each of its daughter cells. The ensuing Sutton&ndash;Boveri theory proposed
					that chromosomes are the carriers of genetic material.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, more scientists were investigating these mysterious X-shaped bodies. In
					1915, American biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that chromosomes were indeed
					the carriers of hereditary information. The next step was to look at the
					constituent molecules of chromosomes &ndash; molecules that might be candidates for
					genes.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"So beautiful it has to be true."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">James Watson</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-834" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New pairs of genes</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In the 1920s, two types of candidate molecules were discovered: proteins
					called histones, and nucleic acids, which had been described chemically in 1869
					as <i class="calibre11">nuclein</i> by Swiss biologist Friedrich
					Miescher. The Russian-American biochemist Phoebus Levene and others gradually
					identified the main ingredients of DNA in increasing detail as nucleotide units,
					each made up of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and one of four sub-units
					called bases. By the end of the 1940s, the basic formula of DNA as a giant
					polymer &ndash; a huge molecule consisting of repeating units, or monomers &ndash; was
					clear. By 1952, experiments with bacteria had shown that DNA itself, and not its
					rival candidates, the proteins inside chromosomes, was the physical embodiment
					of genetic information.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-835" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Tricky research tools</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The competing researchers were using several advanced research tools,
					including X-ray diffraction crystallography, in which X-rays were passed through
					a substance’s crystals. A crystal’s unique geometry in terms of its atomic
					content made the X-ray beams diffract, or bend, as they passed through. The
					resulting diffraction patterns of spots, lines, and blurs were captured on
					photographic film. Working backwards from those patterns, it was possible to
					work out the structural details within the crystal. This was not an easy task.
					X-ray crystallography has been likened to studying the myriad light patterns
					cast by a crystal chandelier on the ceiling and walls of a large room, and using
					them to work out the shapes and positions of each piece of glass in the
					chandelier.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"It is one of the more striking generalizations of biochemistry…that the

					American researchers, led by Linus Pauling. In 1951, Pauling and his colleagues
					Robert Corey and Herman Branson had already achieved a breakthrough in molecular
					biology when they correctly proposed that many biological molecules &ndash; including
					haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying substance in blood &ndash; have a corkscrew-like
					helix shape. Pauling named this molecular model the alpha helix.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauling’s breakthrough had pipped the Cavendish Laboratory at the post, and it
					looked as though the precise shape of DNA’s structure was within his grasp.
					Then, early in 1953, Pauling proposed that the structure of DNA was in the form
					of a triple helix.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time, James Watson was working at the Cavendish Laboratory. He was
					only 25 years old, but he had the enthusiasm of youth and two degrees in
					zoology, and had studied the genes and nucleic acids of bacteriophages &ndash; the
					viruses that infect bacteria. Crick, aged 37, was a biophysicist with an
					interest in the brain and neuroscience. He had studied proteins, nucleic acids,
					and other giant molecules in living things. He had also observed the Cavendish
					team racing to beat Pauling to the alpha helix idea, and later analysed their
					mistaken suppositions and dead-end exploratory efforts.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Watson and Crick also had experience of X-ray crystallography, albeit in
					different areas, and together they soon began musing on two questions that
					fascinated them both: how does DNA as a physical molecule encode genetic
					information, and how is this information translated into the parts of a living
					system?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-837"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000138.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This X-ray diffraction</span> photograph of

					proteins, in which the molecule twisted along a single corkscrew path, repeating
					its main structure every 3.6 turns. They also knew that the latest research
					evidence did not seem to support Pauling’s triple helix model for DNA. This led
					them to wonder whether the elusive model was one that was neither a single nor a
					triple helix. The two conducted hardly any experiments themselves. Instead they
					collected data from others, including the results of chemical experiments that
					gave information about the angles of the links, or bonds, between the various
					ingredient atoms and subgroups of DNA. They also pooled their joint knowledge of
					X-ray crystallography and approached those researchers who had made the
					highest-quality images of DNA and other similar molecules. One such image was
					“photo 51”, which became key to their achieving their breakthrough.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Photo 51 was an X-ray diffraction image of DNA that resembled an “X” seen
					through the slats of a Venetian blind &ndash; fuzzy to our eyes, but at that time,
					among the sharpest and most informative of DNA’s X-ray pictures. Some debate
					surrounds the identity of the photographer who took this historic picture. It
					came from the laboratory of a British biophysicist named Rosalind Franklin, an
					expert in X-ray crystallography, and her graduate student Raymond Gosling, at
					King’s College, London. Each has been credited with the image at various
					times.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre16">"We have discovered the secret of life."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Francis Crick</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-839" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cardboard models</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Also working at King’s was Maurice Wilkins, a physicist who was interested in
					molecular biology. In early 1953, in what was perhaps a break with scientific
					protocol, Wilkins showed the images taken by Franklin and Gosling, without their
					permission or knowledge, to James Watson. The American immediately recognized
					their significance, and took the implications straight back to Crick. Suddenly
					their work was on the right path.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point, the exact sequence of events becomes unclear, and later
					accounts of the discovery are conflicting. Franklin had described in unpublished
					draft reports her thoughts about the structure and shape of DNA. These were also
					incorporated by Watson and Crick as they struggled with their various proposals.
					The main idea, derived from Pauling’s alpha helix model and supported by
					Wilkins, centred on some form of repeating helical pattern for the giant
					molecule.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Franklin’s considerations was whether the structural “backbone”, a
					chain of phosphate and deoxyribose sugar sub-units, was in the centre with the
					bases projecting outwards, or the other way around. Another colleague who
					provided help was Austrian-born British biologist Max Perutz, who would win the
					Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1962 for his work on the structure of haemoglobin
					and other proteins. Perutz also had access to Franklin’s unpublished reports and
					passed them on to the ever-networking Watson and Crick. They pursued the idea
					that DNA’s backbones were on the outside, with the bases pointing inwards and
					perhaps joining to each other in pairs. They cut out and shuffled around
					cardboard shapes that represented these molecular sub-units: phosphates and
					sugars in the backbone, and the four types of base &ndash; adenine, thymine, guanine,
					and cytosine.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1952, Watson and Crick had met Erwin Chargaff, an Austrian-born biochemist,
					who had devised what became known as Chargaff’s first rule. This stated that in
					DNA, the amounts of guanine and cytosine are equal, as are the amounts of
					adenine and thymine. Experiments had sometimes shown that all four amounts were
					roughly equal, and sometimes not. The latter findings came to be seen as errors
					in methodology, and equal amounts of all four bases came to be accepted as the
					rule of thumb.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-840"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000313.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Rosalind Franklin’s</span> draft reports on

					light on the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick now began to think of adenine as
					only and always linking to thymine, and guanine to cytosine. In assembling the
					cardboard pieces for their 3-D jigsaw, Watson and Crick were juggling a vast
					amount of data, working from mathematics, X-ray images, their own knowledge of
					chemical bonds and their angles, and other data &ndash; all approximate and subject to
					ranges of errors. Their final breakthrough came when they realized that making
					slight adjustments to the configurations of thymine and guanine allowed the
					pieces to fit together, producing an elegant double helix in which the pairs of
					bases linked along the middle. Unlike the protein alpha helix, which had 3.6
					sub-units in one complete turn, DNA had about 10.4 sub-units per turn.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The model that Watson and Crick described consisted of two helical or
					corkscrew phosphate-sugar backbones curling around each other, like the uprights
					of a “twisted ladder”, joined by pairs of bases serving as rungs. The sequence
					of bases worked like letters in a sentence, carrying small units of information
					that combined to make an overall instruction, or gene &ndash; which in turn told the
					cell how to make the particular protein or other molecule that was the physical
					manifestation of the genetic data and had a particular role in the cell’s fabric
					and function.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-842"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000089.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">These are</span> human male chromosomes.

These are
					made and broken relatively easily, so the sections of the double-helix can be
					“unzipped” by undoing the bonds, which then exposes the code of bases as a
					template for making a copy.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This zip-unzip allowed two processes to occur. First, a mirror complementary
					copy of nucleic acid could be made from one unzipped half of the double helix;
					then, carrying its genetic information as the sequence of bases, it would leave
					the cell nucleus to become involved in the protein production.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when the whole length of the double helix was unzipped, each part
					would act as a template to build a new complementary partner &ndash; resulting in two
					lengths of DNA that were identical to the original and to each other. In this
					way, DNA was copied as cells divided into two for growth and repair throughout
					an organism’s life &ndash; and as sperm and eggs, the sex cells, carried their
					quotient of the genes to make a fertilized egg, so beginning the next
					generation.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-844" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">“Secret of life”</h2></div><p class="calibre12">On 28 February 1953, elated by their discovery, Watson and Crick went for
					lunch to The Eagle, one of Cambridge’s oldest inns, where colleagues from the
					Cavendish and other laboratories often met. Crick is said to have startled
					drinkers by announcing that he and Watson had discovered “the secret of life” &ndash;
					or so Watson later recalled in his book, <i class="calibre11">The Double
						Helix</i>, though Crick denied this really happened.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology
					or Medicine “for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic
					acids and its significance for information transfer in living material”. The
					award, however, was surrounded in controversy. In the preceding years, Rosalind
					Franklin had received little official credit for producing the key X-ray images
					and for writing the reports that helped to direct Watson and Crick’s research.
					She died of ovarian cancer in 1958, aged only 37, and was therefore ineligible
					for the Nobel Prize in 1962, since the prizes are not awarded posthumously. Some
					said the award should have been made earlier, with Franklin as one of the
					co-recipients, but the rules allow a maximum of three.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Following their momentous work, Watson and Crick became world celebrities.
					They continued their research in molecular biology and received great numbers of
					awards and honours. Now that the structure of DNA was known, the next big
					challenge was to solve the genetic “code”. By 1964, scientists worked out how
					sequences of its bases were translated into the amino acids that make up
					specific proteins and other molecules that are the building blocks of
					life.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, scientists can identify base sequences for all the genes of an
					organism, collectively known as its genome. They can manipulate DNA to move
					genes around, delete them from specific lengths of DNA, and insert them into
					others. In 2003, the Human Genome Project, the largest international biological
					research project ever, announced that it had completed the mapping of the human
					genome &ndash; a sequence of more than 20,000 genes. Crick and Watson’s discovery had
					paved the way for genetic engineering and gene therapy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-845"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000066.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">A DNA molecule</span> is a double helix formed

				by Erwin Schrödinger’s wavefunction, but the phenomenon of many possibilities
				disappears as soon as it is observed. The very act of measuring a quantum system

					measurement problem with what became known as the Copenhagen interpretation. It
					holds that the act of making an observation on a quantum system causes the
					wavefunction to “collapse” into the single outcome. Although this remains a
					widely accepted interpretation, many theorists find it unsatisfactory since it
					reveals nothing about the mechanism of wavefunction collapse. This bothered
					Schrödinger, too. For him, any mathematical formulation of the world had to have
					an objective reality. As Irish physicist John Bell put it, “Either the
					wavefunction, as given by the Schrödinger equation, is not everything, or is not
					right.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-852"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000380.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">“Multiverse” is an installation</span> of 41,000

					presumed the objective reality of the wavefunction and removed the (unobserved)

					someone makes a measurement? He then asked another question: what then happens
					to the various options available to quantum systems? The MWI says that all
					possibilities do, in fact, occur. Reality peels itself, or splits, into new
					worlds, but since we inhabit a world where only one outcome occurs, this is what
					we see. Other possible outcomes are inaccessible to us, since there can be no
					interference between worlds and we are fooled into thinking that something is
					lost every time we measure something.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;While Everett’s theory is not accepted by all, it removes a theoretical block
					to interpreting quantum mechanics. MWI does not mention parallel universes, but
					they are its logical prediction. It has been criticized for being untestable,
					but this may change. An effect known as “decoherence” &ndash; whereby quantum objects
					“leak” their superposition information &ndash; is a mechanism by which MWI might be

				Minicomputers would not arrive until 1965 and microchips as we know them today were
				several years in the future. With computer hardware so huge and specialized, British
				research scientist Donald Michie decided to use simple physical objects for a small
				project on machine learning and artificial intelligence &ndash; matchboxes and glass
				beads. He selected a simple task, too &ndash; the game of noughts-and-crosses, also known
				as tic-tac-toe. Or, as Michie called it “tit-tat-to”. The result was the Matchbox
				Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine (MENACE).</p><p class="calibre15">Michie’s main version of MENACE comprised 304 matchboxes glued together in a
				chest-of-drawers arrangement. A code number on each box was keyed into a chart. The
				chart showed drawings of the 3x3 game grid with various arrangements of Os and Xs,
				corresponding to possible layout permutations as the game progressed. There are
				actually 19,683 possible layout combinations but some can be rotated to give others,
				and some are mirror-images of, or symmetrical to, each other. This made 304
				permutations an adequate working number.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;In each matchbox box were beads of nine different kinds, distinguished by colour.
				Each colour of bead corresponded to MENACE putting its O on a certain one of the
				nine squares. For example, a green bead meant O in the lower left square, a red one
				designated O in the central square, and so on.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-857"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000326.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"Can machines think?

In the tray of each matchbox were two
					extra pieces of card at one end forming a “V” shape. To play, the tray was
					removed from the box, jiggled, and tilted so the V was at the lower end. The
					beads randomly rolled down and one nestled into the apex of the V. Thus chosen,
					this bead’s colour determined the position of MENACE’s first O in the grid. This
					bead was then put aside, and the tray replaced in its box but left slightly
					open.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the opponent positioned their first X. For the second turn of MENACE,
					the matchbox was selected that corresponded to the positions of the X and O on
					the grid at this time. Again the matchbox was opened, the tray shaken and
					tilted, and the colour of the randomly selected bead determined the position of
					MENACE’s second O. The opponent placed their second X. And so on, recording
					MENACE’s sequence of beads and so moves.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-859"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000299.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Each of the 304</span> matchboxes in MENACE
							represented a possible state of the board. The beads inside the boxes
							represented each possible move for that state. The bead at the bottom of
							the “V” determined the move. As games went on, winning beads were
							reinforced and losing ones removed, allowing MENACE to learn from its
							experience.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-860" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Win, lose, draw</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Eventually there came a result. If MENACE won, it received reinforcement or a
					“reward”. The removed beads showed the sequence of winning moves. Each of these
					beads was put back in its box, identified by the code number and slightly open
					tray. The tray also received three extra “bonus” beads of the same colour. As a
					consequence, in a future game, if the same permutation of Os and Xs occurred on
					the grid, this matchbox would come into play again &ndash; and it had more of the
					beads that previously led to a win. The chances of choosing that bead, and so
					the same move and another possible win, were increased.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;If MENACE lost it was “punished” by not receiving back the removed beads,
					which represented the losing sequence of moves. But this was still positive. In
					future games, if the same permutation of Xs and Os cropped up, the beads
					designating the same move as the previous time were either fewer in number or
					absent, thereby lessening the chance of another loss.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;For a draw, each bead from that game was replaced in its relevant box, along
					with a small reward, one bonus bead of the same colour. This increased the
					chances of that bead being selected if the same permutation came round again,
					but not so much as the win with three bonus beads.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Michie’s aim was that MENACE would “learn from experience”. For given
					permutations of Os and Xs, when a certain sequence of moves had been successful,
					it should gradually become more likely, while moves that led to losses would
					become less likely. It should progress by trial and error, adapt with
					experience, and with more games, become more successful.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-861"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000272.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Colossus</span>, the world’s first electronic

					decreed that MENACE’s O should be placed on a square already occupied by an O or
					X? Michie accounted for this by ensuring that each matchbox contained only beads
					corresponding to empty squares for its particular permutation. So the box for
					the permutation of O top left and X bottom right did not contain beads for
					putting the next O on those squares. Michie considered that putting beads for
					all nine possible O positions in every box would “complicate the problem
					unnecessarily”. It meant MENACE would not only learn to win or draw, it would
					also have to learn the rules as it went along. Such start-up conditions might
					lead to one or two early disasters that collapsed the whole system. This
					demonstrated a principle: machine learning does well to start simple and
					gradually add more sophistication.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Michie also pointed out that when MENACE lost, its last move was the 100 per
					cent fatal one. The move before contributed to the loss, as though backing the
					machine into a corner, but less so &ndash; usually it still left open the possibility
					of escaping defeat. Working back towards the start of the game, each earlier
					move contributed less to the final defeat &ndash; that is, as moves accumulate, the
					probability that each becomes the final one increases. Therefore as the total
					number of moves grows, it becomes more important to get rid of choices that have
					proved fatal.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Michie simulated this by having different numbers of beads for each move. So
					for MENACE’s second move (third move overall), each box that could be called
					upon to play &ndash; those with permutations of one O and one X already in the grid &ndash;
					had three of each kind of bead. For MENACE’s third move, there were two beads of
					each kind, and for its fourth (seventh move overall), just one. A fatal choice
					on the fourth move would result in removal of the only bead specifying that
					position on the grid. Without that bead, the same situation could not
					recur.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"Expert knowledge is intuitive; it is not necessarily accessible to the

Michie was MENACE’s first opponent in a tournament
					of 220 games. MENACE began shakily but soon settled down to draw more often,
					then notch up some wins. To counter, Michie began to stray from safe options and
					employ unusual strategies. MENACE took time to adapt but then began to cope with
					these too, coming back to achieve more draws, then wins. At one point in a
					series of 10 games, Michie lost eight.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;MENACE provided a simple example of machine learning and how altering
					variables could affect the outcome. Michie’s description of MENACE was, in fact,
					part of a longer account that went on to compare its performance with
					trial-and-error animal learning, as Michie explained:</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;‘“Essentially, the animal makes more-or-less random movements and selects, in
					the sense that it subsequently repeats, those which produced the ‘desired’
					result. This description seems tailor-made for the matchbox model. Indeed,
					MENACE constitutes a model of trial-and-error learning in so pure a form, that
					when it shows elements of other categories of learning we may reasonably suspect
					these of contamination with a trial-and-error component.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-864"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000068.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">New computer technology</span> has led to a

					career in biology, surgery, genetics, and embryology. After MENACE, he moved
					into the fast-developing area of artificial intelligence (AI). He developed his
					machine learning ideas into “industrial-strength tools” applied in hundreds of
					situations, including assembly lines, factory production, and steel mills. As
					computers spread, his artificial intelligence work was used to design computer
					programs and control structures that could learn in ways perhaps not even
					guessed at by their human originators. Michie demonstrated that careful
					application of human intelligence empowered machines to make themselves smarter.
					Recent developments in AI use similar principles to develop networks that mirror
					the neural networks of animals’ brains.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Michie also conceived the notion of memoization, in which the result of each
					set of inputs in a machine or computer was stored as a reminder or “memo”. If
					the same set of inputs recurred, the device would at once activate the memo and
					recall the answer, rather than recalculating afresh, thereby saving time and
					resources. He contributed the memoization technique to computer programming
					languages such as POP-2 and LISP.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"He had this concept that he wanted to try out that he thought might

				least to the ancient Greeks. Physicists currently recognize four fundamental forces
				&ndash; gravity, electromagnetism, and the two nuclear forces, weak and strong
				interactions, which hold together the subatomic particles inside the nucleus of an
				atom. We now know that the weak force and the electromagnetic force are different
				manifestations of a single “electroweak” force. Discovering this was an important
				step on the way to finding a “Theory of Everything” that would explain the
				relationship between all four forces.</p><div id="calibre_link-870" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The weak force</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The weak force was first invoked to explain beta decay, a type of nuclear
					radiation in which a neutron turns into a proton inside the nucleus, emitting
					electrons or positrons in the process. In 1961, a graduate student at Harvard,
					Sheldon Glashow, was given the ambitious brief to unify the theories of weak and
					electromagnetic interactions. Glashow fell short of this, but did describe the
					force-carrying particles that mediate interaction via the weak force.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-871"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000382.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-872" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Messenger particles</h2></div><p class="calibre12">In the quantum mechanical description of fields, a force is “felt” by the
					exchange of a gauge boson, such as the photon, which carries electromagnetic
					interaction. A boson is emitted by one particle and absorbed by a second.
					Normally, neither particle is fundamentally changed by this interaction &ndash; an
					electron is still an electron after absorbing or emitting a photon. The weak
					force breaks this symmetry, changing quarks (the particles that protons and
					neutrons are made from) from one kind to another. So what kind of boson might be
					involved? Glashow guessed that the bosons associated with the weak force had to
					be relatively massive because the force operates over miniscule ranges and heavy
					particles do not travel far. He proposed two charged bosons, W+ and W&ndash;, and a
					third neutral Z boson. The W and Z force-carriers were detected by CERN’s
					particle accelerator in 1983.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-873"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000412.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Decay of particles</span> via the weak force

					brought weak interaction and electromagnetic force together as a single
					force.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an astounding result, as the weak and electromagnetic forces operate
					in entirely different spheres. The electromagnetic force extends to the very
					edge of the visible universe (the force is carried by massless photons of
					light), while the weak force barely reaches across an atomic nucleus and is some
					10 million times weaker. Their unification opens up the tantalizing possibility
					that, under certain high-energy conditions such as those just after the Big

				parts per million (ppm). In 1958, American geochemist Charles Keeling began to
				measure the concentration of CO2 using a sensitive instrument

					California, the Olympic peninsula in Washington State, and the high mountain
					forests of Arizona. He also recorded measurements at the South Pole and from
					aircraft. In 1957, Keeling founded a meteorological station at 3,000m (10,000ft)
					above sea level on the top of Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Keeling measured the carbon
					dioxide level at the station regularly, and discovered three things.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there was a daily variation locally. The concentration was at a minimum
					mid-afternoon, when green plants were at their most active in soaking up
						CO2. Second, there was annual variation globally. The
					northern hemisphere had more land for plants to grow, and the level of
						CO2 rose slowly during the northern winter when
					plants were not growing. It reached a peak in May before plants started to grow
					and began soaking up CO2 again. The level dropped to a
					minimum in October, when northern plants died back for winter. Third, crucially,
					the concentration was increasing inexorably. Cores of polar ice contained
					bubbles of air, which showed that during most of the time since 9000 BCE, the
						CO2 concentration varied from 275 to 285 ppm by
					volume. In 1958, Keeling measured 315 ppm; by May 2013, the average
					concentration exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. The increase from 1958 to
					2013 was 85 ppm, meaning that the concentration had increased by 27 per cent in
					55 years. This was the first concrete evidence that the concentration of
						CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is increasing.
						CO2is a greenhouse gas, helping to trap heat from the
					Sun, so increasing CO2 concentration is likely to lead to
					global warming. Keeling found the following: “At the South Pole the
					concentration has increased at the rate of about 1.3 ppm per year…the observed
					rate of increase is nearly that to be expected from the combustion of fossil
					fuel (1.4 ppm).” In other words, humans are at least part of the cause.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-881"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000277.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Keeling’s graph</span> plots the rising levels

					how weather systems evolve. Working on the assumption that ever-larger computers
					would increase the range of predictions, Edward Lorenz, an American

					rounded up the numbers from six decimal places to three. This tiny alteration to
					the initial state had a major impact on the end result. This sensitive
					dependence on initial conditions was named the “butterfly effect” &ndash; the idea

				of life that emerged in the 1850s, asserting that all organisms were made of cells,
				and new cells could only come from existing ones by a process of division. Some of
				their internal components, such as food-making chloroplasts, apparently reproduced
				by division too.</p><p class="calibre15">This last discovery led Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowsky to the idea that
				chloroplasts may once have been independent life forms. Evolutionary and cellular
				biologists asked: how did complex cells arise? The answer lay in endosymbiosis &ndash; a
				theory that was first proposed by Mereschkowsky in 1905, but was only accepted after
				an American biologist called Lynn Sagan (later Margulis) furnished the evidence in
				1967.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex cells with internal structures called organelles &ndash; the nucleus (which
				controls the cell), mitochondria (which release energy), and chloroplasts (which
				conduct photosynthesis) &ndash; are found in animals, plants, and many microbes. These
				cells, now called eukaryotic, evolved from simpler bacterial cells, which lack
				organelles and are now called prokaryotic. Mereschkowsky imagined primordial
				communities of the simpler cells &ndash; some making food by photosynthesis, others
				preying on their neighbours and engulfing them whole. Sometimes the engulfed cells
				were left undigested and, he suggested, became chloroplasts &ndash; but without proof,
				this theory of endosymbiosis (living together and within) faded.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-902"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000075.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-903" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New evidence</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, combined with advances
					in biochemistry, helped biologists to unlock the inner working of cells. By the
					1950s, scientists knew that DNA provided genetic instructions for carrying out
					life processes and was relayed from generation to generation. In eukaryotic
					cells, DNA is packaged in the nucleus, but it is also found in chloroplasts and
					mitochondria.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, Margulis used this discovery as evidence to revive and substantiate
					the endosymbiosis theory. She included the suggestion that there had been an
					oxygen “holocaust” in the early history of life on Earth. About two billion
					years ago, as photosynthesizers flourished, they saturated the world with
					oxygen, which poisoned many of the microbes around at the time. Predatory
					microbes survived by engulfing others that could “soak up” the oxygen in their
					energy-releasing processes. These became mitochondria: the “power packs” of
					cells today. At first, this appeared far-fetched to most biologists, but the
					evidence for Margulis’s theory gradually became persuasive, and it has now been
					widely accepted. For example, the DNA of mitochondria and chloroplasts are made
					from circular molecules &ndash; just like the DNA of living bacteria.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution by cooperation was not something new: Darwin himself had conceived

				Rutherford deduced that an atom’s nucleus is small and dense, with electrons in

				destroyed.</p><p class="calibre15">In 1920, Rutherford named the nucleus of the lightest element, hydrogen, the
				proton. Twelve years later, the neutron was discovered, and a more complex picture
				of nuclei made of protons and neutrons emerged. Then, in the 1930s, a glimpse of

					physicist are “modest” &ndash; they aim to explain merely the “fundamental laws that
					govern all matter in the Universe”. Theorists, he says, “work with pencil,
					paper, and wastebasket, and the most important of those is the last”. By
					contrast, the experimentalist’s principal tool is the particle accelerator, or
					collider.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1932, the first atomic nuclei &ndash; of the element lithium &ndash; were blown apart
					by physicists Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft using a particle accelerator in
					Cambridge, England. Since then, ever more powerful particle accelerators have
					been constructed. These machines boost tiny subatomic particles to nearly the
					speed of light before slamming them into targets or each other. Research is now
					driven by theoretical predictions &ndash; the largest particle accelerator, the Large
					Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, was built primarily to find the
					theoretical <a href="#calibre_link-69" class="calibre3">Higgs boson</a>.
					The LHC is a 27-km (17-mile) ring of superconducting magnets that took 10 years
					to build.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Collisions between subatomic particles splinter them into their core units.
					The energy released is sometimes enough to produce new generations of particles
					that cannot exist under everyday conditions. Showers of short-lived, exotic
					particles spray off these pile-ups, before swiftly annihilating or decaying.
					With ever-increasing energies at their disposal, researchers aim to probe the
					mysteries of matter by getting even closer to the conditions at the birth of
					matter itself &ndash; the Big Bang. The process has been likened to smashing two
					watches together and then sifting through the wrecked pieces in an attempt to
					find out how the timepiece works.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1953, with colliders achieving ever-increasing energies, exotic particles
					not found in ordinary matter seemed to tumble out of thin air. More than 100
					strongly interacting particles were detected, all thought at the time to be

					affected by the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, and the
					weak and strong nuclear forces. All particles with mass are influenced by
					gravity. The electromagnetic force acts on any particle with an electric charge.
					The weak and strong forces operate over the miniscule ranges found within the
					atomic nucleus. Heavyweight particles called “hadrons”, which include the proton
					and neutron, are “strongly interacting” and influenced by all four fundamental
					forces, while the lightweight “leptons”, such as the electron and neutrino, are
					unaffected by the strong force.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gell-Mann made sense of the particle zoo with an octet ordering system he
					called the “Eightfold Way”, a pun on the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path. Just as
					Mendeleev had done when arranging the chemical elements into a periodic table,
					Gell-Mann imagined a chart into which he placed the elementary particles,
					leaving gaps for as yet undiscovered pieces. In an effort to make the most
					economical scheme, he proposed that hadrons contained a new and as-yet-unseen
					fundamental subunit. Since the heavier particles were no longer fundamental,
					this change reduced the number of fundamental particles down to a manageable
					number &ndash; hadrons were now simply combinations of multiple elementary components.
					Gell-Mann, with his penchant for wacky names dubbed this particle a “quark”
					(pronounced “kwork”), after a favourite line from James Joyce’s novel <i class="calibre11">Finnegans Wake</i>.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-913"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000361.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The standard model</span> arranges the

In 1964, a student at
					Caltech, Georg Zweig, had suggested that hadrons were made of four basic parts,
					which he called “aces”. The CERN journal <i class="calibre11">Physics
						Letters</i> refused Zweig’s paper, but that same year published a
					paper by the more senior Gell-Mann outlining the same idea.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gell-Mann’s paper may have been published because he did not suggest that
					there was any underlying reality to the pattern &ndash; he was simply proposing an
					organizing scheme. However, this scheme appeared unsatisfactory, since it
					required quarks to have fractional charges, such as &ndash;1/3 and +2/3. These were
					nonsensical to accepted theory, which only allowed for whole-number charges.
					Gell-Mann realized that if these subunits remained hidden, trapped inside
					hadrons, this didn’t matter. The predicted omega particle (Ω&ndash;), made up of three
					quarks, was detected at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, soon after
					Gell-Mann’s publication. This confirmed the new model, which Gell-Mann has
					insisted should be credited both to him and to Zweig.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, Gell-Mann was doubtful that quarks could ever be isolated. However,
					he is now at pains to say that although he initially saw his quarks as
					mathematical entities, he never ruled out the possibility that quarks might be
					real. Experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) between 1967
					and 1973 scattered electrons off hard granular particles within the proton,
					revealing the reality of quarks in the process.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-915" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The standard model</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The standard model developed from Gell-Mann’s quark model. In this scheme,
					particles are divided into fermions and bosons. Fermions are the building blocks
					of matter, while bosons are force-carrying particles.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fermions are further split into two families of elementary particles &ndash;
					quarks and leptons. Quarks group together in twos and threes to make up the
					composite particles called hadrons. Subatomic particles with three quarks are
					known as baryons, and include protons and neutrons. Those made of a quark and
					antiquark pair are called mesons, and include pions and kaons. In total there
					are six quark “flavours” &ndash; up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. The
					defining characteristic of quarks is that they carry something called “colour
					charge”, which allows them to interact via the strong force. The leptons do not
					carry colour charge and are not affected by the strong force. There are six
					leptons &ndash; the electron, muon, tau, and the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos.
					Neutrinos have no electrical charge and only interact via the weak force, making
					them extremely hard to detect. Each particle also has a corresponding
					“antiparticle” of antimatter.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard model explains forces at the subatomic level as the result of an
					exchange of force-carrying particles known as “gauge bosons”. Each force has its
					own gauge boson: the weak force is mediated by the W+, W&ndash;, and Z bosons; the
					strong electromagnetic force by photons; and the strong force by gluons.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard model is a robust theory and has been verified by experiment,
					notably with the discovery of a Higgs boson &ndash; the particle that gives other
					particles mass &ndash; at CERN in 2012. However, many consider the model inelegant and
					there are problems with it, such as its failure to incorporate dark matter or
					explain gravity in terms of boson interaction. Other questions that remain
					unanswered are why there is a preponderance of matter (rather than antimatter)
					in the Universe, and why there appear to be three generations of matter.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre16">"Our work is a delightful game."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Murray Gell-Mann</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-916"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MURRAY GELL-MANN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-917"><img alt="" src="images/000334.jpg" class="calibre19" /></div><p class="intro">Born in Manhattan, Murray Gell-Mann was a child prodigy.

					together the particles in the nuclei of atoms, and the behaviour of hadrons, the
					composite particles that are subject to the influence of the strong
					force.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, as part of an ongoing study of the properties of hadrons, American
					physicist Geoffrey Chew proposed a radical new approach &ndash; abandoning the
					preconception that hadrons were particles in the traditional sense, and
					modelling their interactions in terms of a mathematical object called an
					S-matrix. When Italian physicist Gabriele Veneziano investigated the results of
					Chew’s model, he found patterns suggesting that particles would appear at points
					along straight one-dimensional lines &ndash; the first hint of what we now call
					strings. In the 1970s, physicists continued to map these strings and their
					behaviour, but their work began to throw up annoyingly complex and
					counter-intuitive results. For instance, particles have a property called spin
					(analogous to angular momentum), which can only take certain values. The initial
					drafts of string theory could produce bosons (particles with zero or
					whole-number spins, typically the “messenger” particles in models of quantum
					forces), but not fermions (particles with half-integer spins, including all
					matter particles). The theory also predicted the existence of particles that
					move faster than the speed of light, thus travelling backwards in time.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;One final complication was that the theory could not properly work without
					assuming the existence of no fewer than 26 separate dimensions (instead of the
					usual four &ndash; three dimensions of space, plus time). The concept of extra
					dimensions had been around for a long time: German mathematician Theodor Kaluza
					had attempted to unify electromagnetism and gravity through the use of an extra
					(fifth) dimension. This was not a problem mathematically, but did pose the
					question as to why we do not experience all dimensions. In 1926, Swedish
					physicist Oscar Klein explained how such extra dimensions might remain invisible
					on everyday macroscopic scales by suggesting they might “roll up” into
					quantum-scale loops.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;String theory suffered a fall from grace in the mid-1970s. The theory of
					quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which introduced the concept of “colour charge”
					for quarks to explain their interaction via the strong nuclear force, offered a
					much better description. But even before this, some scientists had been
					murmuring that the theory was conceptually flawed. The more work they did, the
					more it seemed as though strings were not describing the strong force at

					found in the standard model of <a href="#calibre_link-20" class="calibre3">particle
						physics</a> has an undiscovered “superpartner” &ndash; a fermion to match

					which offered a solution to the problem of competing superstring theories. He
					added a single additional dimension, bringing the total up to 11, and this
					allowed all five superstring approaches to be described as aspects of a single
					theory. The 11 dimensions of space-time required by M-theory mirrored the 11
					dimensions required by then-popular models of “supergravity” (supersymmetric
					gravity). According to Witten’s theory, the seven additional dimensions of space
					required would be “compactified” &ndash; curled up into tiny structures analogous to
					spheres that would effectively act and appear as points on all but the most
					microscopic of scales.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The major problem of M-theory, however, is that the detail of the theory
					itself is currently unknown. Rather, it is a prediction of the existence of a
					theory with certain characteristics that would neatly fulfil a number of
					observed or predicted criteria.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its current limitations, M-theory has proved a huge inspiration to
					various fields of physics and cosmology. Black hole singularities can be
					interpreted as string phenomena, as can the early stages of the Big Bang. One
					intriguing upshot of M-theory is the “cyclic Universe” model proposed by
					cosmologists such as Neil Turok and Paul Steinhardt. In this theory, our
					Universe is just one of many separate branes separated from each other by minute
					distances in 11-dimensional space-time, and drifting minutely in relation to one
					another on trillion-year timescales. Collisions between branes, it has been
					argued, could result in huge releases of energy and trigger new Big
					Bangs.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-926" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Theories of everything</h2></div><p class="calibre12">M-theory has been proposed as a possible “Theory of Everything” &ndash; a means of
					uniting the quantum field theories that successfully describe electromagnetism
					and the weak and strong nuclear forces with the description of gravity provided
					by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Hitherto, a quantum description of
					gravitation has remained elusive. Gravity appears to be radically different in
					nature from the other three forces. These three forces all act between
					individual particles but only on relatively small scales, while gravity is
					insignificant except when huge numbers of particles conglomerate, but acts
					across enormous distances. One possible explanation of gravity’s unusual
					behaviour is that its influence at the quantum level may “leak out” into the
					higher dimensions, so that only a small fraction is perceived within the
					familiar dimensions of our Universe.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;String theory is not the only candidate for a Theory of Everything. Loop
					quantum gravity (LQG) was developed by Lee Smolin and Carlo Rovelli from the
					late 1980s. In this theory, the quantized properties of particles arise not from
					their string-like nature, but rather from the small-scale structure of
					space-time itself, which is quantized into tiny loops. LQG and its various
					developments offer several intriguing advantages over string theory, removing
					the need for additional dimensions, and it has been applied successfully to
					several major cosmological problems. However, the case for either string
					particles or looped space-time as the “Theory of Everything” remains
					inconclusive.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre16">"If string theory is a mistake, it’s not a trivial mistake. It’s a deep

				So-called “Hawking radiation” is emitted at the black hole’s event horizon &ndash; the
				outer boundary at which the black hole’s gravity becomes so strong that not even

				element of each pair to be pulled into the black hole, effectively boosting the
				survivor into a sustained existence as a real particle. The result of this to a

				one. He attributed his results to a transforming “chemical principle” that had
				leaked from the dead cells into the living ones. A quarter of a century before DNA’s

				(C) existed in only three forms, or allotropes: diamond, graphite, and amorphous
				carbon &ndash; the main constituent of soot and charcoal. That changed in 1985 with the
				work of British chemist Harry Kroto and his American colleagues Robert Curl and
				Richard Smalley. The chemists vaporized graphite with a laser beam to produce
				various carbon clusters, forming molecules with an even number of carbon atoms. The
				most abundant clusters had the formulae C60 and
					C70. These were molecules that had never been seen
				before.</p><p class="calibre15">C60 (or carbon-60) soon turned out to have remarkable
				properties. The chemists realized that it had a structure like a soccer ball &ndash; a
				complete spherical cage of carbon atoms, each bonded to three others in such a way
				that all the faces of the polyhedron are either pentagons or hexagons.
					C70 is more like a rugby ball; it has an extra ring of
				carbon atoms round its equator.</p><p class="calibre15">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both C70 and C60 reminded Kroto of
				the futuristic geodesic domes designed by American architect Buckminster Fuller, so
				he named the compounds buckminsterfullerene, but they are also called buckyballs, or
				fullerenes.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-951"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000220.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-952" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Properties of buckeyballs</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The team found that the C60 compound was stable and
					could be heated to high temperatures without decomposing. It turned into a gas
					at about 650°C (1,202°F). It was odourless, and was insoluble in water, but
					slightly soluble in organic solvents. The buckyball is also one of the largest
					objects ever found to exhibit the properties both of a particle and of a wave.
					In 1999, Austrian researchers sent molecules of C60
					through narrow slits and observed the interference pattern of wave-like
					behaviour.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Solid C60 is as soft as graphite, but when highly
					compressed, it changes into a super-hard form of diamond. The soccer ball, it
					seems, can withstand a lot of pressure.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure C60 is a semiconductor of electricity, meaning
					that its conductivity is between that of an insulator and a conductor. But when
					atoms of alkali metals such as sodium or potassium are added to it, it becomes a
					conductor, and even a superconductor at low temperatures, conducting electricity
					with no resistance at all.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;C60 also undergoes a wide variety of chemical
					reactions, resulting in huge numbers of products (chemical substances) whose
					properties are still being investigated.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-953" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The new world of nano</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Although C60 was the first of these molecules to be

					few nanometres wide, but up to several millimetres long. They are good
					conductors of heat and electricity, chemically inactive, and enormously strong,
					which makes them hugely useful for engineering.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many others that are being investigated for everything from
					electrical properties to medical treatments for cancer to HIV. The latest
					spin-off from the fullerenes is graphene, a flat sheet of carbon atoms, like a

				consists of about 20,000 genes. A gene is a living organism’s molecular unit of
				heredity. However, genes often malfunction. A defective gene is made when a normal
				gene is not copied properly, and the “error” is passed down from parents to
				offspring. The symptoms that arise from these so-called genetic diseases depend upon
				the gene involved. A gene works by controlling the production of a protein &ndash; one of
				many that perform a vast variety of functions in living organisms &ndash; but this
				production fails if there is an error. For example, if a blood-clotting gene
				malfunctions, the body stops producing the blood protein that makes blood clot &ndash;
				causing the disease haemophilia.</p><p class="calibre15">Genetic diseases cannot be cured by conventional drugs, and for a long time, it
				was only possible to alleviate the symptoms and make a sufferer’s life as
				comfortable as possible. But in the 1970s, scientists began considering the
				possibility of “gene therapy” to cure disease &ndash; using “healthy” genes to replace or
				override faulty ones.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-959"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000240.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-960" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Introducing new genes</h2></div><p class="calibre12">Genes can be introduced into diseased parts of the body by a vector &ndash; a
					particle that “carries” the gene to its source. Researchers investigated several
					possibilities for entities that might act as a vector &ndash; including viruses, which
					are more normally associated with causing disease, rather than fighting it.
					Viruses naturally invade living cells as part of their infection cycle, but
					could they perhaps carry the therapeutic genes with them?</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, a team of American scientists including William French Anderson
					succeeded in using viruses to insert genes into cultured (laboratory-grown)
					tissue. They tested it on animals that suffered from a genetic immune deficiency
					disease. The aim was to get the therapeutic gene into the animals’ bone marrow,
					which would then make healthy red blood cells and cure the deficiency. The test
					was not very effective, although the procedure worked better when white blood
					cells were targeted.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, however, Anderson performed the first clinical trial, treating two
					girls who both suffered from the same immune deficiency condition, known as
					bubble-boy disease. Sufferers of this condition are so susceptible to infection
					that they may have to spend their whole lives in a sterile environment, or
					“bubble”.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s team took sample cells from the two girls, treated them with the
					gene-carrying virus, then transfused the cells back into the girls. The
					treatment was repeated several times over two years &ndash; and it worked. However,
					its effects were only temporary, since new cells made by the body would still
					inherit the malfunctioning gene. This remains a central problem for gene therapy
					researchers today.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-961"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000415.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Scientists use viruses</span> as a vector to

					In 1989, scientists working in the USA identified the gene that causes cystic
					fibrosis. In this condition, defective cells produce sticky mucus that clogs
					lungs and the digestive system. Within five years of identifying the defective
					gene responsible, a technique had been developed to deliver healthy genes using
					liposomes &ndash; a type of oily droplet &ndash; as a vector. Results from the first
					clinical trial are due in 2014.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable challenges still remain to be overcome to extend gene therapy.
					Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defect in just one gene. However, many conditions
					with a genetic component &ndash; such as Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and diabetes &ndash;
					are caused by the interplay of many different genes. Such conditions are far
					harder to treat, and the search for successful, safe gene therapies is

				Venter created the first wholly artificial life form. The organism &ndash; a single-celled
				bacterium &ndash; was assembled from its raw chemical building blocks. This was a
				testament to the advance in our understanding of the nature of life itself. The
				dream of creating life is nothing new. In 1771, Luigi Galvani used electricity to
				make a dissected frog’s leg twitch, inspiring novelist Mary Shelley to write
					<i class="calibre11">Frankenstein</i>. But scientists gradually
				realized that life depends less on a physical “spark” and more on the chemical
				processes taking place inside cells.</p><p class="calibre15">By the mid-1950s, the real secret of life had been found in a molecule called
				deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which exists in the nucleus of every cell. The long
				string of DNA’s chemical building blocks was identified as the genetic code that
				controls the workings of the cell. Creating life would mean creating DNA &ndash; and
				getting the sequence of building blocks, called nucleotides, exactly right.
				Nucleotides each have one of just four kinds of bases, but combine in countless
				ways.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-965"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000162.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre16">"We are creating a new value system for life."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Craig Venter</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-966" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Making DNA</h2></div><p class="calibre12">The sequence of nucleotides differs in each organism, and is the result of

					scientists had to copy a sequence from a naturally existing organism. By 1990,
					new technology was available to work this out through a host of complex methods,
					and the international Human Genome Project was launched to sequence the entire
					human genetic makeup, or genome.</p><p class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first organism &ndash; a bacterium &ndash; was sequenced in 1995. Three years later,
					frustrated by the slow pace of the Human Genome Project, Venter left to set up
					the private company Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome more quickly
					and to release the data into the public domain. In 2007, his team announced that
					it had made an artificial chromosome &ndash; a complete string of DNA &ndash; based on that
