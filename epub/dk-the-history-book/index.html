In the words of
			20th-century historian R G Collingwood: “The value of history is that it teaches
			us what man has done and thus what man is.” We cannot hope to understand our
			lives without it.</p><p class="calibre11">History itself has a history. From earliest times, all societies &ndash; literate or
			pre-literate &ndash; told stories about their origins or their past, usually
			imaginative tales centring around the acts of gods and heroes. The first literate
			civilizations also kept records of the actions of their rulers, inscribed on clay
			tablets or on the walls of palaces and temples. But at first these ancient societies
			made no attempt at a systematic enquiry into the truth of the past; they did not
			differentiate between what had really happened and the events manifest in myth and
			legend.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-168"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">George Santayana <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The Life of Reason (1905)</i></span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h"></h2></div><div id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Ancient historical narrative</h2></div><p class="intro">It was the Ancient Greek writers Herodotus and Thucydides in the 5th century
					BCE who first explored questions about the past through the collection and
					interpretation of evidence &ndash; the word “history”, first used
					by Herodotus, means “enquiry” in Greek. Herodotus’s work
					still contained a considerable mixture of myth, but Thucydides’ account
					of the Peloponnesian War satisfies most criteria of modern historical study. It
					was based on interviews with eyewitnesses of the conflict and attributed events
					to human agency rather than the intervention and actions of the gods.</p><p class="calibre11">Thucydides had invented one of the most durable forms of history: the detailed
					narrative of war and political conflict, diplomacy and decision-making. The
					subsequent rise of Rome to dominance of the Mediterranean world encouraged
					historians to develop another genre of broader scope: the account of “how
					we got to where we are today”. The Hellenic historian Polybius
					(200&ndash;118 BCE) and the Roman historian Livy (59 BCE&ndash;17 CE) both
					sought to create a narrative of the rise of Rome &ndash; a “big
					picture” that would help to make sense of events on a large timescale.
					Although restricted to the Roman world, this was the beginning of what is
					sometimes called “universal history”, which attempts to describe
					progress from earliest origins to the present as a story with a goal, giving the
					past apparent purpose and direction.</p><p class="calibre11">At the same period in China, historian Sima Qian (c.145&ndash;86 BCE) was
					similarly tracing Chinese history over thousands of years, from the legendary
					Yellow Emperor (c.2697 BCE) to the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu (c.109
					BCE).</p></div><div id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Moral lessons</h2></div><p class="intro">As well as making sense of events through narratives, historians in the
					ancient world established the tradition of history as a source of moral lessons
					and reflections. The history writing of Livy or Tacitus (56&ndash;117 CE), for
					instance, was in part designed to examine the behaviour of heroes and villains,
					meditating on the strengths and weaknesses in the characters of emperors and
					generals, providing exemplars for the virtuous to imitate or shun. This
					continues to be one of the functions of history. French chronicler Jean
					Froissart (1337&ndash;1405) said he had written his accounts of chivalrous
					knights fighting in the Hundred Years’ War “so that brave men

					concept of history in Europe. Historical events came to be viewed by Christians
					as divine providence, or the working out of God’s will. Sceptical enquiry
					into what actually happened was usually neglected, and accounts of miracles and
					martyrdoms were generally accepted as true without question. The Muslim world,
					in this as in other ways, was frequently more sophisticated than Christendom in
					Medieval times, with the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun (1332&ndash;1406) railing
					against the blind, uncritical acceptance of fanciful accounts of events that
					could not be verified.</p><p class="calibre11">Neither Christian nor Muslim historians produced a work on the scale of the

					The Renaissance &ndash; which began in Italy in the 15th century, then spread
					throughout Europe, lasting until the end of the 16th century in some areas
					&ndash; centred upon the rediscovery of the past. Renaissance thinkers found a
					fertile source of inspiration in classical antiquity, in areas as diverse as
					architecture, philosophy, politics, and military tactics. The humanist scholars
					of the Renaissance period declared history one of the principal subjects in
					their new educational curriculum, and the antiquary became a familiar figure in
					elite circles, rummaging among ancient ruins and building up collections of old
					coins and inscriptions. At the same time, the spread of printing made history
					available to a much wider audience than ever before.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-174"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"To live with men of an earlier age is like travelling in foreign

					&ndash; had reached a fair level of sophistication. European thinkers had
					reached general agreement on the division of the past into three main periods:
					Ancient, Medieval, and Modern. This periodization was at root a value judgment,
					with the Medieval period, dominated by the Church, viewed as a time of
					irrationality and barbarism and separating the dignified world of the ancient
					civilizations from the newly emerging, rational universe of modern Europe.

					and the present. The Romantics drew inspiration from the Middle Ages, and
					instead of seeing the past as a preparation for the modern world, as had
					previously been the case, Romantic historians tried the imaginative exercise of
					entering into the spirit of past ages. Much of this was associated with
					nationalism. The German Romantic thinker Johann Gottfried Herder
					(1774&ndash;1803) burrowed into the past in search of roots of national
					identity and an authentic “German spirit”. As nationalism
					triumphed in Europe in the 19th century, much of history became a celebration of
					national characteristics and national heroes, often veering into myth-making.
					Every country wanted to have its sacred heroic history, just as it had its flag
					and its national anthem.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-177"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000249.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The “Grand Narrative”</h2></div><p class="intro">In the 19th century, history became increasingly important and took on the
					quality of destiny. Arrogantly, European civilization saw itself as the goal to
					which all history had been progressing and constructed narratives that made
					sense of the past in those terms. The German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
					Hegel (1770&ndash;1831) articulated a grand scheme of history as a logical
					development, which culminated in the end point of the Prussian state.
					Philosopher and social revolutionary Karl Marx (1818&ndash;83) later adapted
					Hegel’s scheme into his own theory (“historical
					materialism”), in which he claimed that economic progress, which caused
					conflict between the social classes, would inevitably one day result in the
					proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie, while the capitalist world order
					collapsed under its own inner contradictions. Arguably, Marxism was to prove the
					most influential and durable of all historical “grand
					narratives”.</p><p class="calibre11">Like other areas of knowledge, in the 19th century history underwent
					professionalization and it became an academic discipline. Academic history
					aspired to the status of a science, and the accumulation of
					“facts” was its avowed purpose. A gap opened up between
					“serious” history &ndash; often heavy on economic statistics
					&ndash; and the colourful literary works of popular historians, such as Jules
					Michelet (1798&ndash;1874) and Thomas Macaulay (1800&ndash;59).</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-179"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"History is little more than the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of

					(initially those in France) chose to disregard the “history of

					history was written as the story of the triumph of Western civilization. This
					approach was as implicit in Marxist versions of history as in those histories
					that celebrated the progress of technology, enterprise, and liberal democracy.
					It did not necessarily imply optimism &ndash; there were numerous prophets of
					decline and doom. But it did suggest that essentially history had been made, and
					was still being made, by Europe and European offshoots further afield. For
					instance, it was deemed acceptable for respected European historians to maintain
					that black Africa had no significant history at all, having failed to contribute

					purposeful, historical “grand narrative” collapsed, taking
					Eurocentrism with it. The post-colonial, post-modernist world was seen as
					requiring a multiplicity of histories told from the point of view of many
					different social identities. There was a surge of interest in the study of black
					history, women’s history, and gay history, as well as histories narrated
					from an Asian, African, or a Native American standpoint. The marginal and
					oppressed in society were reassessed as “agents” of history rather
					than passive victims.</p><p class="calibre11">A riot of revisionism upturned much of the history of the world as commonly
					known to educated people in the West, although often without putting any
					satisfactory alternative version in place of the old. For example, the
					puzzlement that resulted can be seen in the response to the 500th anniversary in
					1992 of Christopher Columbus’s first voyage to the Americas. It would
					once have been expected to excite widespread celebration in the United States,

				Africa. By the usual processes of biological evolution and natural selection, the
				genus <i class="calibre5">Homo</i> evolved in East Africa over millions
				of years alongside the chimpanzees, its near relatives. By the same biological
				processes, <i class="calibre5">Homo sapiens</i> &ndash; modern humans
				&ndash; evolved alongside other hominins (the relatives of humans, including
				Neanderthals, who died out 40,000 years ago).</p><p class="calibre14">About 100,000 years ago or so, the scattered bands of hunting and foraging humans
				would have been almost indistinguishable from the other great apes. But at some
				point (precisely when is hard to define) humans began to change in a new way, not by
				the process of biological evolution but by cultural evolution. They developed the
				ability to alter their way of life through the creation of tools, languages,
				beliefs, social customs, and art. By the time they were painting exquisite pictures
				of animals on the walls of caves and carving or sculpting figurines out of stone or
				bone, they had marked themselves out uniquely from other animals. Their
				transformation was slow in the early years, but it was set to gather incredible
				momentum over millennia. Humans had become the only animals with a history.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-187"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000172.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Discovering history</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The early development of human cultures and societies presents a particular
					problem to historians. The first writing was not invented until quite late in
					the human story &ndash; about 5,000 years ago. Traditionally, the period before
					writing tended to be dismissed as “pre-history”, since it left no
					documents for historians to study. However, in recent years a wide range of new
					scientific methods &ndash; including the study of genetic material and
					radiocarbon dating of organic remains &ndash; have been added to the
					long-established techniques of archaeology, enabling scholars to shine at least
					a flickering light upon the pre-literate era.</p><p class="calibre14">The narrative of the distant human past is under constant revision as new
					discoveries and research &ndash; its findings frequently disputed &ndash;
					create radical shifts in perspective. The fresh investigation of a single cave,
					a burial site, or a human skull can still throw large areas of accepted
					knowledge into question. However, in the 21st century much of the history of
					early humans can be described with a reasonable degree of confidence.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Nomadic hunter-gatherers</h2></div><p class="calibre15">All historians agree that until about 12,000 years ago humans were
					hunter-gatherers, using stone tools and living in small, mobile groups. This
					period is referred to as the Paleolithic Era (or Old Stone Age). Humans were a
					successful species, expanding their numbers to perhaps 10 million and spreading
					to most parts of the Earth. Generally, they adapted well to the major natural
					climate changes that occurred over tens of thousands of years, although they
					were temporarily driven out of northerly areas, such as Britain and Scandinavia,
					during the coldest phase of what is popularly known as the Ice Age.</p><p class="calibre14">Humans existed in an intimate relationship with their natural environment, but
					their effect on that environment even at this early stage was not necessarily
					benign. There is a disturbing coincidence between the spread of human hunters
					across the planet and the extinction of megafauna such as woolly mammoths and
					mastodons. Although human hunting is far from being identified as the sole cause
					of these extinctions &ndash; natural climate change may well have been a
					contributing factor &ndash; from our modern perspective they can seem to set a
					troubling precedent.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The farming revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which can reasonably be described as
					“natural” to human beings, appears to have had much to recommend
					it. Examination of human remains from early hunter-gatherer societies has
					suggested that our ancestors usually enjoyed abundant food, obtainable without
					excessive effort, and suffered very few diseases. If this is true, it is not
					clear what then motivated so many human beings all over the world to settle in
					permanent villages and develop agriculture, growing crops and domesticating
					animals: cultivating fields was grindingly hard work, and it was in farming
					villages that epidemic diseases first took root.</p><p class="calibre14">Whatever its immediate effect on the quality of life for humans, the
					development of settlements and agriculture indisputably led to a high increase
					in population density. Sometimes known as the Neolithic Revolution (or New Stone
					Age), this period was a major turning point in human development, opening the
					way to the growth of the first towns and cities, and eventually leading to
					settled “civilizations”.</p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

					Palaeolithic people. Even today, many societies still living mainly by hunting
					and gathering share animistic beliefs, meaning they believe entities such as
					animals, plants, and parts of the landscape have spirits with which humans
					interact during their daily life. Many such societies’ religious
					specialists, or shamans, believe they are able to communicate with these spirits
					to help sick or injured people, and historically, rock art has been created by
					shamans during states of altered consciousness, or trances, as part of this
					communication, leading some researchers to suggest that Palaeolithic societies
					may have had similar beliefs. Shamans are also often thought to be able to
					transform themselves into animals to encourage them to give themselves up to the
					hunter, which could also explain depictions combining human and animal
					characteristics, such as the Lion Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel, in Germany, or the
					Sorcerer of Les Trois Frères Cave in France, a human-like figure with
					antlers.</p><p class="calibre14">Creating images of animals may have also been part of “magic”

					this time comes from burials. At the site of Dolní Věstonice, in
					the Czech Republic, for example, three bodies were buried together in a sexually
					suggestive pose, with one of the male individuals flanking a female skeleton
					reaching towards her pelvis, and the male on the other side buried face down. A
					red pigment known as ochre had been sprinkled across their heads and across the
					female’s pelvis. Interestingly, all three individuals share the same rare
					skeletal deformities and may therefore have been related. Although the reasons
					why these bodies were arranged this way will probably always be a mystery, it is
					clear that there was more to this burial than just the functional disposal of
					remains.</p><p class="calibre14">At other sites, some individuals were buried with many “grave
					goods” &ndash; for example, the complex jewellery made from dentalium
					shells at Arene Candide, in Italy, and the striking spears fashioned from
					mammoth ivory at the burial site of two young children in Sunghir, in Russia.
					Some researchers have suggested that these richly adorned individuals &ndash;
					especially the young ones, who would not have had time in their short life to
					establish a reputation that might account for special treatment in death
					&ndash; imply that hierarchies and status distinctions were beginning to
					develop in some groups. However, they do not appear to have become widespread
					until much later. It is clear, however, that for the first time, people were now
					increasingly concerned with what happened after death, and about how the dead
					should enter into the afterlife.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-208"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"People everywhere and throughout time have shared the basic instinct to

				relationship that exists between humans and our environments has affected the
				development of our societies. Humans evolved during the last Ice Age, living through
				periodic shifts between very cold climatic conditions (glacials) and warmer periods
				more like those of today (interglacials). However, towards the end of the Ice Age,
				these shifts became more pronounced and occurred at shorter intervals, culminating
				around 21000 BCE in a “Big Freeze”, a period of intense cold known as
				the Last Glacial Maximum. People and animals living in northern regions died out or
				retreated south as ice caps expanded to reach southern England. Such huge amounts of
				sea water froze that sea levels dropped, exposing low-lying land such as Beringia,
				the continental shelf that connects North America and Asia &ndash; and the route by
				which humans first reached the Americas.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-220"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000281.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Rising temperatures</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Temperatures eventually rose again, and today’s relatively warm and
					stable climate had become established by around 7000 BCE. The ice caps melted,
					and rising sea levels separated Eurasia from the Americas, turned Southeast Asia
					into an archipelago, and made islands out of peninsulas such as Japan and
					Britain, thereby isolating many human groups. The impact on ecosystems was
					particularly severe for the large animals known as megafauna &ndash; mammoths,
					for example. The open glacial steppe grasslands in which megafauna thrived were
					replaced by expanding forests, and across the globe the combination of
					environmental change and human hunting drove many species to extinction.</p><p class="calibre14">The forests and wetlands of the new post-glacial world offered humans many new
					opportunities. They hunted large forest animals such as red deer and wild boar,
					as well as smaller mammals like rabbits, and they foraged for a range of aquatic
					and coastal food sources. Migratory fish like salmon, sea mammals such as seals,
					and shellfish, seasonal wildfowl, and a range of fruits, tubers, nuts, and seeds

					in the Near East. Some groups began to manipulate their environments, burning
					vegetation and cutting down trees to encourage their preferred plant and animal
					species to thrive. They started to select and care for productive plant species
					and sowed the seeds of favoured strains, while managing and controlling certain
					animals. This manipulation led to these species becoming ever more reliant on

				the most famous archaeological sites in the world due to its size, density of
				settlement, spectacular wall paintings, and evidence of complex religious and ritual
				behaviour. Since its discovery, several other large settlements across the Near East
				have been found that attest to the growing scale of human communities during the
				shift from foraging to agricultural lifestyles, or “Neolithic
				revolution”, that occurred between around 10000 BCE and 7000 BCE. Whether
				rising populations forced people to find more stable means of subsistence or farming
				allowed people to have more children, the sizes of many settlements increased
				substantially and became more permanent. New ways had to be found to resolve social
				stresses such as disputes between neighbours.</p><p class="calibre14">Early villagers invested time and effort in planting and cultivating crops, then

					group ritual practices may have helped community cohesion. At many sites,
					buildings were set aside for such purposes; these were larger than domestic
					structures, with unusual features such as lime plaster benches and more evidence
					of symbolic and representational art: Çatalhöyük boasts
					murals and figurines of a range of subjects including wild animals such as
					bulls, leopards, and vultures. At many sites, some inhabitants remained in the
					community even when they died; they were buried under the floors of the houses.
					Sometimes they were later dug up and their skulls removed; facial features were
					moulded on some in plaster and painted with ochre for display. At sites like Ain
					Ghazal in Jordan, large statues made of lime plaster have been found, and there
					are many examples of clay figurines of animals and (mainly female) humans. It is
					not clear whether these decorated skulls, statues, and figurines represent
					specific individuals or heads of households or lineages, or perhaps mythical
					ancestors or gods, but they may have been part of the communal ideologies,
					rituals, and social practices that helped smooth over tensions between
					individuals and broader regional groups, who were establishing more formal links
					with one another for long-distance trade and exchange of goods. Some of the
					success of Çatalhöyük may have been due to its role as a
					centre for the large-scale trade of items made from the obsidian, or volcanic

					quarters with animals meant that some animal diseases spread to humans &ndash;
					for example, smallpox, anthrax, tuberculosis, and the flu. Larger communities
					living at higher densities allowed for such diseases to be more easily passed
					around. It also caused problems in disposing of human and animal waste and thus

				unprecedented complexity. These “civilizations” typically had state
				structures and social hierarchies, they built cities and monuments such as temples,
				palaces, and pyramids, and used some form of writing. The basis for the development
				of civilizations was progress in agriculture. When only part of the population was
				required to work in the fields to produce food, the rest could inhabit towns and
				palaces, performing a range of specialist functions as bureaucrats, traders,
				scribes, and priests. The invention of civilization undoubtedly raised human life to
				a new level in many ways &ndash; in technology, the arts, astronomy, the
				measurement of time, literature, and philosophy &ndash; but also established
				inequality and exploitation as the basis of society, leading to larger-scale warfare
				as states expanded into empires.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-233"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000128.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Emerging civilizations</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The earliest civilizations developed in areas where it was possible to
					practise intensive agriculture, usually involving use of irrigation systems
					&ndash; for instance, along the rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates in
					Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in northern India and
					Pakistan, and the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in China. Although these
					civilizations of Eurasia and North Africa seem to have been founded
					independently of one another, they developed multiple contacts over time,
					sharing ideas, technology, and even diseases. All followed a pattern in which
					stone tools (the Stone Age) were replaced by bronze (the Bronze Age) and then
					predominantly iron (the Iron Age). In the Americas, where the Olmec and Maya
					developed the civilizations of Mesoamerica, the use of stone tools persisted and
					most of the epidemic diseases that plagued Eurasia were unknown.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-235" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Writing and philosophy</h2></div><p class="calibre15">From around 1000 BCE, Eurasian civilizations found an innovative momentum. The
					use of writing evolved from practical record-keeping to the creation of sacred
					books and classic literary texts that embodied the founding myths and beliefs of
					different societies, from the Homeric tales in Greece to the Five Classics of
					Confucianism in China and the Hindu Vedas in India. Forms of writing using an
					alphabet developed in the eastern Mediterranean region and were spread by the
					Phoenicians &ndash; a race of traders and sailors.</p><p class="calibre14">The Greek city-states became a test-bed for new forms of political
					organization, including democracy, and the source of new ideas in the arts and
					philosophy. The influence of Greek culture spread as far as northern India,
					while India itself was the birthplace of Buddhism &ndash; the first
					“world religion”, winning converts beyond its society of
					origin.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Growing populations</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The ancient world reached the peak of its classical period around 2,000 years
					ago. The world’s population had grown from around 20 million at the time
					of the first civilizations to an estimated 200 million. About 50 million of
					these lived in a united Han China, while about the same number were under the
					governance of the Roman Empire, which had extended its rule to the shores of the
					Atlantic and the borders of Persia. In large part, the empires were successful
					because of efficient communications by land and water, and the ruthless
					deployment of military power. Long-distance trade routes linked Europe to India
					and China, and cities had expanded to a great degree &ndash; Rome’s
					population was estimated at over 1 million.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Civilizations in decline</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The causes of the decline of these powerful classical empires from the 3rd
					century CE have long been disputed among historians. Bred in overcrowded cities
					and transmitted along trade routes, epidemic diseases certainly played a part.
					Internal power struggles were also a major factor, leading to political
					fragmentation and a decline in the quality of government. But perhaps most
					crucial was the geographical limitation of the civilized areas of Eurasia. Both
					the Roman and Han empires built walls to mark and defend the borders of their
					empires, beyond which lived mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic
					“barbarian” tribes. The civilized societies had little or no
					military advantage over these peoples, who increasingly raided or settled within
					their territories. The eastern part of the Christianized Roman Empire survived
					until 1453, and Chinese civilization revived to full vigour under the Tang

					Euphrates and the Tigris, and it is considered to be the first human
					civilization ever. Its writing, maths, and astronomy were also the first known,
					and its cities arguably the world’s first true examples. Growth of its
					population and wealth led to the emergence of a hierarchy in society, led by
					rulers, courtiers, and priests at the top, through merchants and artisans, to
					servants and labourers at the bottom. This is often referred to as
					“specialization”: members of society having different tasks,
					rather than all producing food as had been the case in previous subsistence
					societies.</p><p class="calibre14">Mesopotamian communities coordinated manpower to build large structures such
					as defensive walls and huge temples, and to mobilize armies. They utilized
					hydrological engineering to divert river water and irrigate the alluvial
					floodplains. Administrative needs such as bookkeeping led to the development of
					cuneiform writing, the first known script, and of complex mathematical concepts
					such as fractions, equations, and geometry. Sophisticated astronomy developed
					for calendric purposes. Sometimes called the Bronze Age Revolution, this great
					step forward can be seen as the most important change in the human world before

					competing kingdoms and city-states such as Uruk, Isin, Lagash, Ur, Nippur, and
					Larsa. Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon, unified the region through a
					combination of guile, diplomacy, opportunism, military might, and longevity. As
					was traditional with conquering kings, Hammurabi used previous edicts as the
					basis for his laws, but these laws were distinguished by the reach of his
					empire, and by the fact that they were inscribed on stelae (stone slabs), and so
					recorded in perpetuity.</p><p class="calibre14">Hammurabi’s laws and their detailed prelude reveal much about life in

					soon after his death, his reign was a turning point for southern Mesopotamia. He
					firmly established the ideal of a unified state, centred in Babylon, and his
					laws were copied by Mesopotamian scribes until at least the 6th century BCE.
					They show many points of similarity with, and may have influenced, laws of the

					dynasties in many of the city-states. By the early 18th century BCE, the three
					most powerful Amorite kings were pre-eminent Shamshi-Adad in the north, Rim-Sin
					in Larsa in the south, and Hammurabi in Babylon in the centre. Over the course
					of his long reign, Hammurabi consolidated all of southern Mesopotamia into his
					kingdom and eventually extended his power as far up the Tigris as Nineveh, and
					as far up the Euphrates as Tuttul, on the junction with the river Balikh. He
					personally supervised the construction of many temples and other
					buildings.</p><p class="calibre11">The prelude to his code, a tribute to Hammurabi and a long historical record

					Herodotus) first unified the kingdoms of the Upper (southern) and Lower
					(northern) Nile. Narmer’s deeds were recorded on a stone palette, which
					was recovered from a temple at Hierakonpolis in the 19th century and provides
					one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. The palette is
					inscribed with many of the symbols and traditions that would come to typify the
					pharaohs for the next three millennia. For instance, Narmer is shown holding an
					enemy by the hair, about to smite him, and Ramesses II was often depicted in the

					Egyptian kingship. The pharaoh, like the gods, was frequently shown much larger

					the fertile Nile Valley and its delta, which empties in the north into the
					Mediterranean sea, and the surrounding expanses of uninhabitable desert &ndash;
					gave rise to the kingdom’s unique culture and civilization. The pharaoh
					was viewed as a living god who could control the order of the cosmos, including
					the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertilizing silt to replenish the
					soil. Pharaohs were also often depicted as farmers in agricultural scenes,

					technological, and economic development, increasing trade with other kingdoms in
					the Near East and the Mediterranean. In the Old Kingdom the predominant gods
					were Ra, the sun god; Osiris, the god of the dead; and Ptah, the creator. In the
					Middle and New Kingdoms that followed, which were ruled by families from Thebes,
					Amon became the main deity. As supreme ruler, the pharaoh was closely associated

					(probably Semites from Syria). The Hyksos, in turn, were expelled from Egypt in
					about 1550 BCE, with the XVIII dynasty &ndash; arguably the greatest and most
					important &ndash; coming to power and establishing the New Kingdom. By this
					time, immortality was believed to be available not just to the pharaoh, but to
					priests, scribes, and others who could afford offerings, spells, and
					mummification, and many tombs were dug into the Valley of the Kings to be filled
					with extraordinarily rich grave goods.</p><p class="calibre14">Under expansionist pharaohs, such as Thutmose III and Ramesses II, Egyptian

				Kshatriyas ranked highest, and it was into this latter group that Siddartha Gautama
				was born.</p><p class="calibre14">India was then a ferment of sects and new ideologies, some of which espoused a
				philosophy renouncing the material world. Siddartha developed a similar philosophy
				based on mystical Hinduism, but he also rejected the increasingly rigid strictures
				of Vedic ritual and the inherited piety of the Brahmins. Renouncing material
				possessions, he sought and eventually found enlightenment, and became the Buddha. He
				preached in northeast India and founded the Sangha &ndash; the monastic order of
				Buddhism &ndash; to continue his ministry.</p><p class="calibre14">For the next two to three centuries, Buddhism remained one among several minor
				sects but, under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great (304&ndash;232 BCE), it
				became India’s state religion. Ashoka’s reign had proceeded initially
				through bloody conquest, but in around 261 BCE he had a change of heart. From then
				he embraced a new model of kingship and religious philosophy based on a creed of
				tolerance and non-violence. He extended Mauryan control and, his Buddhism proving a
				powerful unifying force, succeeded in joining all of India, except the southern tip,
				into an empire of 30 million people.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-257"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000295.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A world religion</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Having established Buddhism as the state religion, Ashoka founded monasteries,

					take root at all levels of society in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, along the Silk
					Road in the Indo&ndash;Greek kingdoms (in modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan),

					settled on Crete in the Neolithic era, in about 7000 BCE. They farmed crops,
					herded sheep, and worshipped in caves, on top of mountains, and at springs, but
					by 2400 BCE they had begun to build large palace complexes. By 1900 BCE, in what
					is known as the Palatial Period of the Minoan civilization, palaces at Knossos,
					Phaistos, Malia, and Chania had been constructed in broadly similar forms, with
					the one at Knossos being the largest. It was destroyed, possibly by fire or
					perhaps a tsunami, around 1700 BCE, but it was rebuilt soon after on the same
					site. At its peak, in about 1500 BCE, Knossos palace and the city that grew up
					around it covered 75 hectares (185 acres) and had a population of up to
					12,000.</p><p class="calibre14">The Minoan palaces all had large central courts, flanked by many-chambered
					buildings, and were highly decorated with frescoes of flora and fauna. In the
					extensive magazines (storehouses), the rulers &ndash; who may have served dual
					roles as priest-kings or priest-queens &ndash; gathered many commodities for
					redistribution. Minoan rulers also controlled trade with other Bronze Age
					civilizations around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos in Phoenicia (now

					in Linear A script remains undeciphered to this day, but in around 1450 BCE the
					Minoans were invaded by the Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, who adapted the
					Minoan script into Linear B, which was used to write archaic Greek.</p><p class="calibre14">Not long after the Mycenaeans invaded Crete, Minoan civilization collapsed

					the disc one of the great archaeological mysteries. The symbols, many of which

				them” was Leonidas’s laconic reply.</p><p class="calibre14">The Persian Wars (490&ndash;449 BCE), also known as the Graeco&ndash;Persian
				Wars, pitted a vast and cosmopolitan empire against a small band of city-states in
				the south of Greece. The conflict profoundly influenced the development of Classical
				Greek identity and culture, leaving a vivid trail in Western literature and myth. By
				contrast, the story of the Persian Achaemenid Empire remains comparatively

				civilization.</p><div id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Achaemenids</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The first Persian Empire, ruled by the dynasty known as the Achaemenids, grew
					rapidly. At its height it may have ruled over half the world’s
					population. It began in around 550 BCE, when the Persian king Cyrus the Great
					overthrew the ruling Medes, going on to conquer Babylonia, and Lydia (now in
					Turkey), which brought the Ionian Greeks under Persian rule. Cyrus’s
					successors Cambyses II and Darius extended the empire into Egypt and the
					Balkans, where Thrace and Macedon gave the Persians a foothold in Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">The Achaemenids established Persian rule as a model for later empires. Despite
					its vast size, the state embraced a degree of multi-culturalism, allowing
					conquered peoples liberty of religion, language, and culture. There was
					investment in infrastructure &ndash; like the Romans, the Persians built a
					network of roads to hold their empire together &ndash; and the military, and
					devolution of administration to local provinces. Under the Achaemenids, the
					Middle East was united under a single umbrella culture for the first
					time.</p><p class="calibre14">Conflict with the independent Greeks arose after the city-states of Athens and
					Eretrea supported an unsuccessful revolt by the Ionians against Persian rule in
					499. Darius responded by invading mainland Greece, but was defeated by the
					Athenians and their allies at Marathon in 490. He planned an even larger
					invasion, but it was only after his death that his son Xerxes began mustering a
					huge army to execute the plan.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-273"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000344.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">A hoplite</span> &ndash; or Greek

					historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus, known as both the Father of History and
					the Father of Lies. Herodotus estimated that Xerxes’ land army was made
					up of 1,700,000 men &ndash; but modern historians believe the maximum figure to
					be closer to 200,000.</p><p class="calibre14">The second Persian invasion, in 480, was held up by the heroic defence of
					Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, and by Greek naval resistance at
					Artemisium. Later the Athenian navy lured the Persian fleet into a trap at
					Salamis. Xerxes returned to Persia, leaving a large force to carry on the fight,
					but at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BCE the Greeks, led by the Spartans, crushed
					the Persians, who also lost to the Spartans at Mycale. Greek success can
					probably be ascribed to Xerxes’ difficulties in keeping his vast army
					supplied and supported after naval defeat, although Herodotus ascribed it to the
					moral superiority of their cause.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-275"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"All other expeditions... are as nothing compared with this. For was there

					military confidence, most significantly in Athens. The country’s rising
					power sparked conflict with Sparta, leading to the Peloponnesian War of

					<i class="calibre5">demos</i> (people) and <i class="calibre5">kratos</i> (rule). The democracy that developed in ancient Athens around
				507 BCE and flourished in its purest form from 462 to 322 BCE, albeit with some
				interruptions, provided the model for what has become the dominant form of
				government in the world: by 2015, 125 of the world’s 195 countries were
				electoral democracies. The democracy of ancient Athens, however, differed from its
				modern form, reflecting the history of Athens and the warring Greek states of the
				age.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-281"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000241.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Oligarchs and hoplites</h2></div><p class="calibre15">After the chaos of the ancient Greek Dark Ages &ndash; a period that followed
					the breakdown of Mycenaean civilization around 1100 BCE and lasted until about
					the 9th century BCE &ndash; most of the emergent city-states evolved into
					oligarchies, with powerful nobles monopolizing government and serving their own
					interests. In Athens, the Areopagus &ndash; a council and law court consisting
					of men of aristocratic birth &ndash; controlled the machinery of state,
					appointing officials and serving as a civil court, while the lower classes
						(<i class="calibre5">thetes</i>) were excluded from
					office.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the development of the “hoplite” model of
					citizen-soldiery in the 8th to 7th centuries BCE proved disruptive to those who
					were in power, as it led to a certain level of egalitarianism. Hoplites were men
					in the heavy infantry, mainly free citizens, whose primary tactic was the
					phalanx &ndash; a military formation in which soldiers stood in tightly packed
					ranks, with each man’s shield protecting the hoplite to his left. Any man
					who could afford the arms and armour would be putting his life on the line to
					defend the state. As a result, a kind of middle class emerged, which declared
					that service should bring full citizenship and political representation. At the
					same time, the lower classes were also making demands, and tensions between them
					and the higher orders over key issues, such as land reform and debt slavery,
					threatened to lead to civil breakdown.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-283"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"To the Athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as

					the statesman Solon. He established a law that declared all citizens could vote
					in matters of state, and that a law court should admit all citizens. At the same
					time, however, he mollified the upper classes by introducing a graded oligarchy
					in which power corresponded to wealth &ndash; the aristocracy were to control
					the highest offices, the middle class the lesser offices, and the poor could be
					selected by lot to serve on juries.</p><p class="calibre14">In the late 6th century BCE, Athens fell under the sway of the tyrant
					Pisistratus and his sons. In response, a faction of aristocrats led by
					Cleisthenes allied with lower-ranking members of society to take power. The
					institution of true democracy in Athens is traditionally dated to this point
					&ndash; around 507 BCE. Cleisthenes introduced true popular government, or
					direct democracy, enabling all citizens of Athens to vote directly on Athenian
					policy (unlike in a contemporary representative democracy, in which the people
					elect representatives to act as the legislature). He also reorganized the
					citizenry into units by geography rather than kinship, breaking the traditional
					ties that underpinned Athenian aristocratic society, and established sortition
					&ndash; the random selection of citizens for government positions rather than
					basing the choice on heredity. In addition, he restructured the Boule &ndash; a
					council of 500, which drew up legislation and proposed laws to the assembly of
					voters (<i class="calibre5">Ecclesia</i>). In 501 BCE, command of the
					military was transferred to popularly elected generals (<i class="calibre5">strategoi</i>).</p><p class="calibre14">In 462 BCE, Ephialtes became leader of the democratic movement in Athens and,
					together with his deputy Pericles, he dismantled the Areopagus council,
					transferring the majority of its powers to the Boule, the Ecclesia, and the
					citizen courts. Ephialtes was assassinated in 461 BCE and Pericles took over the
					political leadership, becoming one of the most influential rulers in the history
					of ancient Greece.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-285"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000268.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Parthenon</span>, built in 447&ndash;438

					participate in the system as they were not considered true citizens. Political
					rights were restricted to adult male Athenians; women, foreigners, and slaves
					were excluded. In the 4th century BCE, out of the 300,000-strong total
					population of Attica &ndash; the region of Greece controlled by Athens &ndash;
					just 30,000 men comprised the voting population. In theory, men became voting
					citizens at age 18, but as they were generally liable for two years of military
					service they were not enrolled on the rosters of the council until they turned
					20, and did not come into their full political rights until the age of
					30.</p><p class="calibre14">During the “Pentekontaetia” &ndash; the decades between Greek
					victory in the Persian War (479 BCE) and the start of the Peloponnesian War (431
					BCE) &ndash; Athens reached the height of its glory. In 447 BCE, Pericles
					appropriated the treasury of the Delian League (the anti-Persian confederation
					that had become a vessel for Athenian hegemony) to build a magnificent temple
					(the Parthenon) on the rocky hill known as the Acropolis. Citizenship of Athens
					was highly coveted, and in 451 BCE Pericles passed a law restricting it to men
					whose parents were both Athenians.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-287"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are

					also the crucible of a revolutionary new direction in philosophy, in large part
					due to Socrates (c.469&ndash;399 BCE). Earlier Greek philosophers, collectively
					known as the pre-Socratics, had introduced a revolution of their own in human
					thought in the 5th and 6th centuries BCE. They rejected supernatural
					explanations for the world, the explanatory power of mythology, and the
					authority of tradition, and set out to discover the origins and workings of the
					natural world through reason and observation. The pre-Socratic natural
					philosophers developed theories about the elements, classifications of nature,
					and mathematical and geometric proofs.</p><p class="calibre14">Socrates turned his enquiries inwards to more human matters &ndash; as Cicero
					said of him, “he brought philosophy down from heaven”.
					Socrates’ method was simply to ask questions &ndash; What is friendship?
					What is justice? What is knowledge? The Socratic method tended to lay bare the
					limits of existing thinking, often making people look foolish or pompous.
					Accordingly, Socrates was unpopular and eventually he was accused of two crimes
					by his enemies &ndash; corrupting youth by encouraging them to go against the
					government, and impiety, or lack of respect for the gods. Consequently, he was
					sentenced to death.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-289"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000216.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Athenian constitution</span> relied on a

					successors, particularly Plato (c.428&ndash;348 BCE), who saw him as a martyr
					for truth. Plato ran a school (the Academy) and developed ideas about universal
					truths and metaphysics that have shaped all subsequent religion and philosophy
					in the Western world. His student Aristotle (384&ndash;322 BCE) became equally
					influential, setting up the Lyceum school and writing on such diverse topics as
					politics, ethics, law, and natural sciences.</p><p class="calibre14">Plato opposed democracy, as he believed that the people were not sufficiently
					equipped with philosophical grace to legislate and if governance were left in
					the hands of the ordinary citizen tyranny would emerge. In his ideal republic,
					enlightened philosophers would rule as kings. He also challenged the basic
					principle of democracy &ndash; that of liberty (<i class="calibre5">eleutheria</i>) &ndash; which he believed could divert people from
					the proper pursuit of ethics and cause social disunity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-291"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000192.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><em class="calibre19"><strong class="calibre25">An Audience in Athens</strong></em> (1884), by

					ultimately defeated by the Spartans, Athenian democracy was twice suspended, in
					411 and 404 BCE. Athenian oligarchs claimed that Athens’ weak position
					was due to democracy and led a counter-revolution to replace democratic rule
					with an extreme oligarchy. In both cases, democratic rule was restored within
					one year.</p><p class="calibre14">Democracy flourished for the next eight decades. However, after the Macedonian
					conquest of Athens under Philip II and his son Alexander (later Alexander the
					Great) in 322 BCE, Athenian democracy was abolished. It was intermittently
					restored in the Hellenistic age in the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE, but the Roman
					conquest of Greece in 146 BCE effectively killed it off.</p><p class="calibre14">Although democratic rule had been quashed, Athenian science and philosophy
					lived on. The renown and influence of Plato and Aristotle endured through the
					ages that followed, and much of their work continues to influence Western
					thought to this day.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-293"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated

					around 462 BCE, when he helped the politician Ephialtes dismantle the Areopagus
					&ndash; the last bastion of oligarchic control. After Ephialtes’ death,
					Pericles undertook further reforms, including the introduction of pay for those
					serving in the courts, making it possible for even the poorest citizen to have
					his say. He is also believed to have helped drive Athens’ assertive
					foreign policy as the city sought to exploit its dominance of the Delian League.
					During the 440s and 430s BCE, Pericles was involved in an ambitious public
					building programme that provoked controversy at home, where he fought off
					revolt, and abroad, where he was condemned for requisitioning money from the
					Delian League to pay for the Parthenon. Nonetheless, he was popular and was
					elected as general every year from 443 BCE.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-47" class="calibre3">The Law Code of Hammurabi</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-48" class="calibre3">The palace at Knossos</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-49" class="calibre3">The Persian Wars</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-42" class="calibre3">The conquests of Alexander the Great</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-50" class="calibre3">The Peloponnesian Wars</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-31" class="calibre3">The fall of Constantinople</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

					Alexander marched into Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) at the head of an army of

					northwest, Alexander pressed on across Asia Minor. He stopped at Gordium in the
					central kingdom of Phrygia, where tradition held that he who could untie a
					complex knot made by the city’s founder, would conquer the entire

					sword. He went on to twice defeat the far superior forces gathered by Darius
					III, the Persian emperor &ndash; at Issus (on the southern coast of Asia Minor)
					in 333 BCE and Gaugamela (modern-day Iraq) in 331 BCE, subduing Egypt in the

				and to an extraordinary extent this is due to the will of one man: Qin Shi Huangdi,
				the self-styled First Emperor. Before he unified ancient China in 221 BCE, it was a
				region of diverse states, differing in culture, ethnicity, and language. During the
				era known to Chinese historians as the Spring and Autumn Period (771&ndash;476
				BCE), the region was nominally under the control of Zhou dynasty kings, but in
				reality their feudal system of government meant that only a token authority rested
				with the royal throne, while feudal lords held genuine power over what were
				effectively autonomous states. Up to 140 small states competed for power and
				territory.</p><p class="calibre14">The Spring and Autumn Period gave way to the Warring States Period (476&ndash;221
				BCE), in which power was consolidated into the hands of seven kingdoms: Qi, Chu,
				Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qin. At this point in China’s history it was by no
				means certain that an over-arching Chinese identity or state would emerge. If
				anything, it was more likely that the considerable geographical, climatic, cultural,
				and ethnic differences between the various kingdoms would see the region develop in
				a similar fashion to Europe many centuries later, with multiple distinct and
				divergent national entities.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-305"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000196.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-306" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The rise of Qin</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In 247 BCE, a 13-year-old prince named Ying Zheng succeeded to the throne of
					Qin. He inherited a militarized state, in which effective bureaucracy, powerful
					armies, and competent generals combined to produce a formidable and ruthless war
					machine. Zheng had rivals executed or exiled, appointed very effective generals
					and counsellors, and conquered the six other states in the region, so that by
					221 BCE all seven states were unified under his rule. Disdaining the old title
					of king (Wang), he styled himself as emperor (Huangdi). Since he was the first
					(Shi) emperor of the Qin dynasty, he was known as Qin Shi Huangdi.</p><p class="calibre14">The governing philosophy of the Qin state had been legalism: strict
					centralization of power and severity in enforcing adherence to the law. The
					emperor now set about applying this philosophy throughout the whole of China,
					ruthlessly imposing cultural, linguistic, economic, and technological unity. All
					scripts except Xiaozhuan (small seal script) were banned. In addition, according
					to legend, the emperor gave orders for 400 Confucian scholars to be buried alive
					and all existing books to be burned; his reign was to mark a new “Year
					One” in the history and culture of China. He also introduced a host of
					economic reforms &ndash; there was to be a single, unified system of weights
					and measures, a uniform coinage, and even the gauge of cart tracks was
					standardized so that axle-widths could be the same across the empire.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-307"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"When [Qin Shi Huangdi] is in difficulty he readily humbles himself before

					been underway since the Spring and Autumn Period. The feudal system was
					abolished, so that the mass of peasantry now owed their allegiance to the state
					rather than feudal or clan lords. Over 100,000 noble families were relocated to
					the emperor’s capital city Xianyang (near Xi’an, in the Shaanxi
					province), and their arms were confiscated, melted down, and then cast into
					giant statues. During the Warring States Period, the pressure of incessant
					military competition had generally favoured the emergence of more meritocratic
					avenues for advancement, thereby facilitating social mobility while undermining
					the importance of noble lineage. In the Qin dynasty, aristocratic rule was
					replaced with a centralized bureaucratic administration and the country was
					divided into 36 commanderies, which were administrative divisions controlled by
					appointed (not hereditary) governors. Censors, or inspectors, travelled the
					country to enforce adherence to Qin law.</p><p class="calibre14">The Qin dynasty also saw the emergence of a new scheme of social
					stratification, with society divided into four classes: gentlemen (<i class="calibre5">Shi</i>), peasants (<i class="calibre5">Nong</i>), and two new classes that had emerged during the Zhou
					dynasty &ndash; artisans (<i class="calibre5">Gong</i>) and
					merchants (<i class="calibre5">Shang</i>). The educated gentry would
					replace the nobility as the main source of state officials. The merchant class
					was officially the lowest and most despised of the orders, and was subject to
					legal discrimination; however, wealthy merchants were able to use their
					financial muscle to become important political players.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-309"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"With his puffed-out chest like a hawk and voice of a jackal, Qin is a man
						of scant mercy who has the heart of a wolf."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sima Qian <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">Han historian</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Great works</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Among Qin Shi Huangdi’s greatest achievements were his ambitious civil
					engineering projects, although there was a great human cost as many lost their
					lives in the process. He is traditionally credited with building the first part
					of the Great Wall of China, to keep out nomadic tribes in the north, by
					connecting parts of old walls erected by the Warring States and then adding
					thousands of miles of new wall. Other projects included constructing the Lingqu
					canal, which linked the Xiang and Li rivers so military supplies could be
					transported from northern to southern China, and building military roads
					including “the Straight Road”, which was 800km (497 miles) long
					and ran from Xianyang to the Great Wall.</p><p class="calibre14">Most famous of all the emperor’s ventures was the construction of his
					own elaborate mausoleum complex, which took 38 years and over 700,000 workers to
					construct. It consisted of a giant pyramid covered in earth to create an immense
					mound, 100m (328ft) high and 500m (1,640ft) across. Within the pyramid was a
					tomb in which his beloved empire was recreated in miniature, complete with
					liquid mercury rivers and seas. Buried around the tomb were large pits filled
					with thousands of life-sized terracotta warriors, bureaucrats, and entertainers,
					all intended to serve the emperor in the afterlife. Workers on the tomb were
					killed after completing their tasks so the secrets of the mausoleum’s
					location and contents died with them, and the tomb remained undiscovered for
					over 2,000 years.</p><p class="calibre14">Despite the megalomaniacal exertions of the First Emperor, the Qin dynasty was
					to prove short-lived. Peasant unrest caused by deep-seated resentment over the
					brutal extortions of money and the many years of forced labour, plus bankruptcy
					as a result of over-ambitious civil works, combined to undermine the carefully
					ordered administration of the emperor and his leading counsellors, chief among
					them the chancellor Li Si.</p><p class="calibre14">When the First Emperor died in 210 BCE his youngest son, Hu Hai, under the
					influence of advisor and former tutor Zhao Gao, seized the throne and exiled
					&ndash; and later executed &ndash; Li Si. Hu Hai was subsequently murdered
					after just three years of being in power and his successor, Zi Ying, found his
					authority so reduced that he adopted the title of king, rather than
					emperor.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-311"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000022.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Guarding the tomb</span> of Emperor Qin Shi

					Ying’s accession, the Han general Liu Bang marched into Xianyang. The
					following year, in 206 BCE, he declared himself emperor of the Han dynasty,
					which would go on to rule China for 400 years, shaping its subsequent history to
					such an extent that the main ethnic group in China is now known as the
					Han.</p><p class="calibre14">The Han expanded Chinese territory in all directions &ndash; west to Xinjiang
					and Central Asia, northeast to Manchuria and Korea, and south to Yunnan, Hainan,
					and Vietnam. Most importantly, they consumed the powerful Xiongnu Empire in the
					north. They also reintroduced Confucianism as the official state philosophy:
					Confucian education and ethics soon became the cornerstones of the
					scholar-bureaucracy, eventually forming the basis for the all-important civil
					service examination system, which would give a meritocratic basis to imperial
					institutions and combat the power of the aristocracy for millennia to
					come.</p><p class="calibre14">Han success in building and maintaining a unified, centralized China was based
					on the foundations that had been laid down by the First Emperor. The Han dynasty
					finally collapsed in 220 CE, amid a foment of civil unrest and natural disasters
					that convinced the Chinese that their dynasty had lost “the mandate of
					heaven”, giving way to the violent and chaotic era known as the Three
					Kingdoms and Six Dynasties Period. Despite the devastating cost of this
					breakdown, which saw the Chinese population plummet from 54 million in 156 CE to
					16 million in 280 CE, the concept of a unified China survived 360 years of
					division, enabling the Sui dynasty to reunify China in 581.</p><p class="calibre14">The influence of the First Emperor is still felt in modern China, and Chairman
					Mao Zedong (1893&ndash;1976) explicitly drew on the emperor for inspiration.
					“You accuse us of acting like Qin Shi Huangdi,” Mao thundered in a
					1958 tirade against intellectual critics. “You are wrong. We surpass him
					a hundred times. When you berate us for imitating his despotism, we are happy to
					agree! Your mistake was that you did not say so enough.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-313"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000180.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Confucius is generally</span> considered to be

					(260&ndash;210 BCE) was a truly pivotal figure in Chinese history, uniting the

					years. He was a brutal despot but was also innovative, dynamic, and energetic
					&ndash; reports claim that he needed just one hour’s sleep per night and
					he set himself a daily work quota, measured by the weight of papers that he
					needed to go through. He regularly walked the city streets in disguise to keep
					tabs on the populace, and he made five great tours of inspection of the empire.
					Highly paranoid and fearful of possible attempts on his life (he survived at
					least one assassination attempt), the emperor became obsessed with the quest for
					immortality, sponsoring expeditions to look for magic ingredients and mystics
					who could brew an elixir of life, to enable him to live forever. Ironically, his
					death at the age of 50 might well have been linked to his consumption of toxic
					mercury-based potions that he had taken to extend his life.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-155" class="calibre3">Emperor Wu claims the Mandate of

					the River Tiber, Rome grew into a city-state that was just one of many on the
					Italian peninsula. According to legend, Rome was first ruled by kings, but in
					509 BCE, the monarchy was overthrown and it became a republic. A new
					constitution allowed the election of two top officials, known as consuls, to run
					the state, but in order to prevent abuse of power, their term was limited to one
					year. The office of king was also prohibited, and special provision was made for
					the appointment of a dictator to replace the consuls in times of crisis &ndash;
					his term being limited to six months.</p><p class="calibre14">The fledgling Roman Republic proved remarkably successful: between 500 and 300
					BCE, it increased its extent and power through a combination of conquest and
					diplomacy until it incorporated the whole of Italy. Between 202 and 120 BCE,
					Rome came to dominate parts of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and
					what is now southern France. Its conquered territories were organized into
					provinces, ruled by short-term governors who maintained order and oversaw the
					collection of taxes.</p><p class="calibre14">By the 1st century BCE, Rome was a Mediterranean superpower, yet its long
					tradition of collective government, in which no individual could gain too much
					control, was being challenged by the personal ambitions of a few immensely
					powerful military men. A series of bloody civil wars, internal political
					struggles, and civil unrest culminated with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, a
					brilliant general and statesman, whose murder at the hands of his political
					enemies led to the demise of the republic and the birth of the Roman
					Empire.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-320"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000245.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Trajan’s column</span> in Rome is one

					scene (around 70 BCE), Rome was in turmoil: beset with ever worsening social and
					economic problems and torn by political conflict. Early in Rome’s
					history, the non-slave population had been officially split into two classes:
					the patricians (members of the ancient hereditary nobility and wealthy
					landowners) and the plebeians, or plebs for short (the common people). On the
					formation of the republic, only patricians had been entitled to hold office in
					the Senate &ndash; Rome’s governing and advisory council &ndash; but in
					368&ndash;367 BCE, a constitutional amendment allowed the election of wealthier
					plebs too, and the result was a power-sharing arrangement.</p><p class="calibre14">However, in reality, a small group of patrician families known as the
					Optimates (the “Best Men”) had long dominated the Senate and
					jealously guarded their privileges. In the late Roman Republic, those who
					championed the rights of the plebs &ndash; the Populares (the
					“People’s Men”) &ndash; sought popular support against the
					Optimates, either in the interests of the people themselves, or more often, in
					pursuit of their own careers. The self-interested Optimates resisted making the
					social and economic reforms that were urgently required to meet the changing
					needs of the Roman people. In Italy and the provinces an unequal system of
					taxation and corrupt governance were causing social unrest, while in the city of
					Rome itself, the infrastructure was barely able to cope with a growing
					population. The empire’s rapid expansion had brought a flood of slave
					labour from the provinces, driving many Roman farm workers and smallholders off
					the land and into the city in search of work.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-322"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"In Caesar were combined genius, method, memory, literature, prudence,

					to use their armies to jockey for political prominence. Among them was Julius
					Caesar, a highly intelligent and ambitious general from a patrician family who
					had aligned himself with the Populares and risen swiftly through the political
					ranks. Caesar was intent on making the reforms necessary to meet the challenges
					of the republic, and so he manoeuvred himself into a position that would allow
					him to achieve his goal.</p><p class="calibre14">In 60 BCE, Caesar became consul, and two years later he was appointed governor
					of the province of Gaul, a role which enabled him to remain abreast of
					developments in the Senate while also offering a springboard to military glory.
					In a series of masterful campaigns over the next eight years, he conquered Gaul,
					bringing the whole of what is now France, along with parts of Germany and
					Belgium, under his rule. He also led two expeditions to Britain, in 55 and 54
					BCE. Caesar’s heroic military exploits left him immensely rich and
					increased his personal prestige; he enjoyed the loyalty of his armies and the
					love of the Roman mob, upon whom he could now afford to lavish feasts, games,
					and money.</p><p class="calibre14">Buoyed by his achievements, Caesar attempted to dictate the terms on which he
					would return to Roman politics, demanding to be allowed to stand for a second
					consulship while remaining in command at Gaul. This put him on a collision
					course with the Optimates in the Senate, since Roman law required military
					leaders to relinquish control of their armies before entering Rome, a
					prerequisite for running for office. Caesar knew that if he agreed to enter the
					city as a private citizen, without his armies, his political opponents would
					most likely attempt to try him for abuse of power during his first
					consulship.</p><p class="calibre14">Back in Rome, the Optimates, alarmed by the implications of Caesar’s
					meteoric rise, allied themselves to one of his main political rivals, the
					renowned general Pompey. The Senate passed laws intending to strip Caesar of his
					command when he returned from Gaul, and in 49 BCE they declared him <i class="calibre5">hostis</i>, or public enemy. In response to this direct
					threat, Caesar did the unthinkable: he marched his army on Rome. En route, he
					paused at the border between the Gallic provinces and Italy proper: a small
					river called the Rubicon. Caesar was acutely aware that crossing the river would
					constitute a declaration of war against the Senate but, quoting the Athenian
					poet Menander, he announced “<i class="calibre5">alea iacta
						est</i>” (“let the dice roll”) and led his men
					onwards.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-324"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Even yet we may draw back, but once across that little bridge, and the

					at the Battle of Pharsalus in northern Greece in 48 BCE. The defeated Pompey
					fled to Egypt for sanctuary, where he was later assassinated. After crushing the
					remaining pockets of resistance, Caesar finally returned to Rome in 45 BCE, to
					consolidate his political position. In 46 BCE he accepted the dictatorship for
					10 years; two years later, he was granted the office for life. Now in a position
					to begin the monumental task of reconstructing the Roman state and restoring
					stability to the empire, Caesar initiated far-reaching social and political
					reforms. He extended Roman citizenship; he enlarged the Senate, bringing in
					allies from among the provincial aristocracy; he established colonies outside
					Italy, to help spread Roman culture and knit the empire together; he spent
					lavishly on grandiose public works and buildings; he cut taxes; and he even

					after years of chaos found favour with many parts of society, yet at the same
					time, his increasingly autocratic attitude to power was alienating fellow
					members of the ruling class. They felt that Caesar was trying to destroy the
					cherished traditions of the Roman state, and to undermine the prestige of the
					nobility, and spread the rumour that he was planning to make himself king.
					Unfortunately, Caesar failed to quell the suspicions. He accepted unprecedented
					honours, such as assuming the title “Imperator”
					(“Victorious General”) as a family name; he also allowed temples
					and statues to be erected in his honour, and had coins minted bearing his image.
					And when he adopted his grand-nephew, Octavian, there were fears that he was
					trying to establish a dynastic succession. Some members of the Senate concluded
					that the only solution to the problem was to assassinate Caesar, and so they
					hatched a conspiracy to carry it out.</p><p class="calibre14">Representing those opposed to the dictator’s reforms &ndash; and the
					leading agent in the plot to murder him &ndash; Gaius Cassius Longinus was a
					general who had risen to political prominence during a largely disastrous
					campaign in Persia. Ancient Roman historians argued that Cassius’s
					involvement was prompted by a combination of jealousy and greed. He is also said
					to have recruited the most important conspirator, Marcus Junius Brutus, a
					trusted colleague and confidante of Caesar, opposed to the dictator’s
					presumed monarchic ambitions.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Death of a dictator</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The assassination plot grew rapidly, eventually including 60 senators, among
					them many of Caesar’s close colleagues. The plotters decided to strike at
					a meeting of the Senate that had been called for 15 March, (the Ides of March).
					On the day, they gathered at Cassius’s home, each senator concealing a
					dagger beneath his robes, before moving on to Pompey’s Theatre &ndash;
					part of a great civic complex that Caesar’s old rival had constructed
					&ndash; where the Senate was meeting. A group of gladiators had been stationed
					in the theatre itself, to help control any crowd problems. However, many of the
					conspirators were nervous and ready to flee, convinced that the plot had been
					uncovered.</p><p class="calibre14">Caesar had indeed been warned: a list of the plotters had been thrust into his
					hands, but he ignored it. His wife pleaded with him not to attend the Senate
					meeting, but one of the conspirators, stationed at Caesar’s house, helped
					calm her fears. When Caesar arrived at the meeting, a conspirator distracted his
					deputy, Mark Anthony, delaying him outside the theatre. As Caesar took his seat,
					the conspirators drew their daggers and struck, stabbing him 23 times. In an
					ironic twist, Caesar breathed his last slumped against the base of a statue of
					his old rival Pompey.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-329"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"I found Rome a city of bricks, and left it a city of marble."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Augustus <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">According to Suetonius, Augustus’s

					Caesar’s blood and rushed out into the Forum to proclaim their
					tyrannicide. In the power vacuum that followed, Mark Anthony, and
					Caesar’s heir, Octavian, promptly assumed control of the state, forming
					in 43 BCE a triumvirate (a group of three men holding power) with Lepidus, one
					of Caesar’s former allies.</p><p class="calibre14">Needing to gather enough funds to stabilize their authority, and to remove
					political opposition, the triumvirate drew up a list of those who had supported
					Caesar’s murderers, and declared them outlaws. Around 200 senators and
					more than 2,000 equites (“knights” or minor nobility) were either
					killed or had their estates confiscated. The treasury’s coffers now
					filled, the triumvirate hunted down and destroyed Brutus and Cassius. In 40 BCE,
					the triumvirs met again, this time to carve up the Roman world. Africa was given
					to Lepidus, the East to Mark Anthony, and the West to Octavian. However, it was
					not long before Octavian went to war against Anthony in north Africa, and, after
					defeating his forces at Actium in western Greece in 31 BCE, Octavian became the
					master of the Roman world.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-331"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Caesar, like a most gentle physician, had been assigned to the Romans by

					example, he renounced the dictatorial powers granted to him in order to wage his
					war against Antony. In 27 BCE, in gratitude for his service to Rome, the Senate
					bestowed on him the name Augustus (“revered personage”) and
					granted him wide-ranging legal powers. Eventually, through political sleight of
					hand, he became Rome’s sole ruler, controlling all aspects of the Roman
					state and command of the army.</p><p class="calibre14">An emperor in all but name (he was careful to spurn such titles, styling
					himself instead as princeps, or “first citizen”), over the next
					four decades, Augustus set about transforming the ruins of the republican system
					into an imperial autocracy, all the while maintaining the illusion that his
					authority was dependent on the will of the people. He loosely established the
					boundaries of the empire, pushed through reforms to clean up both private and
					public life, and crushed dissent. After the long periods of exhausting civil
					war, many in the empire were grateful for peace.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-333" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Pax Romana</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Indeed the might of the Roman military and the consequent improvements in
					security and stability across a vast stretch of territory, in what became known
					as the Pax Romana (“Roman Peace”), led to a growth in trade,
					economic activity, population, and general prosperity. The arts and culture
					flourished, public and private building works proliferated, and the provinces
					outside Italy underwent a process of Romanization, in which the Roman language,
					culture, laws, and institutions were embedded into diverse societies and across
					ethnic boundaries. Provincials were even granted full Roman citizenship after a
					period of military service.</p><p class="calibre14">However, for the regions beyond the bounds of empire, Augustus’s Pax
					Romana often meant just the opposite. Even after reducing the army from 80
					legions to a permanent force of just 28, Augustus had to find employment for
					150,000 soldiers. He launched a series of campaigns to extend borders, suppress
					and harry rebels and “barbarians”, and seize slaves from conquered
					areas.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-334"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000091.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Ara Pacis Augustae</span> altar in Rome is

					system that would endure for centuries. For some years before his death,
					Augustus had prepared the way for an heir to succeed him, and retain control of
					the state. His step-son Tiberius was gradually granted powers until he could
					effectively be considered to be a co-emperor. This smoothed the transition of
					authority on Augustus’ death, preventing a vacuum of power and ensuring
					continuity.</p><p class="calibre14">Augustus thus established the principle of direct succession and ensured the
					survival of the office of emperor. The system continued through multiple
					dynasties, with the empire reaching its height under the Nerva-Antonine dynasty
					when emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall in northern Britain to mark
					the empire’s outer limit.</p><p class="calibre14">The transition from republic to monarchy, while drastic, gave Rome a new
					stability. Masquerading as a democrat, Augustus created a new autocratic system
					of government, which, despite restricting political participation, was much
					better able to resist the compulsive upheavals that had plagued the Roman
					Republic a generation before.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-336"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Bear with me the hope that when I die, that the foundations which have

					distinguished ancestry. From an early age, he grasped that money was the key to
					power in a political system that had become hopelessly corrupt. He also quickly
					learned that forging a network of alliance and patronage would be crucial to his
					success.</p><p class="calibre11">After serving in the war to crush the slave revolt led by Spartacus in 72 BCE,
					Caesar was briefly taken hostage by pirates. Once he returned to Rome in 60 BCE,
					Caesar spent vast sums on buying influence and positions, eventually teaming up
					with the two other leading men in Rome, Crassus and Pompey, to form the
					so-called First Triumvirate. Between 58 and 50 BCE, he formed a provincial power
					base in Gaul where, without the sanction of the Senate, he launched a series of
					campaigns that made him master of Western Europe, with fabulous wealth and
					powerful armies. However, these campaigns also earned him many opponents among
					the governing classes, who would eventually cut short both his career and his

				Bridge near Rome, waiting to join battle with Maxentius, his rival for control of
				the Western Roman Empire (in 285, the empire had been split into two halves, eastern
				and western, each ruled by an emperor and a deputy). Tradition says that in the days
				before the encounter, Constantine had a vision of a flaming cross in the heavens
				bearing the inscription <i class="calibre5">in hoc signo vinces</i>
				(“by this sign conquer”). This convinced him that he had the support
				of the god of the Christians, and this belief was upheld when his army went on to
				defeat Maxentius’s men. In fact, the Christian god was not the first deity
				Constantine had auditioned; an earlier version of his vision had involved the Greek
				and Roman god Apollo. He appears to have been looking for theological
				“back-up” to legitimize his ambition to become sole emperor, and a
				monotheistic supreme being may have seemed to him a good fit: a heavenly mirror
				image of his own position on Earth. Despite the legend of his divine vision,
				Constantine’s conversion to Christianity seems to have been gradual rather
				than immediate &ndash; he was not baptized until many years later, on his deathbed.
				However, soon after his victory at the Milvian Bridge, he began the process of
				rehabilitating, and then exalting, Christianity; in 331 CE, he issued the Edict of
				Milan, a proclamation that established religious toleration for Christianity within
				the empire.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-341"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000141.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-342" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A multi-faith empire</h2></div><p class="calibre15">For almost 300 years after the life of Jesus Christ, the religion based on his
					teachings remained a minor sect within the Roman Empire, practised alongside
					many other faiths, both mono- and polytheistic. Some aspects of Christianity,
					such as its egalitarian nature, made it suspicious to the imperial authorities
					however, and Christians were periodically persecuted.</p><p class="calibre14">All across the ancient world at this time, changing social, political, and
					economic conditions were reflected in cultural and religious changes;
					Christianity was just one of a number of monotheisms gaining popularity in the
					Roman Empire, including the Persian cult of Mithraism, with which it had much in
					common.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-343" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The rise of Christianity</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In 324, after disposing of the emperor in the East, Constantine became sole
					ruler of the Roman Empire, and then sought to use Christianity as a unifying
					force across his diverse and fractious realm. To make the increasingly dominant
					eastern half easier to govern, he founded a new city called Constantinople (now
					Istanbul), consecrating it with both Christian and pagan rites, but allowing
					only Christian churches to be built. Although it would take time for all Roman
					citizens to convert to Christianity, in Constantine’s reign, the higher
					ranks of society, seeking political advancement and personal favour with the
					emperor, flocked to the Church, and the emperor built basilicas across the
					empire.</p><p class="calibre14">Christianity, however, was not a single, uniform religion at this time, and
					splits, or schisms, formed. In 325, Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea
					&ndash; the first universal council of the Christian Church &ndash; mainly to
					settle the Arian schism, a theological dispute over whether Jesus was of the
					same substance as God.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-344"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000168.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Constantine I’s adoption</span> of

					adopted and moulded the Church into an instrument of social and political
					control, unity, and stability.</p><p class="calibre14">Under Emperor Theodosius I (reigned 379&ndash;395), pagan temples and cults
					were suppressed, heresy was outlawed, and Christianity became the official
					religion of the Roman Empire. Eventually, it also became the faith of the
					barbarian successor states in the Roman Western Empire, as well as of the
					Byzantine Empire in the East. Over the course of many centuries, the western
					(Catholic) and eastern (Orthodox) churches grew apart in doctrine and

				was relatively restrained, the sack sent shock waves across the world. Changes known

				great movements of peoples across all of Eurasia, from China to Britain. Barbarian
				peoples began to invade settled empires such as those of Rome and China from around
				300 to 650. They carved out new kingdoms, which in many cases gave rise to the
				nations of the modern era. Climatic changes in Central Asia drove the nomadic horse
				tribes of the steppes to seek better pastures, which in turn forced neighbouring
				nomads to invade the so-called civilized empires. China was ravaged by the Xiongnu,
				Persia by the Hepthalites, and India by the White Huns.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-348"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000356.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-349" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Barbarians at the gates</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In Europe, the arrival of the Huns in the lands east of the Rhine and north of
					the Danube displaced Germanic tribes who had long lived in delicate balance with
					the Roman Empire. The Visigoths moved into Roman lands, eventually storming Rome
					in 410, while other tribes including the Vandals, Suevi, Alans, Franks,
					Burgundians, and Alemanni invaded and settled territory from Gaul to Spain to
					North Africa. In the 440s the Huns, under Attila, ravaged Eastern Europe before
					being defeated by a coalition of Romans and Germans. The Western Roman Empire
					shrank to encompass little more than Italy itself, its puppet emperors
					controlled by barbarian generals. In 476, the last nominal emperor was deposed
					by one such general, Odoacer, marking the end of the Roman Empire in the
					west.</p><p class="calibre14">The Western Empire had however been in decline since at least the 3rd century.
					Its population and economy had diminished, making it increasingly financially
					dependent on the Eastern Empire; weakening central authority had given more
					autonomy to the provinces. The military, obliged to recruit from barbarian
					tribes, was losing its core strength. In reality, the Barbarian Invasions were
					probably part of a process: a transition, rather than a fall. Roman customs,
					culture, language, and particularly its religion in the form of Christianity,
					endured across the provinces, and many of the new ruling elite saw themselves as
					continuing in the tradition of Rome. The city itself survived sack by Alaric and
					his Visigoths, and by the Vandals in 455, and flourished under Theodoric the
					Ostrogoth (489&ndash;526).</p><p class="calibre14">In their turn, the successor states formed by Germanic tribes over the

					either Germanic auxiliaries and mercenaries, or Roman citizens who were actually
					Gauls, Britons, or one of the hundreds of other groups and ethnicities.
					Nevertheless, much Roman culture survived the invasions. For instance, although

				Ages”, seeing it as a separate era sandwiched between the ancient world and
				modern times. In reality, there was never a clear break with the ancient world. In
				the eastern Mediterranean, the Roman Empire continued for almost 1,000 years after
				the fall of Rome, although it was rebranded by historians as the Byzantine Empire.
				The ancient tradition of a united China ruled by an emperor was revived in the 6th
				century and continued to the Ming dynasty, albeit with interruptions. Even in
				Western Europe, where the breakdown after the Roman Empire’s collapse was
				most evident, Christian religion survived in Rome as the key marker for the
				distinction between what were considered “civilized” and
				“barbarian” societies.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-360"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000251.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-361" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The rise of Islam</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The dominance of two mutually hostile monotheistic religions &ndash;
					Christianity and Islam &ndash; was the most distinctive characteristic of this
					period across much of Eurasia. The founding of Islam in the 7th century was a
					transformative event, and Arab armies inspired by the faith altered the
					political landscape: Muslim rule spread from Spain in the west to central Asia
					in the east.</p><p class="calibre14">Although a united Islamic caliphate could not be sustained, the religion
					ensured a continuity of civilization even when power shifted from the Arabs to
					other peoples such as the Turks. The great cities of the Muslim world surpassed
					any in Christendom in size and sophistication, and Muslim scholars preserved the
					science of the ancient Greeks and built upon it. Islamic civilization remained
					dynamic and expansive throughout the entire medieval period.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-362" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Western European fortunes</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In Western Europe, civilization fell drastically from the level achieved under
					the Roman Empire. Warrior kings ruled over a thinly spread population sustained
					by subsistence agriculture, and the area remained prey to non-Christian raiders
					and invaders, such as the Vikings and the Magyars, into the 10th century.</p><p class="calibre14">A nostalgia for ancient Rome led to King Charlemagne being crowned emperor in
					800, but the Holy Roman Empire, based on the tradition Charlemagne founded,
					failed to unify Western Europe politically. In the absence of strong centralized
					state systems, feudal relationships held societies together.</p><p class="calibre14">From the 11th century, a revival of Western European culture, trade, and urban
					life gathered pace. The “Medieval Warm Period” (950&ndash;1250),
					when Europe experienced above-average temperatures, improved yields from
					agriculture; it was also a time when great cathedrals and castles were
					constructed. But even when the Christian crusaders fought their way to Jerusalem
					at the heart of the Muslim world, the flow of civilization was the other way,
					with Islamic scholars far advanced in medicine, philosophy, astronomy, and
					geography.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-363" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Expansion and contraction</h2></div><p class="calibre15">By the 13th century, the world’s population is believed to have risen
					to around 400 million &ndash; double its total at the high point of the ancient
					empires. A wide-ranging network linked Europe to China and the thriving trading
					kingdoms of Asia, by land along the Silk Road and by sea across the Indian
					Ocean. Cairo and Venice both became wealthy cities as focal points at the
					western end of this trade.</p><p class="calibre14">However, civilized life remained precarious. The Mongols &ndash; nomadic
					warriors from the Asian steppes &ndash;seized major cities from the Middle East
					to southern China, carrying out large-scale massacres. Lethal diseases were also
					highly prevalent. Carried along the trade routes in the mid-14th century, the
					Black Death epidemic may have killed a quarter of the world’s
					population.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Inventions and progress</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Technological progress was slow but cumulatively substantial. As the
					world’s most advanced country, China was the ultimate source of most
					inventions, from paper and printing to the magnetic compass and gunpowder. Even
					relatively backward Europe benefited from improvements in shipbuilding and
					metalworking, and the invention and spread of the plough and the windmill
					transformed agriculture.</p><p class="calibre14">By the end of the Middle Ages, Western European kingdoms had developed from
					“feudal” states, based on oaths of loyalty, to more stable and
					centralized states, able to channel their key resources into the large projects
					of colonization and exploration. In the Americas, meanwhile, civilizations such
					as the Aztecs and Incas continued to evolve independently, untouched by
					developments in Eurasia and Africa, until the Spanish conquistadors arrived in
					the 16th century.</p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				the city’s current defenders, the barbarian Ostrogoths, who were fleeing

					barbarian invasions, the eastern portion &ndash; the Byzantine Empire, with its
					capital at Constantinople (modern Istanbul) &ndash; weathered the storm, its
					retention of rich provinces, such as Egypt, enabling it to mount a successful
					defence of its territory. However, the loss of the empire’s birthplace
					was a blow to the prestige of the Byzantine emperors, who refused to accept it.
					In 488, the Emperor Zeno despatched one tribe of Germanic barbarian mercenaries,
					the Ostrogoths, to remove another, led by Odoacer, who had been responsible for
					deposing the last Western Roman emperor. In return the Ostrogoths would be
					allowed to rule Italy as subjects of the Byzantine Emperor. Furthermore, the
					Goths had been encroaching on imperial lands, and so Zeno hoped their removal to
					Italy would neutralize both problems.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-368"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000358.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Gothic War</h2></div><p class="calibre15">For the following 40 years, the Goths’ rule of Italy was relatively
					untroubled. However, the accession of Justinian (c.482&ndash;565) as Byzantine
					emperor in 527 changed things. He was determined to restore Roman dignity, and
					this meant reconquering the lost Roman provinces. He began in 533 by despatching
					an army to North Africa under general Belisarius, who swiftly defeated the
					Vandals (a Germanic people who had ruled there since the 430s).</p><p class="calibre14">Emboldened by his success, Justinian ordered an invasion of Italy in 535.
					Belisarius’s army made rapid progress and in 536 they successfully
					recaptured Rome. Byzantine euphoria at the recovery of their ancient capital was
					rudely shattered however when the Gothic King Witigis counter-attacked and
					subjected Rome to a grinding, year-long siege.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-370"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000383.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Emperor Justinian</span>, a man of great

					to fear that he would set himself up as an independent king in Italy. The

					again both times to the Romans. Finally, the last major Gothic army was defeated
					in 552.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-372"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"To find money in Italy for the war is impossible, since the country has

Italy was
					devastated &ndash; the cities had lost much of their population and the rural
					economy was in tatters. The traditional Latin-speaking ruling classes found that
					Greek-speakers from Constantinople were given all the key positions. Rome was
					treated as a provincial outpost of the Byzantine Empire and hopes that the city
					might be restored as the centre of imperial power were dashed.</p><p class="calibre14">The effects of the war, together with a plague that killed one-third of the
					empire’s inhabitants in 542, made it hard to find troops that could
					garrison Italy. The new province provided little tax revenue and it became a
					major financial drain. The optimism that greeted the capture of Rome was
					replaced by a profound gloom &ndash; a mood confirmed when in 568 the Lombards,
					another barbarian group, invaded Italy and took most of the Byzantine land in
					north and central Italy.</p><p class="calibre14">Although the Byzantine Empire survived a further nine centuries, it was never
					again able to make another serious attempt to restore the Roman Empire in the
					west. Instead, it focused on defending its Greek-speaking core in the east,
					leaving the Germanic kingdoms in Italy, France, and Spain free to develop
					unhindered.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-43" class="calibre3">The Battle of Milvian Bridge</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-44" class="calibre3">The Sack of Rome</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre3">The fall of Jerusalem</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-148" class="calibre3">The Great Schism</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-31" class="calibre3">The fall of Constantinople</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				that he had received a divine message from the angel Gabriel. This was followed by

					Arabia, which derived their wealth from the spice trade. In the early days, the
					trade routes ran along the northwest coast, but by the 7th century these had
					diminished as merchants increasingly used a maritime route up the Red Sea,
					leaving many places that had been relatively prosperous in decline. There were a
					few scattered towns, such as Medina (then known as Yathrib) and Mecca, which
					were dependent on more local trade in wool and leather, along with a few key
					imports such as grain and olive oil. The central desert regions of the Arabian
					peninsula were very poor: Bedouin tribes followed a nomadic lifestyle, and
					competition for scarce resources shaped a society in which primary loyalty was
					to a kinship group, or tribe.</p><p class="calibre14">At the time of Muhammad, Arabia was in a state of religious and political
					ferment. Strong Jewish communities had become established in Yemen in the south
					and in northwestern oasis towns, such as Medina, while Christianity had gained
					footholds in Yemen and eastern Arabia. Although monotheistic faiths were making
					inroads against the traditional polytheistic paganism of the Bedouin Arabs,
					paganism still remained strong. Conflict between tribes was also common, and in
					Mecca, in the sacred enclosure known as the <i class="calibre5">haram</i>, a truce was enforced so men of different tribes could
					trade freely without violence.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-378" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Muhammad in Mecca</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Meccan <i class="calibre5">haram</i> was controlled by the

					rejection of paganism, and his bold proclamation that there was but a single
					God, and that believers needed to follow a prescribed set of religious
					observances &ndash; including praying five times a day and fasting during
					Ramadan &ndash; set his followers apart. His preaching of a single religious
					community that cut across social boundaries was perceived as threatening by the
					traditional leaders, who felt it undermined the source of their
					authority.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-379"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000050.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In this 16th-century</span> miniature the Kaaba,

					handful of followers fled north to Medina &ndash; an event called the <i class="calibre5">hijra</i> (meaning emigration), which marked the real
					foundation of the Islamic community. The Medinans, who resented the power of the
					Mecca-based Qurayshi, were sympathetic to Muhammad’s cause and allowed
					him to preach freely, giving him the opportunity to attract further
					converts.</p><p class="calibre14">The Qurayshi were not content to see Muhammad’s powerbase grow in Mecca
					and within two years violence had broken out between the established powers
					there and Muhammad’s supporters. Muhammad outmanoeuvred the Qurayshi,
					first by raiding their caravans, then defeating them in a pitched battle in 627,
					and finally negotiating the right to return to Mecca on a pilgrimage in 629. By
					the time he died in 632, Muhammad was re-established in Mecca, and his
					diplomatic and military successes in attracting other tribes to his cause had
					made his position unassailable. As his authority spread, so too did the reach of
					his religious message and the numbers of new Muslim converts.</p><p class="calibre14">After Muhammad’s death, Islam entered a crisis and the fledgling
					religion might easily have been crushed. Tribes in the east broke away from the
					Muslim religious community (the <i class="calibre5">umma</i>) and
					declared allegiance to their own prophet, while the Medinans were unhappy about
					the dominance of Meccans in the movement. The choice of Abu Bakr,
					Muhammad’s father-in-law, as caliph (successor) signalled that the
					leadership would remain in the Prophet’s family and this, together with a
					series of successful military campaigns against the malcontents, enabled the

					Umar (634&ndash;44), initiated campaigns of conquest further afield. They were
					fortunate in that profound changes had occurred on the northern fringes of
					Arabia. Between 602 and 628, the two long-established empires in the area
					&ndash; the Byzantines to the northwest and the Persian Sassanids to the
					northeast &ndash; had been engaged in a long, vicious war that ended in
					catastrophe for both parties. Their coffers had been drained by the costs of the
					conflict and some regions within their territories had been utterly devastated.
					Both sides had also become reliant on Arabs to defend their borders and small,
					semi-independent Arab states had emerged on the peripheries of the two
					empires.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-383" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Rapid defeat</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Arab armies that swept northwards in the 630s faced far less resistance
					than they would have half a century earlier. Provinces fell easily as weakened
					garrisons and the doubtful loyalty of citizens undermined resistance. Although
					relatively small in number and lightly armed, the Arab armies were very mobile
					and did not need to defend fixed positions, giving them a huge advantage over
					their opponents. When they defeated the Byzantines at Yarmuk in 636, the whole

					inhabitants converted, while those who did not were tolerated if they were
					Christians, Jews, or Zoroastrians, provided they paid a special tax. Islam
					transformed the lands it absorbed in many ways. As well as sweeping away the old
					imperial structures, it imparted a new sense of religious community, often
					uniting the conquerors and the conquered. Islamic scholars resurrected the works
					of Greek philosophers and scientists that had languished forgotten for
					centuries, translating them into Arabic, and beautiful mosques began to adorn
					the towns. Areas that had been marginalized under the Byzantine or Sassanid
					Empires now found themselves at the heart of a new, vibrant civilization.</p><p class="calibre14">Success, however, brought its own problems for Islam. Acquiring lands far more
					urbanized than Arabia meant that the caliphs had to adapt from being warrior
					chiefs commanding a tight-knit group of followers, to monarchs ruling over a
					huge area with complex economies and societies. In addition to this, Muslims
					were initially in the minority, and not wholly united.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-386" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Growing divisions</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Tensions over the succession to the caliphate resulted in a major schism in
					Islam. A struggle between Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law, and Muawiya, the
					Governor of Syria, led to a civil war that ended in Ali’s murder and
					Muawiya taking control of the caliphate in 661. While Muawiya’s
					descendants (the Umayyads) ruled from the Syrian city of Damascus, Ali’s
					followers opposed their authority, claiming the caliph should be chosen from
					among Ali’s offspring. After the murder of Ali’s son Husayn at
					Karbala in 680, the split between the Shia (those who supported the right of
					Ali’s descendants to rule the caliphate) and the more mainstream Sunni
					(who rejected this) became definitive &ndash; a division that continues to this
					day.</p><p class="calibre14">Islamic unity was fractured in other ways too; ruling over such a vast empire
					was almost impossible when messages from the eastern and western extremities
					might take months to reach the caliph’s court. Independent Muslim
					dynasties emerged in peripheral areas and rival caliphs appeared in the 10th
					century in Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt. Yet even though its political unity had
					been shattered, and its religious unity compromised, Muhammad’s creed was
					so popular and successful that by the 21st century there were about 1.5 billion
					Muslims worldwide.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-387"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MUHAMMAD<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><p class="intro">The Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 to a branch of the
					influential Quraysh tribe. Tradition relates that he was an orphan, whose first
					marriage to a wealthy widow named Khadijah secured his economic future. The
					religious revelations that were imparted to Muhammad over a period of about 12
					years from about 610 &ndash; and which would later be written down as the
					Qur’an &ndash; caused a rupture with the traditional Meccan elites when
					he began to preach against pagan polytheism and practices such as female
					infanticide. Muhammad’s flight to Medina in 622 marked a key moment in
					the spread of Islam, as its acceptance outside Mecca showed that its appeal
					might transcend traditional kinship structures. Muhammad proved an inspirational
					leader, and his adept handling of the challenges facing the new religion meant
					that by the time of his death in 632, two years after his return to Mecca, its
					adherents had spread throughout Arabia.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-29" class="calibre3">The founding of Baghdad</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre3">The fall of Jerusalem</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-70" class="calibre3">Mansa Musa’s <i class="calibre5">hajj</i> to Mecca</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-159" class="calibre3">The Arab advance is halted at

					strengthened Frankish administration, establishing a network of <i class="calibre5">missi domenici</i> &ndash; royal agents who would

					them into a single political entity.</p><p class="calibre14">By contrast, the Papacy had experienced difficult times in the 8th century,
					snared in petty power politics as various Roman noble families sought to secure
					positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. After Leo was assaulted in Rome in
					799 he fled across the Alps to seek help from Charlemagne, inviting him to bring

					dividing the kingdom between several heirs weakened central authority and led to
					civil wars; it also allowed the emergence of powerful landowners, who often
					challenged royal authority. Ultimately, the empire split into two main portions,
					which roughly equate to France and Germany today. The title of emperor was
					passed down to the immediate descendants of Charlemagne and then, from the 10th

				deep into Central Asia, and established a centralized government with a highly
				competent bureaucracy to administer the empire. Later rulers presided over long
				periods of peace, relative political stability, and economic growth that triggered a
				cultural and artistic renaissance and technological innovation.</p><p class="calibre14">But in 755, this golden age was violently interrupted by An Lushan, a discontented
				army general who led an internal rebellion against the Tang that plunged northern
				China into a devastating war, after which the dynasty was never again fully in
				control of the country.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-399"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000380.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-400" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The seeds of rebellion</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Under Xuanzong (712&ndash;56), the Tang dynasty reached the zenith of its
					power and prestige, yet several key economic, social, and political issues
					threatened to destabilize it.</p><p class="calibre14">Firstly, the state was struggling to raise sufficient taxes to fund a sharp
					rise in military expenditure. The <i class="calibre5">fu-bing</i>,
					the cost-effective and self-supporting national militia system in which soldiers
					worked the land when not required for active military duty, was proving
					inadequate in the face of repeated invasions by neighbouring groups. Xuanzong
					was forced to establish military provinces along China’s northern
					frontiers, headed by local governors who commanded huge armies, and who came to
					acquire considerable power and autonomy.</p><p class="calibre14">The Tang’s coffers were drained further by the failure of the
					“equal field” system, a programme of land distribution and tax
					collection that protected small farmers from the depredations of wealthy
					landowners by periodically reallocating land to them. Its gradual demise enabled
					the nobility to grab land to increase their regional power bases, and led to
					unrest among the peasantry.</p><p class="calibre14">Lastly, earlier reforms made by Emperor Taizong (reigned 626&ndash;649) to
					the examination system used to recruit civil servants, which opened it up to
					able men from humbler backgrounds without connections, had created a bureaucracy
					based on merit that eroded the power and influence of the aristocracy. Xuanzong
					now had to manage rival factions in his court &ndash; potentially rebellious
					nobles, ambitious professional bureaucrats, and military governors, some of whom
					had begun to intervene in politics.</p><p class="calibre14">However, it was a series of military debacles that provided the spark for
					revolt against the Tang, including the defeat by Abbasid Arabs in 751 that
					halted China’s expansion into Central Asia.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-401"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000140.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">An Lushan’s rebels</span> conquered and

					that the era of conquest was over. An Lushan, a prominent military governor who
					had become a court favourite, rose up against his masters. Claiming that the
					emperor had asked him to remove Yang Guozhong (the court’s chief
					minister, with whom An Lushan was engaged in an intense power struggle), he
					mobilized a rebel army and marched south.</p><p class="calibre14">At first the revolt looked set for success: it captured the eastern capital,
					Luoyang, early in 756 &ndash; where An Lushan declared a rival dynasty, the Yan
					&ndash; before storming Chang’an, the primary capital. Xuanzong fled
					from his court, only just escaping An Lushan’s clutches.</p><p class="calibre14">After eight years of war, the Tang finally crushed the revolt, but the effort
					had fatally weakened it. Over the next century it lost more political power to
					the military, and further rebellions broke out. By 907, the empire had
					fragmented into local dynasties and kingdoms that vied for power for 50
					years.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-403"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Ten thousand houses with stabbed hearts emit the smoke of

					growing Islamic empire (or caliphate). Following the murder in 744 of the caliph
					al-Walid, a member of the Umayyad family that had ruled from Damascus since 661,
					civil war broke out, ending only when the Abbasid dynasty came to power in 750.
					The Abbasids spent their first decade pacifying the empire, with the help of
					troops from Khurasan in northeastern Iran. These troops, a mixture of
					Arab-speakers, Persians and central Asians, had been among the Abbasids’
					principal backers and had provided them with a power base independent of the
					Arab tribes based in northern Arabia, Syria, and Iraq who had supported the
					Umayyads.</p><p class="calibre14">It was in part to provide land for his Khurasani soldiers that al-Mansur, the
					second Abbasid caliph, established the city of Baghdad in 762. He chose the site
					for its mild climate and its location on the trade routes between Persia,
					Arabia, and the Mediterranean. It was also just 20 miles to the southeast of the
					Persian royal seat at Ctesiphon, which it soon eclipsed, enabling the new
					dynasty to portray themselves as masters of a culture that stretched back to
					Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BCE. The heart of the new capital was a
					mile-wide, circular enclosure in which sat the caliphal palace and main
					government offices.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-408" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Search for knowledge</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Abbasids laid claim not only to their predecessors’ political
					heritage, but also to their cultural and scientific achievements. Although the
					Umayyad Empire had included ancient seats of Greek learning such as Alexandria
					in Egypt, under their rule there had been little sponsorship of scientific
					endeavour. This changed under the Abbasids, who spent their time consolidating
					Islamic rule rather than on campaigns of conquest. They sponsored scholars to
					explore knowledge gained from foreign works, rather than relying solely on the
					guidance found in the Koran and the <i class="calibre5">hadiths</i>
					(the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad).</p><p class="calibre14">The earliest advances were made in medicine. During the mid- to late 6th
					century, a philosophical school at Gondeshapur in south-western Iran became a
					centre of medical scholarship. It was staffed mainly by Christians from the
					Nestorian sect, which had been persecuted in the Byzantine Empire. In 765,
					al-Mansur is said to have summoned staff member Jurjis ibn Jibril ibn Bukhtishu
					to Baghdad to diagnose a stomach complaint. So pleased was the caliph with his
					treatment that he prevailed upon Jurjis to stay on as his personal physician,
					and for eight generations until the mid-11th century members of the Bukhtishu
					family occupied the position at the Baghdad court, bringing with them knowledge
					of Greek and Hellenistic texts and medical practices. In 800, Caliph Harun
					al-Rashid asked Jibril ibn Bukhtishu, Jurjis’s grandson, to head the new
					hospital in Baghdad, the first in the Islamic world.</p><p class="calibre14">Al-Mansur established a library in Baghdad to house his collection of
					manuscripts. This venture was made easier by the Arab adoption of paper as a
					medium for books, and the establishment in Baghdad in 795 of a paper mill.
					However, since Arabic speakers had no access to this learning, the library did
					little to advance an indigenous Arab scientific tradition.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-409"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"In addition to his profound knowledge of logic and law [al-Mansur... was]

					813&ndash;833) established the <i class="calibre5">Bayt al Hikma</i>
					(House of Wisdom), which not only housed the growing library, but also acted as
					an academy for scholars and a centre for the translation of key scientific works
					into Arabic. Among its leading scholars were Hunayn ibn Ishaq (808&ndash;873),
					a Nestorian Christian from al-Hira in Iraq, who translated more than 100 mostly
					medical and philosophical works; and Thabit ibn Qurra, a member of a pagan sect
					known as the Sabaeans, who translated <i class="calibre5">Elements</i>, Euclid’s great work on geometry, and the
						<i class="calibre5">Almagest</i>, Ptolemy’s key work on
					astronomy.</p><p class="calibre14">Translation became a highly prestigious endeavour. One Arab patron paid an
					extravagant 2,000 dinars a month to ensure his association with a translation of
					a work by the Greek physician Galen (a dinar, made of pure gold, weighed the
					same as 72 grains of barley). Within around 150 years, almost all of the key
					Greek texts that had been discovered had been rendered into Arabic. Many of them
					were not available in Western Europe at all, and even if they had been,
					knowledge of Greek had all but disappeared there. The Muslim world was therefore
					well set by around 850 to build on the scientific traditions of Classical and
					Hellenistic Greeks transmitted and developed under the Roman Empire &ndash; and
					to acquire a centuries-long lead over Christian Western Europeans.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-411"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000013.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The House of Wisdom</span> played host to

					of the times at which Muslims must observe their five daily prayers (times which
					varied widely across the vast Islamic Empire), therefore both disciplines were
					studied assiduously. Another, separate, intellectual tradition contributed to
					the development of these calculation techniques, arriving in 771 with a
					delegation of Hindu scholars. The scholars were visiting al-Mansur’s
					court (which in itself illustrates the comparative openness and tolerance of the
					early Abbasids), and brought with them India’s relatively advanced
					mathematics, including the use of trigonometry to help solve algebraic
					equations. Crucially, the Hindu mathematicians also employed a decimal notation,
					which one of the members of the House of Wisdom, Al-Khwarizmi
					(c.780&ndash;830), adopted and described in <i class="calibre5">The Book of
						Addition and Subtraction According to Hindu Calculation</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">Furthermore, Al-Khwarizmi also explained a method of calculating the square

					astronomers drew from Ptolemy’s <i class="calibre5">Almagest</i>, adopting his view that the Earth was at the centre of
					the solar system, and that the planets rotated around it along the lines of
					eight spheres. They also learned from Hindu astronomers, translating and
					perfecting Indian <i class="calibre5">zij</i>, or tables of planetary
					positions, and continued to refine Ptolemy’s system, only occasionally
					(as in the work of the 10th-century astronomer al-Biruni) toying with a
					heliocentric system that had the sun at its centre. Their calculations were made
					simpler when in the mid-eighth century they adopted the astrolabe, an instrument
					in which the celestial sphere was projected onto a flat plane marked with
					latitude and longitude lines.</p><p class="calibre14">By the 13th century, Islamic astronomy was at its zenith, and in 1259 a great
					observatory was constructed at Maragha in eastern Iran. Here Nasr al-Din al-Tusi
					and his successors made fine adjustments to account for slight discrepancies in
					the orbit of the planets, assisted by mechanical clocks that enabled them to
					record their observations in fine detail. Muslim scholars made advances in many
					other areas, too, first building on the base of Greek manuscripts translated
					into Arabic, and then making their own discoveries. They did not accept the
					theories of the ancients uncritically: al-Haythem (died 1039) produced a key
					work, the <i class="calibre5">Book of Optics</i>, in which he
					speculated that sight was the result of light travelling from an object to the
					eye, rather than the other way around as Ptolemy had theorized. Arab physicians
					continued to make progress, combining their practical observations with
					theoretical analysis. Al-Razi (died 925) produced the first description of
					smallpox and measles, as well as compiling a medical compendium that began a
					tradition of such encyclopaedias, culminating in the <i class="calibre5">Canon of Medicine</i> by ibn Sina (who was known as Avicenna in the
					West). Composed around 1015, it included separate sections for diseases that are
					specific to one body part, and those that afflict the body as a whole.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-415"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000388.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><em class="calibre19"><strong class="calibre25">The Canon of Medicine</strong></em> by ibn Sina or Avicenna (980&ndash;1037) set the standard for

					ancient centres of learning such as Alexandria, but also brought the Muslim
					world to the fringes of Western Europe through the conquest of Spain (from 711)
					and Sicily (from 827). A tradition of Islamic learning embedded itself in both
					areas, and particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, known to the Arabs as
					al-Andalus. The court established there in 756 by Abd ar-Rahman I, a refugee
					Umayyad prince who had escaped the Abbasid revolution, became a magnet for
					scholars from the East, and its libraries became a repository of precious
					ancient texts that had been translated into Arabic.</p><p class="calibre14">In 967, the French cleric and scholar Gerbert of Aurillac (who in 999 would
					become Pope Sylvester II) arrived in Spain for a three-year period of study at a
					monastery in Catalonia. There he had access to manuscripts that had filtered
					over the border from Muslim-held al-Andalus. He took back to France knowledge of
					Arabic technology such as the water clock and the astrolabe, and of a type of
					abacus that used a decimal system. This was the first example of the
					system’s use in medieval Europe. It was a small beginning, and one
					paralleled in southern Italy where a medical school was established at Salerno
					in the 9th century. A few Islamic manuscripts reached the school in the early
					years, but many more arrived in the late 11th century when Muslim doctor
					Constantine the African returned from Qairawan in Tunisia. He had gone there to
					study medicine, and brought back with him works such as the <i class="calibre5">Complete Art of Medicine</i> by Ali ibn al-Abbas
					al-Majusi (known in the West as Haly Abbas), parts of which he then translated
					into Latin. This translation gave Western doctors and scholars access to
					comparatively advanced Muslim medical knowledge.</p><p class="calibre14">Classical Greek texts arrived directly from the Byzantine Empire to the West
					(in particular Pisa, which had a trading quarter in Constantinople), including
					works by the philosopher Aristotle. The main channel for the transmission of
					Islamic learning into Europe, however, continued to be Spain. As Islamic Spain
					shrank, pressurized by the Reconquista, the flow of materials accelerated. The
					Christian reconquest spread increasingly into Muslim emirates until, in 1085,
					Alfonso VI of Castile captured Toledo. The city became a centre for the
					translation of Arabic works by an international group including the Englishman
					Herbert of Ketton, Slav Hermann of Carinthia, the Frenchman Raymond of
					Marseilles, Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra, and Italian Gerhard of Cremona. In
					the mid-12th century, the group translated many Arabic texts into Latin,
					including works on mathematics, medicine, and philosophy. Western Europe now had
					access to Ptolemy’s <i class="calibre5">Almagest</i>, and to
					the medical works of Galen, as well as access to new works by Arabic writers who
					had built on or summarized the work of their ancient predecessors, such as ibn
					Sina’s <i class="calibre5">Canon of Medicine</i>. This
					five-book encyclopaedia became one of the most widely used treatises in European
					medical schools until the 16th century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-417"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000159.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The ancient Greek</span> thinker Aristotle

					Islamic world had absorbed Greek learning during the great period of translation
					into Arabic in the 9th and 10th centuries. Noble and royal patrons played
					similar roles in both phases of the transmission. King Roger II of Sicily (which
					by 1091 had been reconquered from the Muslims) invited Arab scholar al-Idrisi to
					his court in 1138 with a commission to construct a map of the world based on
					Islamic geographical and cartographic works. The result, which took more than 15
					years to complete, was by far the most accurate world map yet available to
					Europeans, and showed areas as far east as Korea. The map was accompanied by the
						<i class="calibre5">Book of Pleasant Journeys into Faraway
						Lands</i>, in which al-Idrisi’s royal patron could have read
					of wondrous things such as cannibals in Borneo, and the gold trade in
					Ghana.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-419"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"[Roger II of Sicily] is responsible for singular innovations and for

					continued his grandfather’s tradition of sponsoring translations of
					Arabic texts. A remarkable polymath who knew at least four languages, Roger so
					impressed his contemporaries with his learning that he became known as Stupor
					Mundi (“the Marvel of the World”). Among his
					protégés were the Scottish scholar Michael Scot, who translated
					key works of Aristotle on zoology, and the Pisan Leonardo Fibonacci, who had
					been sent by his merchant family to study mathematics at Bougie in Muslim North
					Africa. There Fibonacci learned of the decimal system, and in 1202 he published
					the <i class="calibre5">Book of Calculations</i>, the most detailed
					account yet seen in Europe of the Arabic system of numbering.</p><p class="calibre14">By the early 13th century, the Abbasid Empire had all but collapsed. The
					difficulties of ruling such a far-flung empire and the effects of a series of
					civil wars had led to key provinces such as Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt breaking
					away to be ruled by their own caliphs. Even in Baghdad, where the Abbasid
					caliphs clung on, they were only notionally sovereign. Real power was held by
					other dynasties such as the Shia Buyids, and, from 1055, the Seljuqs, a Turkish
					group originating in central Asia. The final blow was dealt by the Mongols, who
					surged westwards into the Islamic world in the early 13th century. In 1258, the
					Mongol Great Khan Möngke unleashed an army against Iraq, which laid siege
					to and then sacked Baghdad, inflicting an appalling massacre on its inhabitants.
					The last ruling Abbasid caliph al-Musta’sim was executed, and political
					and cultural leadership of the Islamic world passed first to the Mamluks in
					Cairo and then, after their conquest of Egypt in 1517, to the Ottoman
					Turks.</p><p class="calibre14">By this time Europeans had rediscovered Greek and Roman learning in almost
					every field of scholarship through the medium of Arabic texts. It had taken
					centuries for the new material to be absorbed, and a further wave of interest in
					classical manuscripts in the 15th century to spark the Renaissance in Europe.
					The House of Wisdom founded by the Abbasid caliphs had played a key role in
					ensuring the survival of Greek and Roman science in the Islamic world, allowing
					its transmission centuries later to Christian Europe.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-421"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000189.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Roger II invited</span> scholar al-Idrisi to

					became the most powerful city in the Islamic world, and flourished as a centre

					Harun based himself at Raqqa, closer to the frontiers of the Byzantine Empire,
					against which he launched a raid in 806, personally commanding an army of many

					Scandinavia, population growth may have forced young men into a piratical
					lifestyle; in others, perhaps the increasing strength of local clan leaders
					sparked power struggles that pushed the losers into exile. And the newly rich

					England &ndash; where they established a kingdom that lasted almost 100 years
					&ndash; and to occupy land in northern France, where their descendants became
					French-speaking Normans. In the east, Vikings traded and raided along
					Russia’s rivers, which brought them silver from the Islamic world and
					contact with the Byzantine Empire.</p><p class="calibre14">By the 11th century, most of the Scandinavian kingdoms had adopted
					Christianity, and turned from raiding and pillaging to more organized settlement
					and conquest. Cnut of Denmark created a Viking North Sea empire that included
					Denmark, Norway, and England. Yet it did not survive his death, and in 1066, an

				over the Christian church, and the authority to appoint &ndash; or invest &ndash;
				bishops.</p><p class="calibre14">Both king and pope were rulers of particular domains, but they also had rival
				symbolic claims to lead all Christendom. An emperor had to be crowned by the pope
				before he assumed the imperial title. Pope Gregory VII asserted that the
				pope’s authority was supreme in spiritual matters, and that even in secular
				affairs it stood far above that of worldly princes.</p><p class="calibre14">When at last Gregory signalled forgiveness of the penitent emperor, it marked a

It had failed to
					impose &ndash; or had lost &ndash; authority over national churches outside
					Italy, and monarchs were appointing their own bishops, especially in Germany
					where the office often came with considerable territorial domains. The feeling
					that the church had lost touch with its roots was also widespread: monasteries
					had become storehouses of treasure, bishops were ruling their lands like secular
					lords, and clerical offices were openly sold. Itinerant preachers started to
					inveigh against these betrayals, and calls for reform were beginning to be heard
					from within the church itself.</p><p class="calibre14">Gregory vigorously promoted papal authority, and in 1075 a church council
					declared that only the pope had the power to appoint bishops or move them to a
					different area. Henry, facing the loss of authority over large tracts of
					Germany, continued to appoint bishops and called for the pope to step down.
					Gregory retaliated by excommunicating the king and declaring him deposed. German
					nobles, already feeling discontented at Henry’s attempts to centralize
					power, felt that this released them from their oath of loyalty, and many rose up
					in revolt. Caught between the papacy and the nobles, Henry eventually chose to
					take the road to Canossa in a humiliating retreat.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-436"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000181.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Henry was refused entry</span> when at last

					explicitly settled and underlying dispute caused partisans of pope and emperor
					to clash repeatedly until 1122, when Henry’s son Henry V agreed to the
					Concordat of Worms. Squeezed between an increasingly assertive insistence on
					papal supremacy, and the growing independence of the German nobles, the emperor
					conceded virtually all investiture rights.</p><p class="calibre14">Energized by its success, the papal administration (or <i class="calibre5">curia</i>) consolidated. A growing thirst for education led to the
					foundation of universities such as that at Bologna where many students studied
					canon law. With rising confidence, popes ruthlessly persecuted heretics and
					swept away lax practices.</p><p class="calibre14">The reforms strengthened the church, whose diplomatic stature grew to equal
					that of any monarch, and it survived in a united form until the Reformation in
					the 16th century. The blow to the prestige of the Holy Roman Emperors was

					Bruno joined a group of hermits near Grenoble in 1084. Their way of life
					attracted others to found similar groups, which became the core of the
					Cistercian Order. The Carthusians, established in 1098, had by 1153 nearly 350
					houses, yet these enclosed orders did not fully answer the spiritual needs of a
					society that was becoming increasingly affluent, educated, and mobile. A new
					wave of mendicant friars appeared in the 13th century: committed to a life of
					poverty, they travelled and preached among the people. The Franciscans, founded
					in 1209 by Francis of Assisi, and the Dominicans, established in 1216 by Dominic

				military class, the samurai, and established a line of military rulers who would
				govern Japan for the next 750 years.</p><p class="calibre14">The Japanese imperial court had been dominated since the mid-7th century by
				regents from the Fujiwara family, who had reduced the emperors to mere figureheads.
				The situation became entrenched after the capital moved (following the emperor) to
				Kyoto in 794. Non-Fujiwara nobles were denied preferment at court, so sought
				positions in the provinces. The gulf widened between the Kyoto-based bureaucrats and
				the regional nobility, the samurai, who assumed a dominant role in local government.
				The Kyoto court appointed the most talented samurai as governors (<i class="calibre5">zuryo</i>), both to bind them to the imperial government
				and to prevent them from building their own power bases. However the samurai
				developed loyalty to their extended family, or clan, and its leader rather than to
				the emperor, and fought one another from their power bases in the provinces. The
				Minamoto and Taira clans engaged in a series of these struggles which culminated in
				the Gempei War, during which the Taira were utterly crushed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-442"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000109.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-443" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The shogunate</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Following his victory, clan leader Minamoto Yoritomo established a parallel

					chieftains became his vassals or <i class="calibre5">gokenin</i>, and
					he despatched military estate governors to cement his control over the
					provinces. In 1192, Yoritomo accepted from the emperor the title of shogun,
					becoming the de facto military ruler of Japan.</p><p class="calibre14">Over the following centuries the emperors made periodic vain attempts to
					reassert authority over the shogunate, but the shoguns in turn could not
					maintain control of the samurai and their warlords, who controlled their areas
					and fought among themselves. Japan dissolved into a patchwork of military
					warlords or <i class="calibre5">daimyo</i>, each with its own power
					base and retinue of samurai warriors.</p><p class="calibre14">Establishment of the office of shogun, which had seemed to offer Japan

				seemed ineffectual. However, its assertion of the rights of subjects against
				arbitrary actions of the Crown &ndash; the essential principle of the rule of law
				&ndash; provided a blueprint which, more than eight centuries later, is still
				viewed as a fundamental guarantee of rights in the UK and elsewhere.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-449"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000393.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-450" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Feudal society</h2></div><p class="calibre15">When King John acceded in 1199, England was a feudal society, a land-based
					hierarchy headed by the king, who owned all the land. The tenants-in-chief (or
					barons) received land from the king in exchange for loyalty and military
					service. They in turn leased the land to their own armed retainers, who leased
					to peasants, or villeins. Yet monarchs, especially in England, were levying an
					ever-increasing series of taxes and additional financial burdens on their
					barons. English kings from Henry I (1100&ndash;1135) onwards also sought to
					centralize administration, partly by establishing a series of royal courts.
					These royal courts raised revenue for the Crown through fines and charges
					&ndash; but at the expense of the barons, who had previously raised those funds
					from their own local tribunals.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-451" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The exactions of King John</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The barons’ discontent at these growing demands intensified under King
					John. Ruinously expensive campaigns against the French in 1200&ndash;04 had
					already resulted in the loss of Normandy (and earned the king the mocking
					nickname “Lackland”). Scutage, a further cash levy that left many
					barons in debt to money-lenders, was bitterly resented. Not only was the king
					proving lamentably unsuccessful in war, but he had also broken the unspoken
					contract between himself and the barons, that allowed them to run their lands as
					they chose.</p><p class="calibre14">Hoping for support from the pope, who had excommunicated John in 1209, the
					rebellious barons confronted the king. Attempts at diplomacy failed, and by May
					1215 the barons had occupied London, forcing John to enter into a treaty with
					them to avoid a civil war. After careful direction of negotiations by Archbishop
					Stephen Langton of Canterbury, the agreement &ndash; more a truce than a peace
					&ndash; was signed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-452"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000042.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Magna Carta</span> included clauses

					from a more restricted Forest Charter issued in 1217. Much of the Magna Carta
					dealt with redressing baronial grievances, but the section that has exerted the
					most influence down the ages was Chapter 39. This open-ended clause protected
					all “free men” from arbitrary actions by the Crown such as arrest,
					or confiscation of land. The charter survived the civil war that broke out soon
					after the Magna Carta was agreed, and the papal repudiation of the
					charter’s terms in August 1215, which led to the barons’
					excommunication. Chapter 39 was extended under a 1354 law of Edward III to
					protect not only “free men” (a small minority in England where
					most people were technically serfs), but also any man “of whatever estate
					or condition he may be”. It survived longer than most of the other
					provisions, including the security clause that allowed barons to seize all the
					king’s land if he failed to fulfil his obligations under the
					agreement.</p><p class="calibre14">What had seemed a small concession that day in Runnymede provided a
					long-lasting rallying cry for opponents of royal tyranny.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature10" id="calibre_link-454"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Influence of the Magna Carta</h4><p class="intro">The Magna Carta has acquired an almost mythical status as the constitutional
					bedrock of subjects’ rights. It contributed to the development of
					parliament from the 13th century, and was used by 17th-century rebels to argue
					against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs Charles I
					and James II. Several American colonies’ charters contained clauses
					modelled on it, while the design of the Massachusetts seal chosen at the start
					of the Revolutionary War depicts a militiaman with sword in one hand and the
					Magna Carta in the other. Revolutionary feeling was fuelled by Americans’
					belief that the Crown had breached the fundamental law enjoyed by all English
					subjects, and both the United States Constitution, enacted in 1789, and the Bill
					of Rights adopted two years later, were influenced by the Magna Carta’s
					limitations on the arbitrary powers of a government against its subjects.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre3">The fall of Jerusalem</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-161" class="calibre3">The Norman conquest of England</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-121" class="calibre3">The Battle of Castillon</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre3">The execution of Charles I</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre3">The signing of the Declaration of

					Khan &ndash; proclaimed himself the ruler of a united Mongol nation. Shrewd and
					ruthless, Genghis diverted his people from inter-clan warfare and directed their
					energies to the more lucrative business of invading &ndash; first neighbouring
					tribes in the steppes, then more organized states such as Persia, Russia, and
					northern China (1219&ndash;23). He gave the Mongol hordes a proper military
					structure and exploited the skills they had learnt from their nomadic lifestyle:
					as expert horsemen, the soldiers were masters of mobile warfare and able to
					descend with devastating force and lightning speed on their opponents.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-459"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000345.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Paper money</span> was invented by the Chinese

					challenges of mediating between the nomadic traditions of the Mongols and the
					complex culture of the conquered proved difficult. The old informal hierarchies
					of the steppes no longer sufficed to administer a land that contained great
					cities, and the immediate rewards of plunder were replaced by the deferred
					benefits gained by good governance and taxation. As a result, many Mongols
					missed the old ways. To appease his fellow Mongols, Kublai gave them greater
					rights and privileges than the native Chinese. Meanwhile, to gain favour with
					the traditional Chinese elites, he promoted Confucian scholars, funded Taoist
					temples, and had his son educated in Buddhist scripture. He also set up schools
					for peasants and introduced the Mongol postal system of using horses and relay
					stations to link up the empire, which benefited the merchants.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-461" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The end of the empire</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The need to restore stability in northern China delayed Kublai’s
					attempts to subjugate the Song in the south until 1268. Although ultimately
					successful, the 11-year campaign was ruinously costly. To preserve their warrior
					identity, the Mongols needed the spoils of conquest to fund their huge army.
					Kublai’s successors failed to work out how to preserve their identity
					while also keeping their monopoly of power, and the Mongol military gradually
					declined. After decades of famine, lethal epidemics, and corruption at court, in
					1368 the heirs of Kublai were defeated in a rebellion led by Zhu Yuanzhang,
					founder of the Ming dynasty. After more than a century of occupation, China was
					back in the hands of the native (Han) Chinese.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-462"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">KUBLAI KHAN<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-463"><img alt="" src="images/000325.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan (1215&ndash;94) governed northern China

					displeased many Mongols and he was nearly removed in 1258, but
					Möngke’s death led to Kublai achieving the position of Great Khan
					himself in 1260. Kublai established a bureaucracy staffed largely by Chinese
					officials, but he placed Mongol officers (<i class="calibre5">darughachi</i>) in key towns to ensure loyalty to the empire. He
					took measures to restore the economy, initially encouraged religious tolerance,
					and welcomed foreigners such as Marco Polo to the Mongol court, aware of the
					expertise they might bring. After the successes in China, Kublai despatched
					armies to Japan, Annam (Vietnam), Myanmar (Burma), and Java; however, these

				travelled from Italy to the Mongol capital Shangdu along the length of the Silk
				Road, an ancient network of routes that had been carrying precious goods between China
				and Europe for centuries. The Silk Road had first become a conduit for trade when
				the Chinese Han Dynasty pushed into Central Asia in the late 2nd century BCE. From
				then on, goods such as jade and silk were carried west, passed from caravan to
				caravan by a series of merchants, to be met by caravans of furs, gold, and horses
				travelling in the opposite direction. Chinese inventions ranging from gunpowder and
				paper to the magnetic compass were also brought to the west along the route,
				arriving at Constantinople and the Black Sea ports, the western end of the route
				where Genoa and Venice chiefly traded.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-466"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000242.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-467" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Mongol revival of the route</h2></div><p class="calibre15">By the 13th century, empires that had controlled sections of the Silk Road had
					fragmented. This left the route less secure for travellers, and so deterred
					merchants from using it. However, following Mongol conquest of the area between
					1205 and 1269, the area was controlled &ndash; if loosely &ndash; by a single
					authority, the Great Khan, so a merchant could travel from Khanbalik (Beijing)
					to Baghdad without leaving Mongol territory. This renewed stability encouraged a
					revival of trade.</p><p class="calibre14">At around this time, European merchants’ horizons were also expanding.
					In the early Middle Ages, traders could work only locally, and transport their
					goods to points where they might connect to longer-distance trade routes. From
					the 12th century, Italian city States such as Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, pioneered
					maritime trade across the eastern Mediterranean, which enabled merchants to
					connect directly with sea routes that linked West Asia and Egypt to China via
					the Indian Ocean.</p><p class="calibre14">The profits for merchants taking advantage of the “Pax
					Mongolica”, or Mongol peace, could be huge. In the late 13th century, the
					costs of setting up a caravan might amount to 3,500 florins, but the cargo, once
					sold in China, could yield seven times that sum, and by 1326 Genoese traders
					were a common sight in the principal Chinese port of Zaitun.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-468"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"All the rare things that come from India are brought to Cambaluc &ndash;

					growth of the Muslim Ottoman Empire.</p><p class="calibre14">A taste of the profits of long-distance trade in luxury goods encouraged
					European powers to seek alternatives to the now defunct Silk Road, this time by

					both.</p><p class="calibre14">In the 11th century, however, the advances of a new group, the Seljuk Turks,
					disrupted the pilgrimage routes to Jerusalem, and the Turks’ defeat of
					the Byzantines at Manzikert threatened to push the frontiers of Christianity
					back to the gates of Constantinople. In 1095, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent

					calling for an expedition to free them. Christian warriors rallied to the cause,
					eager to gain both salvation and plunder by joining a so-called Just War in
					God’s name.</p><p class="calibre14">Some 100,000 crusading knights, mostly French and Norman, set out in 1096.
					Progress to Jerusalem was slow: the crusaders suffered several setbacks at the
					hands of the Seljuk Turks, and the long siege of Antioch severely tested their
					morale, yet they pressed on and, led by the French knight Godfrey of Bouillon,
					at last captured the Holy City.</p><p class="calibre14">In the area they had conquered the crusaders established four states, at
					Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, known collectively as
					Outremer. To withstand the vigorous Muslim counter-attacks, the crusaders built
					a dense network of fortresses such as Beaufort, Margat, and Krak des Chevaliers
					which dominated strategic routes into the Holy Land.</p><p class="calibre14">As the initial crusading impulse waned, Outremer began to suffer from a
					shortage of manpower. This was partly resolved by the founding of crusading
					orders such as the Templars and Hospitallar knights, organizations who swore
					monastic vows to defend the Holy Land.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-477"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000163.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Victorious crusaders</span> flooded into

					at an even higher level, as monarchs such as Louis VIII of France, Richard I of
					England, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa assumed their
					leadership.</p><p class="calibre14">By 1270 there had been eight further crusades, and the movement had extended
					to include attacks on Muslims in North Africa; joining the Reconquista (the
					Christian reconquest of Islamic emirates in Spain); launching expeditions

					Cathars in southern France. In the Middle East, however, the emergence of

				impressive urban complex with residential areas, temples, and a network of water
				reservoirs, built by a succession of god-kings who ruled as the earthly
				representatives of the Hindu god Shiva.</p><p class="calibre14">Around 1120, the Khmer king Suryavarman II commissioned an ambitious new
				construction project &ndash; a 200-hectare (500-acre) temple complex dedicated to
				the Hindu god Vishnu that would also record the king’s achievements. His
				spectacular Angkor Wat, completed 37 years later, was enclosed by a huge moat,
				adorned with lotus-shaped towers, and decorated with an 800m-long (2,600ft) gallery
				of fine bas-reliefs depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and the king as the
				embodiment of Vishnu.</p><p class="calibre14">Angkor Wat is a testament to the remarkable productivity and creativity of one of
				the greatest powers in Southeast Asia’s history, yet its construction also
				marked the onset of its decline, as later kings faced foreign invasions, shifts in
				trade, and wars with rival kingdoms that shrunk its territory. The empire’s
				fortunes were revived under Jayavarman VII, who made Mahyanana Buddhism the state
				religion, and initiated a building spree at Angkor, but his death in 1218 left it
				fatally weakened.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-482"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"Buddhas decorate all the immense columns and lintels."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Zhou Daguan <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">Chinese diplomat</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div id="calibre_link-483" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Outside influences</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Khmer Empire was preeminent among the powerful states that had emerged in

					towards the end of the first millennium CE. During the states’ formation,
					their societies had been profoundly affected by contact with India and China,
					made via the major trade route that ran through the Bay of Bengal, then overland
					across the Malay Peninsula before resuming through the Gulf of Thailand and on
					to the south of China. As well as enabling the exchange of Southeast Asian
					commodities such as rare woods, ivory, and gold, this network introduced Indian
					and Chinese ideas, concepts, and practices &ndash; such as Hinduism and
					Buddhism &ndash; to the region’s civilizations, which adapted them to
					create original, indigenous variations, particularly in architecture and the

					archipelago, the empire of Srivijaya, based in Palembang in Sumatra, dominated
					commerce by controlling the two passages between India and China &ndash; the
					straits of Malacca and Sunda. Over time, it had grown rich from its trade in the
					spices, especially nutmeg, that Europe, India, and China craved, but by the end
					of the 12th century it had been reduced to a small kingdom, and was later
					eclipsed by the Majapahit in Java.</p><p class="calibre14">In the late 13th century, Mongol forces under the Chinese emperor Kublai Khan
					invaded Vietnam, Java, and Myanmar, and although these campaigns failed, in
					their wake, the Khmer lost control of eastern Thailand. In the early 1400s, the
					empire contracted further as armies from Champa (now in Vietnam) and Ayutthaya
					(now in Thailand) &ndash; seized more of its land. In 1431, the latter took
					Angkor, and the capital was later relocated to the coast, leaving
					Suryavarman’s spiritual masterpiece to be reclaimed by the jungle.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-486"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">SURYAVARMAN II<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-487"><img alt="" src="images/000071.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">One of the Khmer Empire’s greatest kings, Suryavarman II ascended to
					the throne in 1113, after killing his rival, and reunited Cambodia after decades
					of unrest. He quickly resumed diplomatic relations with China, and in 1128 his
					kingdom was recognized as a Chinese vassal, which helped deter neighbouring
					states from attacking it. Suryavarman was a warlike leader, waging campaigns in
					what is now Vietnam against the Dai-Viet between 1123 and 1136, and against the
					Khmer’s traditional enemy to the east, Champa, in 1145. He also pushed
					the empire’s boundaries deep into Thailand and made advances against the
					Pagan kingdom of Myanmar.</p><p class="calibre11">As well as the awe-inspiring Angkor Wat, which remains the largest religious
					structure in the world, the king also built other temples in the same style at
					the capital. His political and military achievements were less enduring, however
					&ndash; when he died in 1150, in the middle of a campaign against Champa, the

					Ghana, which became known as “the land of gold”, a reference to
					the source of its huge wealth. In the 7th century, the Arab conquest of North
					Africa gave a new impetus to trans-Saharan trade &ndash; the Muslim states had
					a huge appetite for West African gold and slaves. As this trade grew, Muslim
					merchants, and with them Islam, were drawn to the area between the headwaters of
					the Niger and Senegal rivers.</p><p class="calibre14">However, peaceful trading was soon followed by conquest. The Almoravids, a
					Moroccan Berber dynasty, swept south in 1076 and sacked Ghana’s capital,
					shattering its authority over the region.</p><p class="calibre14">Ghana’s reduced power opened up a vacuum that was gradually filled by
					Mali, a state founded around the Upper Niger River, which began to expand in the
					mid-13th century. Under Mansa Musa (ruled 1312&ndash;37), Mali reached its
					greatest extent and power, having forged lucrative caravan connections with
					Egypt and other important trade centres in North Africa. Gold, salt, and slaves

					wealth.</p><p class="calibre14">The expedition had a purpose beyond advertising Mali’s prestige
					however, as the king invited Muslim scholars and a great architect, Abu Ishaq
					al-Sahili, to make the return journey with him. The latter built West
					Africa’s first mud-brick mosques at Timbuktu and Gao, trading posts
					recently captured from the neighbouring Songhai. Under Mansa Musa’s
					guidance, Timbuktu became Mali’s main commercial hub &ndash; boosted by
					its advantageous location at the junction of the desert trade and the maritime
					routes down the Niger &ndash;and began its rise as the region’s

For
					the next 100 years they eked out a miserable existence as mercenaries or barely
					tolerated squatters, their plight not aided by their reputation as cruel
					warriors. Frequently, they had to flee after committing violent acts, at times
					involving human sacrifice; indeed, their flight to Tenochtitlan was prompted by
					one such incident. The Aztecs had asked their host, the lord of
					Culhuacán, whether he would give his daughter as a bride for their chief.
					He agreed, believing she would be greatly honoured as queen; however, to his
					horror they killed and flayed her as a sacrifice to their deity Xipe Totec.
					Driven out by the lord and his soldiers, the Aztecs fled southwards towards the
					future site of Tenochtitlan.</p><p class="calibre14">Although the soil around Lake Texcoco, on which the island of Tenochtitlan was
					situated, was marshy and there was very little timber available, the capital was
					easily defensible and the Aztecs used it to consolidate their position.
					Initially shielded by a treaty with the Tepanec ruler Tezozomoc, who dominated
					the Valley of Mexico from 1371 to 1426, the Aztecs went on to form a Triple
					Alliance with the cities of Texcoco and Tlacopan in 1428 &ndash; a union that
					kick-started a period of imperial expansion.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-499" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Aztec expansion</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In the early days, Aztec society had little formal hierarchy. It was based
					around communities (<i class="calibre5">calpulli</i>), which owned
					land in common and whose chiefs, together with priests, ruled on important
					decisions. In 1376, the Aztecs chose for the first time an overall leader
						(<i class="calibre5">tlatoani</i>), who came to serve as war
					leader, judge, and administrator for the burgeoning empire. Under Itzcoatl
					(1427&ndash;40), Moctezuma I (1440&ndash;69), Axayactl (1469&ndash;81), and
					Ahuitzotl (1486&ndash;1503) Aztec armies subdued their neighbours in the Valley
					of Mexico and then spread outwards, reaching Oaxaca, Veracruz, and to the edges
					of land controlled by the Mayan people in the east of modern-day Mexico and
					Guatemala.</p><p class="calibre14">As the Aztec Empire expanded, society was transformed. A warrior elite
					emerged, while at the bottom of society bondsmen (<i class="calibre5">mayeques</i>), who owned no land, were bound by labour service to
					their lords. The militaristic nature of Aztec society was accentuated by an
					education system in which all males received military training (in separate
					schools for nobles and commoners). This reinforced the warrior ethos and gave
					the Aztecs an incalculable advantage over neighbouring tribes in Mexico.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-500" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The imperial system</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Tenochtitlan was adorned by many temples to the gods of the Aztec pantheon.
					Each god had their own temple, with the Templo Mayor having twin shrines
					dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, the rain god. At these temples a stream
					of human victims was sacrificed &ndash; up to 80,000 at the rededication of the
					Templo Mayor in 1487 &ndash; by burning alive, decapitation, or cutting open
					the chest and removing the heart.</p><p class="calibre14">Many of the Aztec battles were “flower wars”: ritual affairs in
					which opponents were captured (rather than killed) and sacrificed to placate the
					Aztec gods, who were believed to need blood to sustain them and keep the sun
					moving across the sky.</p><p class="calibre14">Tenochtitlan also exacted tribute from its subjects. Although there was very
					little in the way of an organized government bureaucracy, there were tax
					collectors, who criss-crossed the 38 provinces of the Aztec Empire and levied
					tribute, which included 7,000 tons of maize, 4,000 tons of beans, and hundreds
					of thousands of cotton blankets each year. The empire depended on this tribute
					to reward the nobility and the warriors, who ensured that the towns subjugated
					by the Aztecs remained submissive &ndash; little mercy being shown to those who
					revolted.</p><p class="calibre14">While the Aztecs provided some security to their subjects, they gave little
					else. At Tenochtitlan, artificial islands (<i class="calibre5">chinampas</i>) were created at great expense to expand the land
					available to produce food, but no such works were carried out for the subject
					cities. Defeated states did not provide troops for the Aztec army, and so did
					not share in the spoils of future victory, and little effort was made to
					propagate the Aztec language. It was an empire built on fear and in the end it
					proved brittle: when it was invaded by a small party of Spaniards led by Cortes
					in 1519, the subject peoples rallied to the newcomers rather than defending the
					Aztecs, and the empire collapsed within two years.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-501"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000330.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The founding</span> of Tenochtitlan is

					modern-day Peru, had similarly humble origins to the Aztecs, but their rise to
					imperial status was, if anything, even more meteoric. They began as a small,
					somewhat disregarded tribe and developed their own strategies to co-opt
					neighbouring groups into a successful empire.</p><p class="calibre14">The Incas’ origin myth told of their emergence from a cave in the high
					mountains, from where their first leader &ndash; Manco Capac &ndash; led his
					people to Cuzco. It is generally believed that the Incas arrived in the region
					around 1200, and for two centuries they remained a relatively insignificant
					farming group, with their society divided up into clans (<i class="calibre5">ayllus</i>) of roughly equal status.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-503" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Inca expansion</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Incas began to make their mark as a major power around 1438, when the
					neighbouring Chanca people attempted to push the Incas out of the Cuzco valley.
					By this time, the Incas had a supreme leader (the Sapa Inca), and although the
					incumbent Viracocha was unequal to the task, his son Pachacuti defeated the
					invaders, and then led Inca armies to conquer the rest of the Cuzco valley and
					the southern highlands around Lake Titicaca. Under Pachacuti’s son Topa
					Inca Yupanqui and grandson Huayna Capac, the Incas overcame Chimor (the largest
					coastal state) in about 1470. They then absorbed the rest of the northern
					highlands and extended to parts of modern-day Ecuador and Colombia and south to
					the deserts north of Chile.</p><p class="calibre14">Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas recruited troops from among the conquered peoples
					(placed under the command of Inca officers), thus providing them with the lure
					of plunder in return for their loyalty.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-504"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"If the land [Peru] had not been divided by the wars… we could not

					of peasants, who all owed labour service (<i class="calibre5">mitad</i>) to the Sapa Inca. This level of organization enabled the
					construction of public works on a vast scale. Particularly vital was the
					extensive road network, which extended 40,000 kilometres (nearly 25,000 miles)
					long and was dotted at regular intervals with resthouses that facilitated rapid
					transit for the army and provided a very efficient system of communication
					across the far-flung Inca domains. At the same time, the Inca domestication of
					the llama as a beast of burden made it easier to transport heavy loads across
					the empire.</p><p class="calibre14">Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas actively sought to spread their own language
					(Quechua) and system of religious beliefs, which was initially based around the
					worship of Inti (the sun god), but which came to feature prominently Viracocha
					&ndash; a supreme creation god and therefore considered a more suitable deity
					for a conquering power. They also despatched colonists (<i class="calibre5">miqmaq</i>), shifting troublesome groups into more pacified areas to
					dilute their resistance and creating networks of loyal settlers on the fringes
					of the empire. Although definitive population statistics are not known, by the
					early 16th century the Inca Empire &ndash; which the Incas called Tawintusuyu
					(“The Realm of Four Quarters”) &ndash; consisted of about
					4&ndash;6 million people in total, operating to the advantage of the Inca
					minority and their subjects.</p><p class="calibre14">Despite its many strengths, the highly centralized nature of the Inca Empire
					proved fatal in the early 1530s, when Spanish invaders led by Pizarro captured
					the Sapa Inca Atahuallpa; without their leader, the Incas rapidly
					collapsed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-506"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000023.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Society in</span> the expansionist Aztec

					Americas. They were able to do so by creating food surpluses through irrigation
					projects, thus releasing a large proportion of their population to fight in the
					armies that conducted their campaigns of expansion. They also reorganized the
					traditional tribal structure to favour a warrior and noble elite. In both cases,
					the momentum of conquest demanded further wars to reward the warrior caste or to
					provide an incentive for newly conquered peoples to remain loyal and thus to
					gain the rewards of participation in new campaigns.</p><p class="calibre14">Neither the Aztecs nor the Incas survived long enough to govern after their
					expansion slowed down. Had they done so, they might have developed strategies to
					bring long-term stability to their empires, or might have declined to the status
					of competing city-states fighting to control limited resources. Instead, the
					Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in 1521 and their defeat of the last Incas by
					1572 put paid to the ambitions of both empires and left the Spanish firmly
					established as colonial rulers in the region for the next 300 years.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-508"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"They cut open their chests, drew out the palpitating hearts and offered

					introduced the new post of chief adviser (<i class="calibre5">cihuacoatl</i>). The office’s first incumbent was
					Itzcoatl’s nephew, Tlacaelel (1397&ndash;1487), who held the office
					until his death. Tlacaelel served through several reigns and he provided
					invaluable continuity. In addition, he created impetus for his reforms (mostly
					benefiting the royal family and nobles) by ordering the destruction of earlier
					chronicles and the rewriting of Aztec history to establish the basis of Aztec
					imperial ideology.</p><p class="calibre11">He also presided over the formation of the Triple Alliance, solidifying the
					Aztec position and ensuring a steady stream of sacrificial victims. Given that
					Tlacaelel was never the Aztec’s ruler, his immense influence in

					plague’s initial progress westwards was slow, but after it reached Crimea
					and Constantinople in 1347 it spread rapidly along maritime trade routes. Having
					hit Genoa, it appeared quickly in Sicily and Marseilles; by 1348 it had struck
					Spain, Portugal, and England, and it reached Germany and Scandinavia by
					1349.</p><p class="calibre14">The epidemic’s main vector was infected fleas and the rats that
					harboured them, both of which flourished in the unsanitary conditions of the
					time. The main symptoms of the disease were swellings, known as buboes, that
					appeared in the groin, neck, or armpits. These were followed by black blotches
					on the skin (hence “Black Death”) and then, in around
					three-quarters of cases, by death.</p><p class="calibre14">Contemporaries ascribed the causes of the pestilence variously to divine
					punishment for immorality, adverse conjunctions of the planets, earthquakes, or
					bad vapours. There was no cure, but preventive advice included abstinence from
					hard-to-digest food, the use of aromatic herbs to purify the air, and &ndash;
					the only effective measure &ndash; avoiding the company of others.</p><p class="calibre14">More than a hundred million people may have died of the plague; estimates put
					the world population at 450 million before it arrived, and 350 million
					afterwards. Its effects were more deadly in some areas than in others &ndash;
					in Egypt, about 40 per cent of the population are thought to have died.
					Populations did not reach pre-plague levels again for nearly three
					centuries.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-514"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000247.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-515" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Reactions to the plague</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Survivors reacted in varying ways. Jewish communities in Germany were accused
					of causing the plague by poisoning wells, and many were attacked. In Strasbourg
					alone 2,000 Jews were killed.</p><p class="calibre14">With the population diminished, landholdings fell vacant, labour became
					scarce, and peasants’ bargaining power increased. By 1350, English
					labourers could demand five times the wages they had asked in 1347, and tenants
					were paying rent in cash rather than with compulsory labour. Governments tried
					to clamp down on wages &ndash; the 1351 Statute of Labourers aimed to freeze
					rates at 1346 levels &ndash; but peasants responded with outbursts such as the
					Jacquerie in France in 1358, and the Peasants’ Revolt in England in
					1381.</p><p class="calibre14">By the time it ended, the Black Death had killed proportionately as many
					clergy as laity, and some clergy deserted their posts. As a result the
					church’s authority, like that of the nobility, was greatly weakened. The
					plague had loosened the ties that had previously bound medieval society
					together, leaving a freer and more volatile population to face the challenges
					posed by the Renaissance, Reformation, and the economic expansion of the 16th

					hospitals in particular &ndash; rose as the rich gave thanks for their
					survival. Artistic production tended to the morbid: depictions of the Dance of
					Death appeared, showing Death cavorting among the living; and writers such as

					the Yuan. In the 1340s and 50s, factionalism in the Mongol court, rampant
					government corruption, and a series of natural disasters, including plagues and
					epidemics, resulted in wholesale breakdown in law and order and administration
					as peasant groups rose up against their faltering foreign overlords. Zhu himself
					lost most of his family in an outbreak of plague in 1344, and after a few years
					spent as a mendicant monk, begging for food, he joined the Red Turbans, one of a
					constellation of native Han Chinese peasant secret societies in rebellion
					against the Yuan. Determined, ruthless, and an able general, the young rebel
					climbed the ranks to the leadership of the Red Turbans, and later overcame his
					rivals to become the national leader against the Yuan.</p><p class="calibre14">Zhu took control of much of southern and northern China and declared himself
					emperor before pushing the Mongols out of their capital at Dadu (Beijing) in
					1368. The rest of the country was then subdued, although the Mongols resisted in
					the far north until the early 1370s, and the unification of China was not
					achieved until the defeat of the last Mongol forces in the south in 1382.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-522" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Reform and despotism</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Zhu’s first priority as emperor Hongwu was to establish order &ndash;
					decades of conflict had ravaged China and impoverished its rural population. His
					humble beginnings may have influenced some of his early policies: responsibility
					for tax assessment was entrusted to rural communities, sweeping away the problem
					of rapacious tax collectors who had preyed on poorer areas; slavery was
					abolished; many large estates were confiscated; and lands owned by the state in
					the under-populated north of the country were handed to landless peasants, to
					encourage them to settle there.</p><p class="calibre14">From 1380, Hongwu instituted government reforms that gave him personal control
					over all matters of state. After executing his prime minister, who had been
					implicated in a plot to overthrow him, he abolished the prime ministership and
					the central secretariat and had the heads of the next layer of government, the
					six ministries, report directly to him, ensuring he oversaw even minor
					decisions.</p><p class="calibre14">From then on, Hongwu acted as his own prime minister. His workload was almost
					unbearable &ndash; in a single week-long stint, he had to scrutinize and
					approve some 1,600 documents &ndash; and as a result, the state became
					incapable of responding swiftly to crises. Although in time a new grand
					secretariat emerged &ndash; an advisory board through which the emperor
					responded to the six ministries and other government agencies &ndash; the Ming
					retained a more autocratic and highly centralized structure than that of
					previous Chinese dynasties. This was reflected in the protocol of the Ming
					court, too: under the Song dynasty (960&ndash;1279), the emperor’s
					advisers had stood before him to discuss matters of state, but under the Ming
					they were required to <i class="calibre5">kowtow</i> &ndash; kneel
					and knock their heads to the floor &ndash; before him, a reverential
					acknowledgment of his absolute power and superiority.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-523"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000142.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The tribulations of Hongwu’s</span>

					competing power bases outside the central court, and in a bid to avoid this
					scenario, Hongwu diluted the strength of the army. Although he adopted the Yuan
					military system &ndash; establishing garrisons in key cities, particularly
					along the northern frontier, where the threat of nomad incursions was
					ever-present, and creating a hereditary caste of soldiers that supported itself
					on land granted by the government &ndash; he also ensured that military units
					were periodically rotated through the capital for training, and that a group of
					centrally selected officers shared authority in the army with the garrison
					commanders, thus preventing the rise of influential warlords with a strong local
					base.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-525"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000120.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Forbidden City</span> &ndash; the

					the heart of government for centuries. However, he was aware that they played a
					vital role in the efficient running of the state, and so he promoted education
					and trained scholars specifically for the bureaucracy. In 1373, he suspended the
					traditional examinations used to recruit civil servants and ordered the
					establishment of local county and prefectural schools. From these, the best
					candidates would be called for further study at a national university in the
					capital, where eventually 10,000 students from the original intake were
					enrolled. The civil service examinations were restored in 1385, when the emperor
					considered the well-trained graduates of the university ready to take them, and
					were so competitive that soldiers were stationed outside the cubicles where the
					examinees sat to avoid any collaboration or illicit use of reference
					materials.</p><p class="calibre14">The pool of potential recruits into the administration was thus widened, but
					civil servants still received a very conservative education based on the Four
					Books and Five Classics of Confucianism and a selection of neo-Confucian works
					that expounded the virtues of loyalty to the emperor and adherence to Chinese
					tradition. Innovation was discouraged and bureaucrats became set in their ways.
					Those who were perceived as having stepped outside their brief were publicly
					flogged, sometimes to death.</p><p class="calibre14">This maltreatment of public servants was a sign of the cruel side of
					Hongwu’s personality. He was also violently paranoid, and vicious in his
					suppression of dissent. In 1382, he established a secret police, the Embroidered
					Brocade Guard, whose 16,000 officers stamped out all signs of resistance. The
					Guard’s reach and influence was wide, and as a result, until the very
					last years of its rule, the Ming dynasty experienced no significant rebellions
					by either the military or the aristocracy.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-527"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Some people in the morning are esteemed [by the Hongwu emperor], and in

					Hongwu’s successor, Yongle (reigned 1402&ndash;24), who moved the
					capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and embarked on an ambitious programme of
					reconstruction and public works, including measures to improve the navigability
					of the Grand Canal. He also built the extravagant Forbidden City, which housed
					an imperial palace complex containing more than 9,000 rooms.</p><p class="calibre14">Yongle’s initially aggressive foreign policy led to four campaigns
					against Mongolia and an attack on Annam (Vietnam) in 1417 that resulted in its
					incorporation into the Ming Empire. He also sought recognition from the rulers
					of faraway states: between 1405 and 1433, he launched six large-scale maritime
					expeditions to Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Arabia. Led by the great fleet
					admiral Zheng He, their purpose was to confirm China’s domination over
					the area by exacting tribute and other gestures of homage to the emperor.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-529" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The later Ming</h2></div><p class="calibre15">However, the enormous cost of Zheng He’s ambitious ventures put great
					strain on the treasury, and to ensure they would never be repeated, all records
					relating to them were destroyed. Official ideology regarded China as the centre
					of the world, and the later Ming saw no reason to encourage further maritime
					contact. The Chinese did not regard relations with foreign powers as possible on
					an equal basis: where diplomatic relations were conducted, the foreigners were
					considered (by the Ming, at least) as tributaries. The confidence and stability
					of the Ming bureaucracy also created a sense of self-sufficiency, with little
					use for external influences.</p><p class="calibre14">Ocean-going vessels were made to report all the cargo they landed, and private
					maritime trade was periodically banned (until it was legalized again in 1567 for
					all except trade with Japan). In Beijing, a shopkeeper’s unauthorized
					contact with foreigners could result in the confiscation of his stock.
					Diplomatic isolation was reinforced by military uncertainty: Annam became
					independent once more in 1428, while huge resources were devoted to containing
					the threat posed by the Mongol tribes on China’s northern borders. In
					1449, Emperor Zhengtong personally led a disastrous expedition against the
					Mongol leader Esen Khan in which the majority of the 500,000 Chinese soldiers
					died of hunger, were picked off by the enemy, or perished in a final battle as
					they retreated.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-530"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000074.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Hongwu’s final resting place</span>,

					begun by the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BCE &ndash; was not only a bid to
					prevent a similar disaster, but also to compensate for the Ming’s waning
					energy. Like their predecessors, they were unable to absorb the lands of the
					nomadic groups to the north of the border, or to send out expeditions that had
					any lasting effect on discouraging their raids. Therefore, a fixed, strongly
					garrisoned border defence was the best compromise.</p><p class="calibre14">During the 16th century, a succession of short-lived emperors who were
					dominated by their consorts, mothers, or by eunuch (castrated) advisers, was
					capped by the long reign of Wanli (1573&ndash;1620), who simply withdrew from
					public life entirely: for the last decades of his reign, he refused even to meet
					with his ministers. The dynasty began to decline: the machinery of government
					faltered and the army had little strength to respond to the serious threat posed
					by the Jurchen in Manchuria (now in northeast China). In 1619, this tribal
					people, who later renamed themselves Manchu, began to encroach on China’s
					northern borders.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-532" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Global trade</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Economically, however, Ming China’s great productivity was a magnet for
					European maritime states seeking new commercial connections in East Asia, and in
					the early 16th century, European traders finally reached the coast of China. In
					1514, a Portuguese fleet appeared off Canton (now Guangzhou) in the south, and
					by 1557, Portugal had established a permanent base at Macao. Spanish and
					Portuguese merchants (the former operating from Nagasaki in Japan and Manila in
					the Philippines) &ndash; and from 1601, the Dutch &ndash; secured an important
					share in trade with China.</p><p class="calibre14">Even though Ming policy discouraged foreign maritime trade, individual Chinese
					merchants had participated actively in the revived economy. Before long there
					were flourishing Chinese colonies in Manila and on Java in Indonesia, near the
					Dutch-controlled trading city of Batavia, and Chinese merchants controlled a
					large share of local trade in Southeast Asia. The technical sophistication of
					the Chinese porcelain industry under the Ming led for the first time to the mass
					production of ceramics for export to European markets.</p><p class="calibre14">The effects, though, of this growth in trade were not wholly positive: while a
					huge influx of silver from the Americas and Japan, used by the Europeans to pay
					for Chinese goods such as silk, lacquerware, and porcelain, stimulated economic
					growth, it also caused inflation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-533"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000394.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">On taking the throne</span>, Hongwu issued his

					from the Song dynasty, which had left the country at the forefront of many
					scientific fields, including navigation and the military applications of
					gunpowder &ndash; a substance discovered during the Tang era whose use had
					spread to Europe from China in the 13th century. Under the Ming, though, the
					pace of progress slowed and by the later part of the dynasty, ideas had begun to
					flow in from Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">The Chinese military began to use artillery of European manufacture, and
					knowledge of European mathematics and astronomy was introduced to the country
					through Jesuit missionaries, including Matteo Ricci, who lived in Beijing from
					1601 to 1610. He translated the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid’s
						<i class="calibre5">Geometry</i> into Chinese, as well as a
					treatise on the astrolabe (an astronomical instrument used for taking the
					altitude of the sun or stars). In 1626, the German Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von
					Bell wrote the first treatise in Chinese on the telescope, bringing
					Heliocentrism (an astronomical model in which the sun lies at the centre of the
					universe) to a Chinese audience.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-535"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Today the great civil and military officers, the numerous officials and

					of the Yuan. Crop failures reduced the productivity of China’s vast
					agriculture, and famines and floods led to widespread unrest in rural areas. The
					army’s pay began to fall into arrears, leading to discipline problems and
					desertions, while localized peasant uprisings coalesced into more general
					revolts. Meanwhile, on the northeastern frontier, the Manchus had built a state along
					Chinese lines at Mukden in Manchuria &ndash; calling their regime the Qing
					dynasty in 1636 &ndash; and were now poised to take advantage of the
					Ming’s imminent collapse. They were aided in this by a revolt led by Li
					Zicheng, a rebel leader whose forces entered Beijing in 1644 unopposed,
					prompting the emperor to commit suicide. In desperation, the Ming military
					called on the Manchus for help. The tribesmen swept into the capital and drove
					out the rebels, but then seized the throne, and proclaimed the Qing dynasty in
					China.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-537" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">An enduring legacy</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Although the Ming had fallen victim to an agrarian crisis that coincided with
					renewed nomadic activity on its frontiers, this was a combination that had also
					brought down dynasties before it. The bureaucracy that had given China centuries
					of constancy and reduced the possibility, or even the need, for internal
					dissent, was slow to adapt itself to times of fast-moving crisis.</p><p class="calibre14">Yet even so, the Ming era had brought great wealth and success to China. The
					population expanded from around 60 million at the start of its rule, to around
					three times that number by 1600. Much of this growth was centred in medium-sized
					market towns, rather than in large cities, and an increase in agricultural
					production led to the rise of an affluent merchant class in the provinces. Many
					of the elements of orderly government that Hongwu had inaugurated were carried
					over into the succeeding Qing dynasty, providing China with a degree of unity,
					stability, and prosperity that the European states of that period could only
					envy and admire.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-538"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">The voyages of Zheng He</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-539"><span><img alt="" src="images/000184.jpg" class="calibre22" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This silk scroll records</span> one of the

					kingdom in 711. Christian resistance survived in Asturias, in the far north, but
					it took centuries for the kingdoms of Castile, Aragón, León, and
					Navarre to gain the strength to push slowly southwards into Muslim lands. This
					gradual reconquest, known as the Reconquista, gathered pace during the 11th
					century, when the Muslim regions broke up into numerous competing emirates
						(“<i class="calibre5">taifas</i>”) and lost the
					strategically important city of Toledo in central Spain, in 1085.</p><p class="calibre14">The growth of the crusading spirit in western Europe also accelerated the
					progress of the Reconquista. Formal crusades against the Spanish Muslims (or
					Moors) were declared several times from the mid-14th century and a military
					culture emerged, in which raids into al-Andalus acquired the air of righteous
					expeditions. From the 12th century, military orders, such as Santiago and
					Alcántara, were founded. They frequently spearheaded independent thrusts
					into Muslim territory, amassing great wealth in the process, which enabled them
					to sustain extended campaigns and ransom Christians taken prisoner in the wars.
					They also repopulated land conquered from the Muslims with Christians.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-544"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000007.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-545" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The end of Muslim Spain</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In Portugal the Reconquista was completed with the conquest of the Algarve in
					1249, while in Spain the Muslims clung on to power in the south. However, this
					was not to last. In 1474, Queen Isabella ascended to the throne of Castile, in
					northern Spain. Her husband Ferdinand was already king of the neighbouring state
					of Aragón, and they resolved to permanently expel the Muslims from the
					south. The union of the two crowns enabled them to devote more resources to
					completing the Reconquista. It also put an end to centuries of Christian
					infighting, and this unity coincided with a period of Muslim division. From
					1482, the monarchs undertook a series of military campaigns to conquer Granada
					&ndash; the last Muslim emirate in the Iberian peninsula. The cities were put
					under siege and fell one by one, until finally the major city of Granada
					surrendered in 1492.</p><p class="calibre14">Despite an agreement reached at the capitulation of Granada, which contained
					guarantees for freedom of worship, in 1502 the monarchs decreed that any Muslims
					over the age of 14 who refused to convert to Christianity must leave Spain
					within 11 weeks. This edict, combined with the expulsion of the large Jewish
					community in Granada 10 years earlier, left Spain a more homogeneous and less
					tolerant place, and the crusading impulse, now shorn of obvious targets, would
					have to find other channels.</p><p class="calibre14">Christopher Columbus’s expedition to the New World in 1492 &ndash; the

					12th century until 1368, when it was overthrown by the Ming dynasty. Korea was
					left in chaos as its Koryŏ kings tried to reverse the effects of a
					century’s authoritarian domination. The redistribution of land and the
					sacking of pro-Mongol ministers led almost to civil war, but in 1392
					Sejong’s grandfather Yi Sŏngyye, a former general, stepped in,
					deposed the last Koryŏ king, and assumed the throne as King
					T’aejo.</p><p class="calibre14">King T’aejo’s immediate priority was to secure stability, and
					the installation of a state ideology based on neo-Confucianism was key to
					achieving that. This ideology sought to re-establish proper relations between
					the ruler and his people, and conferred privileged status on a bureaucratic
					class that would act as guardian of the social hierarchy. Buddhism had been the
					dominant ideology under the Koryŏ dynasty, but T’aejo undermined
					its hold in the region by breaking up large estates controlled by Buddhist
					temples and redistributing the land, some to Confucian shrines.</p><p class="calibre14">Neo-Confucianism emphasised the importance of education as a way of producing
					a class of literati capable of ensuring the harmonious running of the state.
					T’aejo's grandson, King Sejong (reigned 1418&ndash;1450) raised this
					principle to new heights, founding in 1420 the Chiphyŏn-jŏn (Hall
					of Worthies), an elite group of 20 scholars tasked with research that would
					promote the better running of the kingdom.</p><p class="calibre14">Encouragement of wider literacy was an important neo-Confucian ideal, and
					T’aejo had already ordered the foundation of government-sponsored
					schools. At the time, however, Korean was written in Chinese characters, which
					were not well adapted to express the sounds of the language. Sejong himself is
					said to have developed the simplified script, the Han’gŭl, whose
					principles were explained in <i class="calibre5">Proper Sounds for the
						Education of the People</i>, a book published in 1445. Having only 28
					characters &ndash; later reduced to 24 &ndash; the script was far easier than
					Chinese was to learn, but its introduction faced bitter resistance from
					traditionalist nobles. They feared it might open civil service examinations to
					people from other social classes, which would risk diluting their power. As a
					result Han’gŭl faded from use, relegated as the “vulgar
					letters” of the lower orders, until its rediscovery in the 19th century,
					since when it has thrived as a vehicle for Korean nationalism.</p><p class="calibre14">The reforms of T’aejo and Sejong, however, broadly survived, creating a
					class of yangban &ndash; elite government officials dedicated to the
					perpetuation of the state. The yangban also acted as a break on any tendency to
					autocracy among the Yi monarchs, which helped the resulting dynasty to endure
					for more than five centuries.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-551"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000170.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">King Sejong of Choson</span>, also known as

					the new philosophy rejected superstitious and mystical elements that had
					influenced Confucianism during and after the Han dynasty. Writers such as
					Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the importance of morality, respect for social
					harmony, and education as means of understanding the Supreme Ultimate (<i class="calibre5">tai qi</i>), the underlying principle of the universe.
					In practice, however, neo-Confucian virtues such as loyalty, determination, and

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-13"><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">The course of world events always looks different in retrospect from
				the way that it appears at the time, but the contrast in perspective is rarely as
				extreme as in the Early Modern Era, which spanned the 15th, 16th, and 17th
				centuries. Today, this period is often viewed as the age during which Europe climbed
				towards world domination, but to Europeans living at the time it often seemed to be
				full of unprecedented disasters. The unity of Christendom was split by the
				Reformation, and sectarian conflict between Catholics and Protestants, combined with
				power struggles between competing royal dynasties, made Europe a place of frequent
				warfare &ndash; a continent tearing itself apart. Meanwhile, the Muslim armies of
				the Ottoman Empire threatened the heartland of Europe, seizing the Byzantine city of
				Constantinople and twice penetrating as far as Vienna.</p><p class="calibre14">Yet historical retrospect certainly recognizes changes underway that were to make
				European nations the founders of the modern world. The flowering of arts and ideas
				in the Renaissance meant that Europe ceased to be a cultural backwater. Printing and
				paper, both originally invented in China, were used by Europeans to create
				mass-produced books that went on to revolutionize the dissemination of information.
				Gunpowder weapons, also invented by the Chinese, were deployed most effectively by
				European armies and navies. Above all, explorers and sailors from Europe’s
				western sea-board established oceanic trade routes that laid the foundations for the
				first global economy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-562"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000230.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-563" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The start of colonialism</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The importance of Christopher Columbus’s transatlantic voyage in 1492
					cannot be exaggerated. It established a permanent link between two entire
					ecosystems that had evolved in isolation from each another for almost 10,000
					years. The initial impact on the inhabitants of the Americas was catastrophic.
					Eurasian diseases and the infamous brutality of the Spanish conquistadors
					decimated the population. A remarkably small number of European invaders
					conquered the most sophisticated American states with startling ease, laying
					potentially the entire New World open to European exploitation and
					colonization.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the arrival of European sailors in Asia did not have the same
					dramatic impact. Powerful countries, including India, Imperial China, the Moghul
					Empire, and the Japanese shogunate at first merely tolerated the Europeans as
					traders, allowing them to control only a few islands or enclaves along the
					coast, as long as they did not interfere or become too troublesome.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-564" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Economic growth</h2></div><p class="calibre15">From the second half of the 17th century, signs of economic growth accelerated
					in Europe. Productivity of labour in trades and agriculture increased notably in
					areas like the Dutch Netherlands. New financial institutions, such as central
					banks and joint stock companies, laid the foundations of modern capitalism.
					Complex patterns of maritime trade linked European colonies in the Americas to
					Europe, Africa, and Asia. Slaves, mostly bought by European traders in West
					Africa, were transported in vast numbers to work on colonial plantations, so
					that in some parts of the New World people of African descent greatly
					outnumbered both Europeans and the native population. At home, Europeans
					consumed luxury goods from China and India, and products such as sugar and
					coffee from plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil. North America, the West
					Indies, and India were all regions of colonial contention &ndash; the
					precipitous decline of the Mughal Empire having opened up parts of India to
					European territorial conquest.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-565" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Intellectual movements</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Even at this stage, the degree of European ascendancy should not be
					exaggerated. China had gone through difficult times in the mid-17th century
					transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, but in the 18th century, imperial
					China was enjoying a golden age of power and prosperity. The population of
					Europe had begun a steep increase to unprecedented levels &ndash; a result of
					improved food production and declining epidemic diseases &ndash; but China also
					experienced rapid population growth.</p><p class="calibre14">What really marked out Europe as unique at this time was the development of
					knowledge and thought. The 17th-century scientific revolution began a
					transformation of our understanding of the universe. The rationalist movement
					known as the Enlightenment challenged all preconceptions, traditions, and
					conventions. The modern world was under construction in the European
					mind.</p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The loss of this millennium-old
				Christian empire, which had once stretched virtually all the way around the
				Mediterranean, was a profound shock to the Christian world. As if to symbolize the
				Muslim victory Sancta Sophia, one of the greatest cathedrals in Christendom, was
				converted into a mosque.</p><p class="calibre14">The Ottoman Turks had already conquered much of the surrounding territory before
				Sultan Mehmet II (1432&ndash;1481) laid siege to the city and bombarded it with
				heavy artillery. Having breached its walls, his army of more than 80,000 men then
				overwhelmed the small force inside. Constantine XI, the last Byzantine emperor, was
				killed, and with the fall of the city his empire ended. Constantinople then became
				the capital of the Ottoman Empire, which lasted until 1922.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-568"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"[Blood flowed] like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Nicolò Barbaro <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">Eyewitness to the fall of

					Constantinople was taken. It had shrunk to include only the capital city, some
					land to its west, and the southern part of Greece. The decline began at the
					Battle of Manzikert (1071), during which the army of the Turkish Seljuk dynasty
					drove the Byzantines out of their crucial territory in Anatolia. From this
					point, rival claims for the Byzantine crown, disputes over tax, loss of trade
					revenue, and poor military leadership all contributed to the contraction of the
					empire.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1203, the Fourth Crusade &ndash; a western European expedition originally
					intended to conquer Jerusalem &ndash; became entangled in the empire’s
					politics. Some of the crusade leaders pledged to help restore the deposed
					Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in return for support for their expedition.
					They were initially successful: Angelos’ son was crowned as co-emperor
					but, in 1204, he in turn was deposed by a popular uprising. The Byzantine senate
					elected a young noble, Nicolas Canabus, as emperor, and he refused to back the
					crusaders. Denied their promised payments, the crusaders and their allies, the
					Venetians, responded with a ruthless attack on the city. They raped and killed
					civilians, looted churches, and demolished priceless works of art.
					Constantinople was all but destroyed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-570"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000176.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">When lighted tapers were</span> put to the

					Anatolia into the Balkans. Afterwards, in the 16th century, it expanded into the
					eastern Mediterranean, along the banks of the Red Sea, and into North Africa.
					The defeat of the Mamelukes in Egypt in 1536, and wars against the Safavids, one
					of Persia’s most significant ruling dynasties, gave the Ottomans control
					of a whole swathe of the Arab Middle East. </p><p class="calibre14">The Ottoman Empire was a Muslim State and the sultans saw it as their duty to
					promote the spread of Islam. Nevertheless it tolerated Christians and Jews in a
					subsidiary status and made extensive use of slaves. Many languages were spoken
					and faiths followed within its domains, but it dealt with the potentially
					conflicting religious and political differences by setting up vassal
					(subordinate) states in some regions. Territories such as Transylvania and the
					Crimea paid tribute (made regular payments) to the emperor, but they were not
					ruled by him directly, and acted as buffer zones between Muslim and Christian
					areas. Some vassal states, including Bulgaria, Serbia, and Bosnia, were
					eventually absorbed into the larger empire; others retained their vassal
					status.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-572"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000081.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-573" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Government and military</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Ottomans evolved a strong system of government that combined local
					administration with central control. The sultan &ndash; whose brothers were
					customarily murdered at his accession &ndash; was supreme ruler. He had a
					council of advisers, later a deputy, who ruled on his behalf. Local areas were
					ruled by military governors (beys) under the emperor’s overall control,
					but local councils kept the beys’ authority in check.</p><p class="calibre14">Non-Muslim communities within the empire were allowed a degree of self-rule
					through a system of separate courts called millets. The millets allowed
					Armenian, Jewish, and Orthodox Christian communities to rule according to their
					own laws in cases that did not involve Muslims. This balanced combination of
					central and local control enabled the Ottomans to hold together a large and
					diverse empire for much longer than would have been possible with a more wholly
					centralized system.</p><p class="calibre14">The Ottoman army was also crucial to the empire’s success. It was
					technically advanced &ndash; employing cannon from the siege of Constantinople
					onwards &ndash; and tactically sophisticated. Its high-speed cavalry units
					could turn what looked like a retreat into a devastatingly effective flanking
					attack, surrounding the enemy in a crescent-shaped formation that would take
					them by surprise.</p><p class="calibre14">At the heart of the army were the Janissaries, a unit of infantry that began
					as the imperial guard and expanded to become the most feared elite force of the
					period. Initially, the unit was made up of men who, as children, had been
					abducted from Christian families in the Balkans. Under the <i class="calibre5">devsirme</i> system, which was also known as the
					“blood tax” or “tribute in blood”, boys aged from
					eight to 18 were taken by Ottoman military, forcibly converted to Islam, and
					sent to live with Turkish families, where they learned the Turkish language and
					customs. They were then given rigorous military training, and any who showed
					particular talent were selected for specialized roles ranging from archers to
					engineers. Janissaries were not permitted to marry until they retired from
					active duty, but they received special benefits and privileges designed to
					secure their sole allegiance to the ruler. Although they made up only a small
					proportion in the Ottoman army, they had a leading role and played a key part in
					many victories, including those over the Egyptians, Hungarians, and
					Constantinople.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-574"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000148.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Janissaries wore</span> distinctive uniforms
							and, unlike other military units, were paid salaries and lived in
							barracks. They were the first corps to make extensive use of
							firearms.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-575" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Ottoman heyday</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The empire reached its peak under Emperor Suleiman the Magnificent. He forged
					an alliance with the French against the Habsburg rulers of the Holy Roman
					Empire, and signed a treaty with the Safavid rulers of Persia that divided
					Armenia and Georgia between the two powers and put most of Iraq into Ottoman
					hands. Suleiman conquered much of Hungary, and even laid siege to Vienna,
					although he did not succeed in taking it.</p><p class="calibre14">The Ottomans took their Islamic faith to their territories, building mosques
					everywhere &ndash; and with the mosques came scholarship and education. Ottoman
					cities were impressive. Constantinople itself was virtually rebuilt: the
					Ottomans reinforced its fortifications as well as adding many mosques, bazaars,
					and water fountains. The city’s dazzling centrepiece was the royal palace
					of Topkapi, commissioned by Sultan Mehmet II in around the 1460s. Masons,
					stonecutters, and carpenters were summoned from far and wide to ensure the
					complex would be an enduring monument. It contained mosques, a hospital,
					bakeries, and a mint among much else, and attached to it were imperial societies
					of artists and craftsmen who produced some of the finest work in the
					empire.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-576"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000396.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Naturalistic motifs</span> in cobalt blues and

					empire faced serious challenges in other arenas. A rising population was putting
					pressure on available land; there were military threats and internal revolts;
					and defeat by a coalition of Catholic forces at the sea battle of Lepanto in
					1571 prevented the empire’s expansion further along the European side of
					the Mediterranean.</p><p class="calibre14">The Ottoman empire steadily lost prestige and influence until its decline
					earned it the title “the sick man of Europe”. Incapable of
					responding to the convulsions of the 19th century, it lost territory and
					struggled against a rising tide of nationalism among its conquered peoples. Its
					long history finally ended with defeat in World War I and the foundation of the
					modern Turkish state by Kemal Attatürk.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-578"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MEHMET II<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-579"><img alt="" src="images/000105.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Mehmet (1432&ndash;1481), the son of the Ottoman emperor Murad II, was born
					in Edirne, Turkey. As was usual for an heir to the Ottoman throne, Mehmet had an
					Islamic education, and at 11 years old was appointed governor of a province,
					Amasya, to gain experience of leadership. A year later, Murad abdicated in
					favour of his son, but shortly afterwards was called back from his retirement in
					Anatolia to lend military support. “If you are the Sultan,” Mehmet
					wrote, “come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I order you to
					come and lead my armies”.</p><p class="calibre11">Mehmet’s second, main, rule was from 1451 to 1481. His victory at
					Constantinople was followed by a string of further conquests: the Morea
					(southern Greece), Serbia, the coast of the Black Sea, Wallachia, Bosnia, and
					part of the Crimea. He rebuilt Constantinople as his capital and founded mosques
					there, while also allowing Christians and Jews to worship freely. Known for his
					ruthless military leadership, he also welcomed humanists to the capital,
					encouraged culture, and founded a university.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-45" class="calibre3">Belisarius retakes Rome</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-28" class="calibre3">Muhammad receives the divine

				between America and Europe, and changed the world.</p><p class="calibre14">When he set out, Columbus was expecting to reach Asia, since no Europeans at the
				time knew that an entire continent blocked this route. When he reached an island in
				the Bahamas after sailing for five weeks, he believed that he had arrived at the
				outer reaches of Indonesia. From there, Columbus continued to explore the Caribbean,
				visiting Cuba, Hispaniola, and several of the smaller islands. He met with a mostly
				peaceful response from the native people, whom he observed might make good servants
				or slaves. He also noticed their gold jewellery, and took a sample of local gold, as
				well as some native prisoners, back to Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">Columbus was to return to the Caribbean on three later voyages, bringing in his
				wake countless European visitors and settlers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-582"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000033.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-583" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Motivation to explore</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The rulers and merchants of Western Europe wanted to explore the Atlantic for
					primarily economic reasons. Spices that would not grow in Europe’s
					climate, such as cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, were prized not
					only for their taste but also because they could help to preserve foods. There
					was also an enthusiastic market for luxury goods such as silk and precious
					stones, commodities that came primarily from the islands of the Indonesian
					group, such as the Moluccas, which were known in Europe as the Spice
					Islands.</p><p class="calibre14">Bringing such commodities across Asia by land was difficult and dangerous
					because of local wars and instabilities along the route; it was also costly,
					since during their journey goods would pass through many different
					merchants’ hands. There were certainly excellent economic reasons to
					develop sea routes: anyone who could find a more direct way of importing these
					goods to Western Europe would become very rich.</p><p class="calibre14">Another reason why Europeans started to explore sea routes in the late Middle
					Ages was to investigate the possibility of establishing European colonies in
					Asia. These could act not only as trading posts, but also as bases for
					missionaries, who could convert the locals to Christianity. This they believed
					would help to reduce the perceived threat of Islam.</p><p class="calibre14">By the 14th and 15th centuries, the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch
					had developed ocean-going ships, and trained sailors who could navigate over
					long distances. Explorers used various types of vessel, among the most
					successful of which was the caravel &ndash; a fast, lightweight, and extremely
					manoeuvrable ship which was usually equipped with a mix of square and lateen
					(triangular) sails. The lateen sails made it possible to sail to windward (into
					the wind), which allowed explorers to make progress even in variable wind
					conditions. Explorers also used the carrack, or nau, a larger vessel that was
					similarly rigged. On his first transatlantic voyage Columbus took two caravels,
					each probably of 50&ndash;70 tons, and one carrack of about 100 tons, the extra
					capacity being useful for carrying stores.</p><p class="calibre14">Skills and technology quickly developed in both shipbuilding and navigation.
					Sailors used the cross-staff &ndash; a basic sighting device &ndash; or later
					a mariner’s astrolabe, to calculate a vessel’s latitude. They
					achieved this by measuring angles, such as the angle of the sun to the horizon.
					They used a magnetic compass to gauge direction, and their charts and knowledge
					of prevailing winds and currents improved with each voyage.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-584"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"I intend to go and see if I can find the island of Japan."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Christopher Columbus, 1492</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-585" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Portuguese navigators</h2></div><p class="calibre15">European navigators had been striking out into the Atlantic for many decades.
					Sailors from Bristol, England, for example, were sailing in the 1470s in search
					of a mythical island called “Brasil”, thought to be west of
					Ireland. The Portuguese established trading colonies on Madeira, and Prince
					Henry the Navigator, son of Portugal’s King John I, commissioned numerous
					journeys of exploration to the Azores in the 15th century. Henry had started the
					first school for oceanic navigation, with an astronomical observatory at Sagres,
					Portugal in about 1418. Here he promoted the study of navigation, map-making,
					and science. Henry sent ships down the west coast of Africa, to which he was
					particularly attracted by the potential to trade in slaves and gold. His ships
					pushed southwards, setting up trading posts along the way. Subsequent rulers
					continued to sponsor voyages and, in 1488, Portuguese captain Bartolomeu Dias
					rounded the southern tip of Africa. Soon another Portuguese navigator, Vasco da
					Gama, led the push to round the Cape and pressed on across the Indian Ocean,
					linking Europe and Asia for the first time by ocean route.</p><p class="calibre14">Since Portugal dominated the sea route along the African coast,
					Portugal’s European neighbour and rival Spain needed to find an
					alternative route, if it was to gain access to the riches of the East. Though
					educated people knew by this time that the Earth was round, they did not know
					about the existence of the Americas. An alternative way to the East seemed,
					therefore, to be to sail west across the Atlantic. This route seemed especially
					attractive to the many seamen &ndash; including Christopher Columbus &ndash;
					who believed the planet’s diameter to be rather smaller than it actually
					is.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-586"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Such inhumanities and Barbarisms were committed... acts so foreign to

					across the Atlantic to the Spice Islands. John refused to invest in the scheme,
					however. This was partly because Portugal was already exploring the West African
					coast with some success, and partly because the experts John consulted about the
					proposal were sceptical about the distances involved.</p><p class="calibre14">Columbus cast his net more widely, seeking backing from the powerful maritime
					cities of Genoa and Venice, and sending his brother to England to do the same
					&ndash; but still he received no encouragement. He therefore turned to
					Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the “Catholic
					Monarchs” who jointly ruled Spain. At first they turned him down, their
					navigational consultants also sceptical about the length of his proposed route,
					but eventually, after protracted negotiations, they agreed to sponsor the
					voyage. Securing a new trade route would certainly bring material rewards, but
					Isabella also saw the voyage in terms of a religious mission that could bring
					the light of Christianity to the East.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-588"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000389.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Columbus’s voyage</span> was a bold
							undertaking. Despite a general understanding that the world was
							spherical, many believed the westward journey was doomed to fail,

					for Spain, plus other benefits including 10 per cent of any revenues they
					yielded, Columbus set sail westwards in 1492. He called at Gran Canaria before
					sailing west, sighting land five weeks later. In early 1493 he returned to
					Europe with two ships, the third having been wrecked off the coast of
					present-day Haiti, and was duly appointed Governor of the Indies.</p><p class="calibre14">Columbus’s second expedition was organized just a few months later.
					This involved 17 ships loaded with some 1,200 people who would found Spanish
					colonies in the Caribbean. As well as farmers and soldiers, the colonists
					included priests, who were specifically charged with converting local people to
					Christianity. Religious conversion became a key part of European colonization,
					illustrating the colonist’s ambition to impose their own culture and
					exert control over newly colonized peoples.</p><p class="calibre14">Columbus’s achievement in 1492 is often described as the European
					“discovery” of America. This is a problematic claim not only
					because Columbus thought he had reached Asia, but also because Vikings from
					Scandinavia had reached North America some 500 years earlier &ndash;
					archaeological remains at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland reveal that
					they even settled there. However, the Viking settlement was not long-lived, and
					was unknown to Columbus and his contemporaries.</p><p class="calibre14">Nevertheless, Columbus’s 1492 journey did inaugurate a lasting contact
					between the Americas and Europe. The pitiless destruction he and his men wrought
					upon the indigenous peoples of the West Indies, whom he encountered when he
					first arrived in the Americas, also began a process of decimation of native
					American populations that would continue for a century.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-590"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"I should not proceed by land to the East, as is customary, but by a

				Spain, that resolved the countries’ disputes about the possession of newly
				discovered territory. The rulers settled on a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape
				Verde Islands as a line of demarcation. All the lands to the west of this line would
				belong to Spain; all those to the east would belong to Portugal. The line was chosen
				because of its location: it lies roughly halfway between the Cape Verde Islands,
				which already belonged to Portugal, and the Caribbean islands, which Christopher
				Columbus had claimed for Spain in 1492.</p><p class="calibre14">By the 1490s both countries were discovering substantial territories, including
				lands in the New World, although at this point the size and extent of the Americas
				was unclear to Europeans. In spite of the fact that the Spanish Crown had funded
				Columbus’s voyages, Spain’s claim to his discoveries was not
				clear-cut. The 1479 Alcaçovas treaty between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain
				and the rulers of Portugal gave all newly discovered lands south of the Canary
				Islands to Portugal. When Columbus landed at Lisbon after his first voyage, he told
				John II, king of Portugal, that he was claiming Hispaniola and Cuba for his Spanish
				backers. John wrote to Spain’s rulers immediately to say that he was
				preparing to send his own ships to claim the Caribbean for Portugal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-596"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000083.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-597" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Legalizing possession</h2></div><p class="calibre15">To prevent such disputes erupting each time a navigator made a fresh
					discovery, the leaders of both countries decided to review the terms of the
					Alcaçovas treaty. The papacy had been involved in the 1479 treaty, and
					now Pope Alexander VI (a Spaniard) proposed a combined north&ndash;south and
					east&ndash;west dividing line, suggesting that any lands west and south of a
					line 100 leagues west and south of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands be
					allocated to Spain. John rejected the proposition, considering it to be biased
					in favour of his rivals, and eventually all parties agreed on the meridian
					between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean. The resulting treaty set the
					agenda for future colonization, and influenced the fate of vast swathes of the
					world.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-598"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"I and my companions suffer from a disease of the heart that can be cured

					headway in exploring Africa and southern Asia. Working south from a North
					African base at Ceuta, explorers established a series of trading posts on the
					West African coast, gradually pushing south until, in 1498, Vasco da Gama
					rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed into the Indian Ocean. In the 16th
					century, Portugal had settlements in India, the Moluccas, Sumatra, Burma, and
					Thailand, and by 1557 they had established their long-standing enclave in Macau,
					which became a hub for their trade with many Asian communities.</p><p class="calibre14">The treaty line passed through South America, allocating a north-western
					portion to the Portuguese. In 1500, explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landed
					on the coast of Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. The conquistadors exploited
					their new colony, forcing indigenous peoples to cultivate sugar cane, and later
					to grow coffee, and mine gold. The labourers died in huge numbers, both from
					diseases introduced by the colonists, and as a result of their ruthless
					treatment, and slaves were brought in from Africa to replace them. Brazil, ruled
					from the mid-16th century by Portuguese governors-general, remained a colony
					until the early 19th century.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-600" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Spanish in America</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Following Columbus’s transatlantic voyages and the settlement of the
					treaty, Spain turned increasingly to America, sponsoring expeditions that
					combined exploration with conquest and colonization. The first of these, led by
					Hernán Cortés, was to Mexico, which was then home to the small but
					rich Aztec Empire. The empire’s large, central capital was at
					Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City). With just a small force of about 600 men,
					Cortés overthrew the million-strong empire, eventually killing its ruler,
					Moctezuma. Another Spanish leader, Francisco Pizarro, conquered the Inca Empire,
					which centred on Peru but also included Chile, Ecuador, and large parts of
					Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. Again with just a small force (180 men),
					Pizarro laid the foundations of another Spanish stronghold and source of great
					wealth in precious metals. Peruvian silver became the main source of
					Spain’s income from its colonies.</p><p class="calibre14">Several factors contributed to Cortés’ and Pizarro’s
					astounding conquests. The Aztecs were overwhelmed by a kind of battle unknown to
					them, involving firearms and the single-minded slaughter of opponents &ndash;
					Aztec practice was to capture prisoners, whom they would later kill in ritual
					sacrifice. The Spanish were also helped by alliances they made with local
					peoples who were hostile to the Aztecs. The result for Spain was a flow of
					wealth across the Atlantic and a secure base for building on their involvement
					in the Americas.</p><p class="calibre14">Further Spanish colonization followed, including that of Colombia, known to
					the Spanish as New Granada. By the end of the 17th century, much of western and
					central South America was in Spanish hands. Conquered areas, and the people who
					lived in them, were parcelled out to the Spanish conquistadors, who undertook to
					convert the locals to Christianity. They did convert them, but they also made
					them perform forced labour, especially in the silver mines. Labourers fell
					victim to disease and exploitation &ndash; like their counterparts in Brazil,
					but on a lesser scale &ndash; and slaves from Africa were brought in to
					supplement their numbers.</p><p class="calibre14">The Spanish Crown tried to control this large empire, appointing viceroys to
					rule over the settlers and the native American peoples, and taking a fifth of
					the profits from silver mining. Settlers increasingly resisted this external
					interference, however, and by the 19th century the empire was diminishing as
					areas from Colombia to Chile won their independence.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-601"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000291.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The siege of Tenochtitlan</span>, the Aztec

					in America, but this deterred neither Spain nor Portugal from looking for a
					westward route to eastern Asia, a potential source of spices, luxury goods, and
					great wealth for traders from Europe. Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator
					working for the Portuguese Crown, was one of the first to take this exploration
					further. He explored the coast of South America, and is remembered because
					America is named after him. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was next
					to explore this route, this time on behalf of Spain. He believed that the Spice
					Islands could be less than halfway around the world when sailing west from the
					treaty line, which would give Spain a claim to them. In 1519 he set out with
					five ships in an ambitious attempt to make the first circumnavigation of the
					globe. Although Magellan himself died en route, some of the expedition survivors
					completed the voyage, giving Spain a basis for its claim to land in Southeast
					Asia.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1529 the rival Crowns signed another treaty, at Zaragoza. This agreement
					gave the Philippines to Spain and the Moluccas to Portugal.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-603"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Those regions which we found and explored with the fleet… we may

					and soon began to move in to develop their own empires. Britain colonized North
					America, for example, the Dutch moved into the Spice Islands, and several
					European countries set up colonies in the Caribbean. The treaty did however
					influence a significant proportion of the world. It underlined a development
					that was already beginning in Europe in which wealth and influence were passing
					from the old central European powers (based in the Holy Roman Empire) to the
					coastal, maritime powers that looked to build empires in new territories. These
					empires brought both Spain and Portugal enormous riches, and their overseas
					empires left a significant cultural legacy: much of South and Central America is
					Spanish-speaking, and there is a major Portuguese heritage in parts of Africa
					and Asia, the greatest of all being in Brazil.</p></div><div class="section_feature6" id="calibre_link-605"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">FERDINAND MAGELLAN<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-606"><img alt="" src="images/000261.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Born into a noble Portuguese family, Magellan (1480&ndash;1521) was orphaned

					colonies in India and took part in the conquest of the Moluccas, but after a
					disagreement with the Portuguese king, he went to Spain to look for support for
					his venture westward. By 1518 he had the backing of the Spanish king Charles I,
					and set off the following year with five ships.</p><p class="calibre11">After losing one ship to the weather and another to a desertion, Magellan
					navigated the narrow sea route (named the Strait of Magellan in his honour)
					between what is now mainland South America and Tierra del Fuego. He emerged in
					an ocean he named Pacific, because of its calmness. He crossed this expanse of
					water, stopping at Guam, and then in the Philippines, where he was killed. Only
					one ship, under Juan Sebastien del Cano, made it back to Europe in 1522, having

				&ndash; the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, commonly known as Il Duomo. The
				city of Florence was one of the richest in Italy, a centre of banking and trade and
				it was on the basis of this wealth that the city could afford to commission a
				cathedral dome of unprecedented size.</p><p class="calibre14">This lavish spending on art and architecture would soon be echoed across Italy, as
				the region’s growing prosperity meant that rulers and rich citizens could
				spend money to beautify their towns and enhance their prestige. The strong economy
				and deep civic pride in Italy laid the foundations for one of the most significant
				intellectual movements in history: the Renaissance.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-609"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"This enormous construction towering above the skies, vast enough to cover the

					octagonal space towards its eastern end, but since work on the building began in
					1296 no one had worked out how to make a dome to cover it. The dome would have
					to be the largest cupola constructed since the late Roman period and the guild
					specified that it should be built without external buttresses, favoured by their
					political rivals in France, Germany, and Milan and also considered
					old-fashioned. This seemed an impossible task. The young goldsmith and
					clockmaker-turned-architect Filippo Brunelleschi won the competition with his
					daring plan for a huge eight-sided brick dome, but many doubted that he would be
					able to construct it.</p><p class="calibre14">The main problem was being able to support the structure in such a way that it
					did not spread and collapse under its own weight. Brunelleschi’s
					ingenious solution was to construct two concentric domes &ndash; an inner
					supporting dome and a larger outer one. The domes were then joined together with
					huge brick arches and a complex interlocking system of “chains”
					made from rings of stone and wooden beams that were attached by iron clamps to
					prevent the dome from expanding outwards.</p><p class="calibre14">The result &ndash; which was finally completed in 1436 &ndash; remains the
					largest masonry dome in the world. Combining the style of antiquity with new
					engineering techniques, it exhibited the blend of ancient wisdom and modern
					knowledge that typified the Renaissance.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-611"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000315.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Dominating the skyline</span> of Florence,

					in Italy and began to spread across Europe from the mid-14th century. Its roots
					lay in the rediscovery of the culture of ancient Greece and Rome and it
					influenced all the arts, as well as science and scholarship. Painters,
					sculptors, and architects broke free from the traditions of medieval art. They
					visited the monuments of ancient Rome, looking at classical statues and the
					carvings on Roman buildings, and created works of art in the classical style.
					This new movement inspired architects, such as Leon Battista Alberti and
					Brunelleschi, and a wave of great artists, including Michelangelo and Leonardo
					da Vinci. Most of these figures were active in many fields &ndash; Brunelleschi
					was a sculptor and engineer as well as an architect; Michelangelo painted,
					sculpted, and wrote poetry; while da Vinci’s achievements spanned both
					the arts and the sciences.</p><p class="calibre14">Renaissance painters and sculptors sought to represent the physical world in a
					more realistic way than their Medieval predecessors: they valued anatomical
					accuracy and developed scientific methods of illustrating perspective. As in
					classical art, there was more focus on human beauty and the nude.</p><p class="calibre14">There was also a revival of interest in classical learning, which was
					influenced by Greek scholars from the Byzantine Empire, who settled in Italy
					when Constantinople (the empire’s capital) fell in 1453. The <i class="calibre5">émigrés</i> brought with them ancient
					Greek literary, historical, and philosophical texts, which had been lost to the
					West, and taught the Italians Greek so they could read and translate the works.
					This led to the emergence of Renaissance Humanism in Italy, which involved
					studying the humanities &ndash; grammar, rhetoric, history, philosophy, and
					poetry &ndash; and, more broadly, a high regard for the dignity and potential
					of the human race.</p><p class="calibre14">At the time of the Renaissance, life, business, and politics in Italy were
					dominated by a number of powerful city-states &ndash; mainly Florence, Milan,
					Ferrara, and Venice &ndash; together with Rome, from where the pope could
					exercise great secular (“temporal”) power as well as being the
					spiritual head of the Catholic Church. The city-states generated a lot of wealth
					from trade and &ndash; as in the case of Florence &ndash; banking. Their
					ruling families, such as the Gonzaga in Mantua, the d’Este in Ferrara,
					the Sforza in Milan, and the Medici in Florence, spent lavishly on palaces,
					churches, and works of art, and became patrons of many great Renaissance
					artists. These wealthy families also encouraged the revival of classical
					learning by employing scholars as tutors for their children. In addition,
					several members of the Medici family became popes.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-613"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000182.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Michelangelo’s</span> painted ceiling

					parts of Europe and a Northern Renaissance emerged. Northern countries,
					particularly the Netherlands and Germany, produced their own great artists, such
					as Albrecht Dürer (1471&ndash;1528) and Hans Holbein the Younger
					(1497&ndash;1543) &ndash; both gifted realists. Renaissance Humanism also
					spread northwards, but northern writers and philosophers, most notably Erasmus
					of Rotterdam (1466&ndash;1536), tended to place more emphasis on Christianity,
					education, and reform than their Italian counterparts.</p><p class="calibre14">The invention of printing using movable type by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany
					in the 1430s enabled Renaissance ideas to spread even more quickly. Before
					Gutenberg, the only way printed text was possible was for each page to be carved
					by hand into a block of wood, but as this was so laborious books were invariably
					written out by hand. Gutenberg’s method involved arranging individual
					metal letters and punctuation symbols in lines and pages; when many copies of a
					page had been printed, the type could be taken apart and reused. He combined
					this new idea with the existing technology of paper-making and the kind of press
					used in wine production, and the result was the printing of multiple copies of
					books for the first time.</p><p class="calibre14">Gutenberg’s invention had a major impact. It meant that books, which
					had previously been costly and took months to produce, were now easily available
					and much more affordable, so ideas and information could circulate quickly and
					reach more people. While the church had used mostly Latin as its universal
					language, writers now wrote in their local tongues, and as a result literature
					in French, English, German, and other languages flourished. In addition, copies
					of the ancient classics were reproduced in quantity, thus helping to spread
					ideas that were central to both the Renaissance and Humanism.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-615"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000157.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The idea of the Renaissance Man</span>, whose

					southern Europe, but it lasted slightly longer in the north. However, many great
					Renaissance works endured and they continued to inspire future generations of
					painters and architects. Indeed, the longstanding popularity of oil paintings
					and classical style of architecture, and the rise of Humanism, would all have
					been impossible without the movement that began with Brunelleschi in Florence in
					the 15th century.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-617"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"For the wise man there is nothing invisible."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Filippo Brunelleschi</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div class="section_feature7" id="calibre_link-618"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-619"><img alt="" src="images/000130.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Born in Florence, Filippo Brunelleschi (1377&ndash;1446) was the son of a

					footsteps. However, Filippo was artistically talented and instead trained as a
					goldsmith and a clockmaker before becoming an architect. When he was around 25,
					he travelled to Rome with his friend, the sculptor Donatello, where he studied
					the remains of ancient Roman buildings and read the treatise <i class="calibre5">On Architecture</i> by the Roman writer Vitruvius. In
					1419, he won his first major commission &ndash; the design of an orphanage, the
					Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence, which, with its arched loggia, is one of
					the first great Renaissance buildings. A number of other fine works, including
					chapels in Florentine churches and fortifications for the city, cemented his
					reputation, but the stunning dome of Il Duomo is his masterpiece. In addition to
					his buildings, Brunelleschi did important work on the theory of linear
					perspective, and designed machinery to produce special effects in theatrical
					productions.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-41" class="calibre3">Athenian democracy</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-40" class="calibre3">The assassination of Julius Caesar</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-44" class="calibre3">The Sack of Rome</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-31" class="calibre3">The fall of Constantinople</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre3">Christopher Columbus reaches America</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-75" class="calibre3">Martin Luther’s 95 theses</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				enough to contain 10,000 men, and were armed with some 300 guns under the command of
				artillery expert Jean Bureau. Expecting reinforcements, Talbot signalled an attack
				but as the English approached, they found themselves outnumbered by a well-prepared
				army. The French artillery fired, their bowmen followed suit, and the English were
				mown down en masse. It was the first field battle in European history to be decided
				by gunpowder.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-622"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000087.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-623" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Hundred Years’ War ends</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Battle of Castillon was the climax of the Hundred Years’ War,
					fought since 1337 by England and France, countries that had long been closely
					linked by their ruling families. By the time of Castillon, great changes had
					taken place in the fabric of European life, which profoundly altered the armies
					with which the French and English monarchs fought.</p><p class="calibre14">The Europe of the 15th century was principally a money economy, and everyone,
					including soldiers, expected to be paid. Kings were thus increasingly reliant on
					mercenaries who fought for pay. This was a sharp contrast to the feudal system
					that had existed previously, in which fighting men were provided by the nobility
					in exchange for land. Eventually, rulers began employing mercenaries on a
					permanent basis: a standing army. But it wasn’t until the later 17th
					century that this model became the norm.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-624"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"There is no wall, whatever its thickness, that artillery will not destroy

					and expensive artillery. Cannons, like those that secured the French victory at
					Castillon, transformed warfare. The stout walls of medieval castles provided
					little defence against a cannonball. To better resist artillery rulers began,
					from the 16th century, to build a new type of fortification, the star fort.
					These forts had walls sunk into ditches to strengthen them against direct fire
					and also used cannons themselves in an active defence.</p><p class="calibre14">At the same time, hand firearms that fired projectiles that smashed through
					the armour of mounted knights and required little skill to wield, gradually
					replaced the bow. Drilled infantry &ndash; wielding pikes and firearms &ndash;
					replaced massed ranks of archers, and formed the core of the new line of
					battle.</p><p class="calibre14">To pay for their new armies, rulers steadily began to centralize their
					domains. More efficient taxation systems and bureaucracies were established,
					curbing the power of an aristocracy whose influence was already diminished by
					the decline of the feudal system.</p><p class="calibre14">Victory at Castillon, guaranteed by gunpowder, ensured the survival of an
					independent France that was becoming more like a centralized state and less like
					a feudal country. As a result of the French triumph, France was able to
					consolidate the territory under its control and the map of this part of western
					Europe began to take on its modern form. England, bereft of its European
					possessions, also became more centralized, and its rulers turned away from
					continental Europe, leveraging the country’s resources to begin maritime
					exploration of the Atlantic and North America.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-626"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000062.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">French troops</span> (left) engage with the

				thousands of years. In the so-called Columbian Exchange, lives and economies that
				had altered only gradually over centuries were suddenly transformed by the influx of
				new crops, animals, technology, and pathogens. Many of the effects were unforeseen
				and misunderstood by both Europeans and Native Americans at the time, but once the
				first landing had been made, there was no turning back.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-629"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"[The lands are] very suitable for planting and cultivating, for raising

					own domesticated animals and foods. The enormous range included citrus fruits,
					grapes, and bananas; coffee, sugar cane, rice, oats, and wheat; and cattle,
					sheep, pigs, and horses. To cultivate their crops and pasture their animals, the
					settlers cleared huge areas of woodland, destroying the habitats of some native
					wild species in the process, and unintentionally contaminating American fields
					with the seed of weeds such as dandelion and sow thistle. The exchange in the
					other direction brought potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, beans, pumpkins, squash,
					and tobacco to the Old World, as well as turkeys and guinea pigs.</p><p class="calibre14">The introduction of new staple crops transformed lives on both sides of the
					Atlantic. Potatoes and maize, carbohydrate-rich and easily grown, helped
					overcome chronic food shortages in Europe and, along with manioc and sweet
					potatoes, spread on to Africa and Asia. In the New World wheat, which thrived in
					the temperate latitudes of North and South America and in the highlands of
					Mexico, eventually became a fundamental food crop for tens of millions of
					settlers. The arrival of horses in the New World was also revolutionary,
					permitting more effective and selective hunting, as well as facilitating travel
					and transport.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-631"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000018.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-632" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Biological catastrophe</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The most immediately devastating impact of the Columbian Exchange followed the
					introduction of new diseases into the Americas. The settlers and the chickens,
					cattle, black rats, and mosquitoes that accompanied them introduced contagious
					diseases to a people who had no biological defence against them. Native
					Americans’ immune systems were not adapted to cope with alien diseases
					such as smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenza, malaria, and yellow fever.
					Once they were exposed to them, they began to die in their hundreds of
					thousands. Half the Cherokee nation died in a smallpox epidemic in 1738, and
					some other tribes were wiped out entirely. European explorers encountered and
					brought back American illnesses such as Chagas Disease, but the effect on Old
					World populations was negligible compared with the consequences of Old World
					pathogens in the New World.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-633" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Exchange economics</h2></div><p class="calibre15">From the start, the Columbian Exchange had a strong economic driver.
					Commodities ranging from gold and silver to coffee, tobacco, and cane sugar were
					transported on a vast scale, mostly to the benefit of European traders and
					plantation owners.</p><p class="calibre14">Very soon, slave trading became a key part of this network too. The movement
					of people from continent to continent in vast numbers provided a continual
					supply of labour for expanding new economies at the cost of unspeakable
					oppression, misery, and early death to many generations. The dramatic and
					irrevocable changes brought about on both sides of the Atlantic by the Columbian
					Exchange continued to shape lives for centuries.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-634"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Cultural exchange</h4><p class="intro">New World peoples were using stone-age tools, and had no wheeled vehicles and
					few domesticated animals when they encountered Old World societies, who used
					guns and alphabets, farmed pigs, sheep, and cattle, and kept bees. The ensuing
					cultural changes, especially in the Americas, were further complicated by the
					two societies’ very different attitudes to the “ownership”
					of nature and property; attitudes that would have significant consequences for
					future Native American&ndash;European relations. The arrival of the horse led
					to the emergence of a new, nomadic Native American tribe that came to dominate
					the southern Great Plains. Christianity started to spread in the New World, some
					elements of which fused with pre-Columbian beliefs in the old Inca and Aztec
					territories. West African religion also arrived, while introductions such as
					literacy, and metal tools and machines, brought advances in education,
					agriculture, and the evolution of warfare.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre3">Christopher Columbus reaches America</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-67" class="calibre3">The Treaty of Tordesillas</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-68" class="calibre3">The voyage of the <i class="calibre5">Mayflower</i></a> • <a href="#calibre_link-19" class="calibre3">The Slave Trade Abolition Act</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				at the University of Wittenberg in Germany, set off a chain reaction that would
				transform Europe. Deeply concerned by what he saw as corrupt practices in the
				Catholic Church, he wrote a series of 95 theses &ndash; arguments &ndash; against
				them, which he then circulated within the university. According to some reports, he
				also nailed them to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The theses were
				soon published more widely, prompting Pope Leo X to charge Luther with heresy.
				Luther responded by breaking with the Catholic faith, so initiating the Reformation
				&ndash; the rise of churches based on reformed practices and a focus on scripture
				rather than on priestly authority. Because of the churches’ origin in
				protests against Catholic practices and beliefs, they became known as Protestant
				churches.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-637"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"Injury is done to the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal or larger

Swiss preacher Ulrich
					Zwingli (1484&ndash;1531) led a Protestant church based in Zurich, and
					Frenchman John Calvin broke from the Catholic church in around 1530. Forced to
					flee France, he went to Geneva, Switzerland, where he supported the reform
					movement, eventually helping to shape Protestant doctrine.</p><p class="calibre14">Reformers’ beliefs did not necessarily concur. Calvinists were markedly
					different from Lutherans, and Anabaptists were persecuted by Protestants as well
					as Catholics for their radical views. Luther himself supported the brutal
					suppression of the Anabaptist-led Peasants’ Revolt in the 1520s. What the
					Protestants had in common was that their views brought them into fundamental
					theological conflict with the Catholic church.</p><p class="calibre14">Reformers’ ideas spread via the relatively new technology of the
					printed word. Before movable type and presses made printed books possible in the
					1450s, books were all written by hand in Latin, the international language of
					the church. Print allowed information to be reproduced cheaply and quickly, and
					demand rapidly grew for books written in the vernacular. Luther wrote his theses
					in Latin, but before long they had been translated and printed in German,
					French, English, and other languages. Books and pamphlets describing church
					abuses and outlining Protestant theology soon followed, and were printed in
					large numbers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-639"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000370.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">At the Diet of Worms</span> in 1521, Luther
							refused to recant: “Unless I am convicted of error by the

					priesthood, but from scripture itself. For this reason, access to the Bible was
					essential both for the reformers and their followers. Bibles printed in native
					European languages were appearing by the 16th century, Luther’s German
					translation of the New Testament was published in 1522, and a translated version
					of the whole Bible including the Apocrypha followed in 1534. A year later, Miles
					Coverdale (1488&ndash;1569), sometime friar, preacher, and Bishop of Exeter,
					produced the first complete Bible in English. A French translation by theologian
					Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (c.1450&ndash;1536) appeared
					between 1528 and 1532.</p><p class="calibre14">By the mid-16th century, Reformation ideas had been widely disseminated.
					Lutheranism spread across Germany and Scandinavia; Calvinism took hold in much
					of Switzerland, and made significant inroads in Scotland. There were also
					Calvinists in France, where they were called Huguenots, although that country
					was split between Catholics and Protestants, who fought in the Wars of Religion
					of the second half of the 16th century. Spain, Portugal, and Italy remained
					Catholic.</p><p class="calibre14">In England, the seeds of reform were sown early. Many people objected to
					abuses such as the use of church funds to pay for clerics &ndash; including the
					Pope and foreign bishops &ndash; to lead a life of luxury. However, Protestant
					ideas were not yet widely enough held for the faith to take hold. Things changed
					when Henry VIII of England broke with Rome in 1534, rejecting papal authority
					and proclaiming himself head of the church in England. As supreme ecclesiastical
					leader, he exercised his sole right to authorize the publication of the English
					Bible, the Coverdale Bible, but English religious practice and doctrine remained
					Catholic. A moderate form of Protestantism was later established in England
					under Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I.</p><p class="calibre14">Reformers risked their lives by speaking out at a time when heresy was
					punishable by death. Czech reformer Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in
					1415, Zwingli died in a battle between Protestant and Catholic forces in 1531,
					and English Bible translator William Tyndale was executed in 1536. Luther, urged
					to recant by Pope Leo X in 1520, threw the written request on a bonfire, so
					church authorities handed him over to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony and
					founder of the University of Wittenberg, for punishment. Frederick convened a
					formal enquiry or “Diet” at Worms, at which Emperor Charles V
					presided. The emperor rejected Luther’s arguments and banned his views in
					the empire, but Luther refused to recant. He was outlawed and excommunicated,
					but Frederick saved him from execution by faking his abduction, then hiding him
					at the Wartburg castle. Luther continued to write and organize, garnering
					increasing support.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-641"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000346.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Cartoon images of the pope</span> as a bestial

					Reformation. Like Henry VIII in England, the princes of Germany resented church
					wealth, taxation, and its independent law courts, and were also eager to
					strengthen their own power. Throughout the Middle Ages, popes had made alliances
					with kings and emperors, and intervened in secular affairs. Many German princes
					wanted to prevent such alliances by cutting ties with Rome and removing bishops
					from their princedoms, so their support for the reformers was motivated by
					political expedience as well as personal piety.</p><p class="calibre14">In what would become the first in a long list of religiously motivated
					conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V
					invaded Lutheran territory in an effort to stamp out the movement. Lutherans
					united against him and, despite his triumph at the Battle of Mühlberg in
					1547, he was unable to suppress them. A temporary compromise was eventually
					reached at Augsburg in 1555 when the emperor conceded that each prince within
					the empire could choose how to worship in his own domain. The peace was not to

					the church. Inspired partly by Renaissance Humanism, it brought on a resurgence
					of scholarship and philosophy, and motivated churchmen such as Spaniard
					Francisco Ximenes, who produced a Bible with texts in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
					Aramaic. However, Luther’s clear theological challenges prompted the
					papacy to prepare a more widely considered response. In 1545, Paul III called
					together the Council of Trent at which bishops and cardinals reaffirmed Catholic
					doctrines, from the importance of the priesthood and sacraments to the
					legitimacy of indulgences. But the council also introduced reforms: it forbade
					abuses such as the holding of multiple offices by one priest, set up training
					seminaries for priests, and, in an attempt to slow the spread of Protestant
					doctrine, established a commission to specify which books Catholics were
					forbidden to read. In addition, a number of popes from Paul III onwards lived
					austerely, appointed like-minded bishops, and reviewed papal finances.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-645"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"Has the Catholic Church been dead for a thousand years to be revived only

					resurgence of Catholicism from within the church that is usually called the
					Counter-Reformation. The new Society of Jesus (also known as the order of
					Jesuits), founded by Spanish knight Ignatius Loyola in 1534, was approved by the
					pope in 1540 as an answer to the Reformation, and it spread a powerful
					Counter-Reformation message across Europe. The contemporary revival of Christian
					art, which coincided with the flowering of the baroque style in Italy, added a
					vibrant emphasis. Baroque churches were imposing and ornate, filled with
					affecting sculptures, paintings, and strikingly posed biblical scenes. This
					potent propaganda served to underline the difference between Catholic churches
					and their Protestant counterparts, which were usually plain and undecorated.
					Baroque art, together with the zeal of reforming popes and Jesuit priests,
					helped to ensure that the Catholic church survived and flourished in countries
					such as Italy and Spain, even while the Protestant movement was gathering
					strength elsewhere. Europe, which had once been united under the pope in the
					Roman Catholic Church, was now irrevocably split into Catholic and Protestant
					states. The seeds were sown for over a century of conflict as subjects took up
					arms against their rulers, kings and princes clashed, and nations attacked
					nations in the name of religion.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-648"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000299.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><em class="calibre19"><strong class="calibre25">The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</strong></em>, a

				councillors in an upper room in Prague Castle. The councillors were Catholics,
				working as regents for Ferdinand, the new king of Bohemia (now part of the Czech
				Republic); the Protestants wanted to be sure that the king and regents would not
				remove the religious freedoms that their former rulers had granted them. When the
				regents refused to give this assurance, the Protestants threw two of them, together
				with their clerk, out of the castle window. The trio landed some 20 metres below in
				a dung heap stacked against the castle walls. Known as the Defenestration of Prague,
				this event began the Thirty Years’ War, a series of conflicts that devastated
				huge areas of Europe.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-651"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000243.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Protestant nobles</span> threw the imperial

						Years’ War.</p></div></div><div id="calibre_link-652" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Religious differences</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Defenestration took place in the wake of long-standing disputes between
					Catholics and Protestants about whether people should be allowed to worship
					freely in their own way. These differences affected much of Europe, and before
					war ignited Bohemia there were violent religious conflicts in several other
					parts of the continent.</p><p class="calibre14">The disputes also involved rivalries for power between royal and aristocratic
					families who favoured the different sides and used the conflicts to promote
					their own interests. The Netherlands, for example, were home to many
					Protestants, but were ruled by Catholic Spain, whose ruler Philip II wanted to
					eliminate Protestantism. The largely Protestant Seven Provinces in the northern
					Low Countries revolted against the king’s rule. Religious clashes
					escalated into violence against the perceived repression of the Habsburg Crown,
					leading to the formation of the independent Dutch Republic in the north of the
					region.</p><p class="calibre14">Philip also planned to conquer England, which was moderately Protestant under
					Elizabeth I, and wanted to place a Catholic monarch on the English throne. In
					1588, he sent his famous Armada to invade the country, but a combination of
					superior English naval tactics and stormy weather foiled the attempt, and
					England remained independent.</p><p class="calibre14">These religious differences proved particularly devastating in 16th-century
					France, where the substantial Protestant minority generally known as the
					Huguenots were widely persecuted. Many Protestants, especially Calvinist
					ministers, had their tongues cut out, or were burned at the stake. In the
					so-called St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572, a group of targeted
					assassinations followed by a wave of mob violence against the Huguenots lasted
					several weeks and left thousands dead.</p><p class="calibre14">There followed a series of so-called Wars of Religion that lasted some 36
					years. After eight periods of fighting, punctuated by uneasy truces and broken
					agreements, the wars came to an end in 1598 when the French king Henry IV, who
					had been a Protestant leader before taking the throne, promulgated the Edict of
					Nantes. This agreement gave the Huguenots certain rights, including freedom of
					religion in particular geographical areas. It also maintained Catholicism as the
					established religion in France, and obliged Protestants to observe Catholic
					holidays and pay church taxes. Disputes between the two sides still flared from
					time to time, however, and many Huguenots left France to seek safety in other
					countries such as England and the Netherlands.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-653"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"I would rather lose all my lands and a hundred lives than be king over

					a troubled backdrop to the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. Most people in
					Bohemia were Protestants, but the area was part of the large Holy Roman Empire,
					which also included Germany, Austria, and Hungary, and was ruled by Catholic
					Habsburg emperors. The emperors acted as overlords to local kings, princes, and
					dukes. Some of them, notably Matthias, who was on the throne when the
					Defenestration took place, granted their Protestant subjects the right to
					worship as they wished. Matthias achieved this by ratifying the Letter of
					Majesty, a charter that had been signed by the previous emperor, Rudolf II,
					which guaranteed Protestants religious freedom and certain other basic rights.
					However, Matthias’ successor, the ardently Catholic Ferdinand, felt no
					obligation to honour the Letter of Majesty. He suppressed Protestant churches
					and appointed Catholics to high positions. This reignited a dispute that had
					existed in Bohemia since the first stirrings of the Protestant Reformation in
					the 15th century.</p><p class="calibre14">After the Defenestration, both sides began preparing for war, but the process
					was accelerated when, in 1619, Matthias died. Ferdinand, who was already King of
					Bohemia, then also became Holy Roman Emperor. Bohemia’s Protestant
					leaders tried to reduce the Catholic emperor’s local power by deposing
					him as King of Bohemia and inviting their own candidate, the Protestant
					Frederick V, Elector Palatine, to rule in his stead.</p><p class="calibre14">Frederick’s credentials as a Protestant were excellent, not only
					because of his own faith, but also by marriage: his wife was Elizabeth Stuart,
					daughter of England’s Protestant king James I. However, in order to make
					Frederick king, the Bohemians had to depose a monarch who had been legally
					crowned, a move that deprived them of support from a number of their potential
					allies.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1620, the forces of Bohemia gathered to face those of the Holy Roman Empire
					at White Mountain, outside Prague. The forces seemed evenly matched: the
					Protestants under Frederick and Christian of Anhalt had a larger force, but the
					empire’s soldiers were experienced and well led by the
					Spanish&ndash;Flemish nobleman Field Marshall Tilly, and renowned general
					Albrecht von Wallenstein. After only one hour, Bohemian forces were crushed
					&ndash; 4,000 dead or taken prisoner compared to 700 of the empire’s
					forces &ndash; and Tilly entered Prague. Frederick fled, and many of the
					Protestant leaders were executed; ordinary Protestants were ordered to leave or
					convert to Catholicism; and Bohemia was left devastated, depopulated, and almost
					powerless. The area remained overwhelmingly Catholic into the 20th
					century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-655"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000218.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-656" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A destabilizing reform</h2></div><p class="calibre15">What happened in Bohemia was a symptom of the instability of the wider Holy
					Roman Empire. In its history there had often been power struggles between
					emperors and local rulers, but a general balance of power had emerged in which
					the emperor resolved to respect the rights of the individual states that made up
					the empire. This balance was upset by the changes of the Reformation, when
					Protestant beliefs strengthened in some places (such as Saxony), and Catholicism
					prevailed in others (such as Bavaria). A series of struggles then escalated into
					armed conflict.</p><p class="calibre14">Most of the battles were in the German and central European lands. In a few
					years the Habsburg imperial army, raised for Ferdinand and led by skilled
					military leader Albrecht Wallenstein, had crushed its rivals in Germany, and
					gone on to overwhelm Denmark. By 1629, Ferdinand was in a position to reclaim
					the lands that had passed into Protestant hands.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the Protestants still had two powerful allies. One was Sweden, under
					King Gustavus Adolphus, an able military leader; the other was France, a
					Catholic country, but one that wanted to curtail imperial power. In 1630,
					Gustavus arrived in Germany with a large army and won a significant victory at
					Breitenfeld in 1631, with financial assistance from France.</p><p class="calibre14">In the mid-1630s the Habsburgs fought back, with the help of Spain. The
					conflict had now become an all-encompassing war involving virtually every one of
					Europe’s major countries in a struggle for power. The emperor wanted to
					win back his lands in Germany, while the Spanish wanted the Habsburgs, their
					allies, in power so that they could cross Europe with ease in their hoped-for
					attack on the Netherlands. France, fearful of being surrounded by the Habsburgs
					and their allies, continued to try to reduce imperial power.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-657"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"The [Protestant] wound is degenerated into gangrene; it requires fire and

France
					defeated Spain at Rocroi in the Oise valley in 1643, while in 1645, Sweden met
					the imperial army at Junkau, southeast of Prague. Around half the 16,000-strong
					imperial army was killed in this bloody battle, and it looked as if the Swedes
					would march on Prague or Vienna. However by this point, both sides were
					exhausted, and no advance was made on either city.</p><p class="calibre14">The battles of the Thirty Years’ War were conducted on a large scale.
					Forces of thousands came together in cavalry charges backed up by firearms, and
					large numbers of mercenaries were employed. The battles were fought with
					professional speed and ruthlessness, but what came after was sometimes even
					worse. Vast armies committed infamous atrocities as they pillaged huge areas of
					country to find food, and removed anything that might be useful to their
					enemies. Rural areas suffered particularly badly at the hands of the scavenging
					troops &ndash; Germany lost around 20 per cent of its population &ndash; but
					trade and manufacturing were also affected by the damage and devastation left
					behind. Central Europe took decades to recover from the war, although countries
					with strong trade networks and sea power, such as England and the Netherlands,
					fared better.</p><p class="calibre14">Repeated artillery battles also wore down both armies. Exhausted, the sides
					eventually came together to make peace. Representatives of the empire, Spain,
					France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic, as well as rulers of German princedoms
					and cities, and other interested parties, assembled in 1648 in two north-German
					cities, Osnabrück and Münster, to agree the Peace of Westphalia.
					The talks could not resolve basic differences between political and religious
					interests; they did however produce an agreement to end the war, and the Peace
					established an overall balance of power among a number of independent
					nations.</p><p class="calibre14">Although Europe was now permanently divided into states that were
					predominantly Catholic or predominantly Protestant, they had agreed to learn to
					coexist with one another. The Peace set the precedent of creating agreements
					between nations by means of high-level diplomatic meetings, the like of which
					have played a key part in international relations ever since.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-660"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000164.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">As different powers</span> intervened in the

				Central Asia. The emperor’s forces immediately confronted the army of Hemu, a
				rival claimant to the throne of Delhi, at the Second Battle of Panipat. The Mughals
				inflicted a crushing defeat on Hemu, and regained territory lost by Akbar’s
				father, Humayun. Akbar then gradually consolidated and extended his authority,
				annexing all of northern and part of central India. Rulers were deposed and killed
				and citizens massacred as once-independent kingdoms became provinces of his
				empire.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-663"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000116.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-664" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Support and survival</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Akbar maintained the political unity of his sprawling realm by building an
					administration capable of expansion as new territories were incorporated. He
					created a network of highly paid nobles who served as provincial governors, or
					were employed as commanders of field armies or as part of the central military
					&ndash; the backbone of the empire. He also recruited talented men from across
					India (and Persia), both Muslim and Hindu, into his government, remunerating
					them with money or land.</p><p class="calibre14">This system rewarded individual merit and loyalty, but kept the administration
					from becoming too centralized &ndash; a distinct advantage in an empire that
					was difficult to hold together from a single centre. The emperor himself was
					often on the move, travelling with his court and harem in well-appointed
					tents.</p><p class="calibre14">Another unifying factor was the spread of Islam, together with its arts and
					culture; however, Akbar believed in religious freedom and allowed the
					empire’s non-Muslim populations, which included a large Hindu majority,
					to live by their own faiths, laws, and customs.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-665"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000093.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In this miniature painting</span>, the Mughals

					had developed diplomatic, cultural, and political links with another Islamic
					empire in the region, Safavid Persia, which stimulated Mughal interest in
					Persian fine arts such as miniature painting and the “art of the
					book”. Akbar set up studios to produce illustrated books in the cities of
					Fatehpur Sikri and Lahore (now in Pakistan), and Persian architects and artisans
					were brought to India to design and construct palaces, forts, mosques, and
					public buildings, including Humayun’s tomb in Delhi. This domed structure
					inspired major architectural innovation, and a unique Persian-influenced
					building style developed across the Indian subcontinent.</p><p class="calibre14">The Mughal Empire continued to prosper under Akbar’s son Jahangir, but
					later in the 17th century it declined amid religious conflict and economic
					problems. The emperors were defeated by Afghan invaders, then came under the
					control of the Marathas, Hindu warriors who dominated Indian affairs in the
					second half of the 18th century, and finally were taken over by the British
					after Britain defeated the Marathas in 1818.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature9" id="calibre_link-667"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">AKBAR<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-668"><img alt="" src="images/000072.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Akbar was just 13 years old when he inherited the Mughal throne, and initially

					authority.</p><p class="calibre11">Under Akbar, the dynasty became an artistic as well as military power.
					Painting and literature blossomed under the emperor’s patronage &ndash;
					although he himself was illiterate, he acquired a library of 24,000 books. His
					capital at Fatehpur Sikri also became a centre for religious debate and his
					court a place of culture and learning. Although he never renounced Islam, Akbar
					was open to the ideas of other faiths, and he invited Hindu, Christian, and
					Buddhist philosophers to debate with the Muslim theologians at his court. He
					even conceived a new religion, which combined elements of all these faiths, with
					himself as the deity.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-28" class="calibre3">Muhammad receives the divine

					colonists elected officials to govern their own affairs. Inspired by the English
					parliamentary model, and growing out of the assertion of rights articulated in
					the <i class="calibre5">Mayflower Compact</i>, these early
					developments established a model of self-rule that came to characterize English
					colonization in North America.</p><p class="calibre14">Each colony had a governor, appointed by the British monarch, and a
					legislature, elected by the colonists. There was often tension between the two,
					because the legislature had to work within the framework of existing English
					law. However, the king and government in London, working with the governor, saw
					the colonies as a resource, rich in raw materials, that they could exploit to
					their advantage.</p><p class="calibre14">To ensure America remained a ready market for British industry, colonial trade
					was restricted by the Navigation Acts, which required that all commodity trade
					take place in British ships crewed by British sailors. The colonists came to see
					these measures as a wilful suppression of their trade and manufacturing.
					Tensions rose on both sides of the Atlantic as British and colonial merchants
					sought to protect their interests.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-675" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Colonial growth</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Relations between the colonists and the indigenous peoples of the East Coast
					were also starting to strain. The increasing colonial population put pressure on
					land and resources, pushing people west to settle on land belonging to American
					Indians.</p><p class="calibre14">The groups struggled to coexist harmoniously. An uneasy peace, punctuated by
					violence, typified relations between settlers and American Indians for many
					years.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-676"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Religious persecution</h4><p class="intro">In the early 17th century, the English were legally obliged to worship as
					prescribed by the Church of England. Although the English church had already
					broken from the Catholic Church, many people still felt that its hierarchical
					priesthood and set rituals, hymns, and prayers were Catholic features that
					should be swept away.</p><p class="calibre11">Puritans, so-called because of their desire for religious purity, hoped to
					reform the church from within. Other groups, known as Separatists, set up their
					own “separate” congregations, but when their leaders were
					imprisoned or even executed, they moved to the more tolerant Netherlands. Here
					they could adopt the simpler form of worship they preferred, but it was very
					hard to earn a living because the country’s professional guilds were
					closed to them. This is part of the reason that the Pilgrims, and later others,
					decided to seek a new life in North America.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre3">Christopher Columbus reaches America</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre3">The opening of the Amsterdam Stock

				to decide the future of the country and known collectively as the English Civil War.
				On one side were the Royalists &ndash; predominantly landed gentry and aristocrats
				who supported King Charles I and his right to rule independently of parliament. On
				the other were the Parliamentarians &ndash; mainly smaller landowners and
				tradesmen, many of whom held Puritan beliefs and disliked Charles’s
				autocratic stance. By 1648, the Parliamentarians had beaten Charles on the
				battlefield and Oliver Cromwell, their leader, ejected from parliament all those who
				were prepared to negotiate with the king, leaving the remainder (known as the Rump
				Parliament) to vote to end the monarchy. Charles was tried for treason against
				England and was beheaded in 1649, after which England began an 11-year period as a
				republic.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-679"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000303.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-680" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The causes of war</h2></div><p class="calibre15">King Charles I and parliament were natural opponents. Charles was sympathetic
					to Catholics while parliament was Protestant, and he believed in the divine
					right of kings &ndash; the idea that the monarch’s appointment is
					approved by God and so he or she has absolute power.</p><p class="calibre14">The clash first came to a head over the king’s repeated attempts to
					raise money for a war in France. Parliament tried to curb his power to do so by
					introducing a Petition of Right in 1628, making it a necessity for its members
					to approve taxation. However, Charles got round this by levying taxes using
					antiquated medieval laws, selling trading monopolies to raise cash, and ruling
					without parliament. In 1640 the king was forced to call parliament for the first
					time in 11 years to raise money to quell a Scottish revolt. Once called,
					parliament tried to bring in further measures to limit his power, such as making
					it illegal for the king to dissolve parliament, but he responded by trying to
					arrest five MPs. The dispute escalated into the First Civil War in 1642.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-681" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The war and its effects</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Initially, the Royalists gained the upper hand but in 1644 the
					Parliamentarians reorganized their troops under Oliver Cromwell. With their
					disciplined, professional approach, this “New Model Army” forced
					Charles to surrender in 1646. However, the king restarted the war two years
					later, and this Second Civil War &ndash; which ended in a Royalist defeat at
					the Battle of Preston in 1648 &ndash; began the chain of events that led to his
					execution in 1649 and the formation of a republic under Cromwell called the
					Commonwealth of England.</p><p class="calibre14">Like Charles, Cromwell found relations with parliament difficult, but he tried
					to bring in reforms. He ruled with stern Puritan authority, imposing it
					ruthlessly on the Scots and the Irish. Soon after he died, the country &ndash;
					perhaps tired of Puritan austerity &ndash; welcomed Charles I’s exiled
					son home to reign. Charles II agreed to limitations on royal power and to uphold
					the Protestant faith, but his heir &ndash; his Catholic brother James II
					&ndash; clashed with Anglican bishops and offended Protestants by offering
					prominent positions to Catholics.</p><p class="calibre14">Fears of having another Catholic king mounted until, in 1688, in what became
					known as the Glorious Revolution, James was deposed. The king was sent into
					exile and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary, who ruled with her Dutch
					husband William of Orange. In 1689, William and Mary accepted a Bill of Rights,
					which ensured their subjects had basic civil liberties, such as trial by jury,
					and making the monarchy subject to the law of the land. Britain has remained a
					constitutional monarchy, in which no king or queen could defy Parliament as
					Charles I did, ever since.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-682"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">KING CHARLES I OF ENGLAND<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-683"><img alt="" src="images/000332.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">The son of Stuart King James I of England (King James VI of Scotland) and Anne
					of Denmark, Charles was born in 1600 and became king in 1625. From the start, he
					alienated both subjects and parliament with his demands for taxation (mostly to
					fund wars in France) and his assertion of his divine right to rule. He also
					clashed with the church because of his sympathies with Catholicism (he was
					married to the French Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria). In addition, he was
					unpopular in Scotland, where he tried to replace the prevailing presbyterian
					system of church governance (without bishops) with the more hierarchical
					episcopal system (with bishops, following the Anglican model), which led to
					political and military conflict in 1639 and 1640 (known as the Bishops’
					War). During the English Civil War, he took an active part in leading the
					Royalist armies until he was captured; initially, he was put under house arrest,
					then he was imprisoned before his execution in 1649. He continued to assert his
					divine right to rule during his trial.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-119" class="calibre3">The signing of the Magna Carta</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-75" class="calibre3">Martin Luther’s 95 theses</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-98" class="calibre3">The Defenestration of Prague</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre3">The opening of the Amsterdam Stock

				Twelve years later, the company was reorganized as the Royal African Company and
				given still greater powers: to build forts and “factories” (where
				slaves were held before being shipped over the Atlantic), and employ its own troops.
				The company’s particular significance is due to its crucial role in
				facilitating and developing the slave trade. It transported many thousands of
				Africans to a life of slavery, working with West African leaders to build a trade
				that lasted even after the company disbanded in 1752, and that would eventually see
				millions of Africans displaced to lives of toil in the Americas.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-686"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"I herded them as if they had been cattle towards the boats."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Diogo Gomes <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">Portuguese explorer (1458)</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-687"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000274.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Atlantic slave trade</span> was banned from

					War, a trade conflict between the Netherlands and England during which the Dutch
					took many English forts, excluding them from the slave trade during the war.
					Involvement in the war almost brought the Company of Royal Adventurers to
					bankruptcy, but in 1672, with a new charter from the king, the company
					re-emerged, renamed, re-structured, and granted the right to carry slaves for
					sale in the Americas. It prospered, transporting some 100,000 slaves between
					that year and 1698 when, royal power having been restricted by the Bill of
					Rights, the company lost its monopoly over the trade. After 1698, other
					merchants were allowed to join the trade but had to pay a levy to the company of
					10 per cent on all their African exports. The involvement of other merchants
					strengthened the trade to the point that it became part of the fabric of British
					mercantile life, continuing throughout the 18th century.</p><p class="calibre14">The slave trade itself was much older than the Royal African Company.
					Portuguese traders in the late 14th century were the first Europeans to ship
					slaves from West Africa. By the 16th century, the Portuguese were bringing slaves
					in huge numbers to Brazil to work on sugar cane plantations. Brazil remained the
					biggest destination for the import of African slaves until the outlawing of the
					trade. The first English slaving expeditions took place in the 1560s, in which
					merchants bought captured slaves from African rulers. During the 17th century,
					with the increase of English colonization, the market for African slaves grew
					and the Royal African Company took full advantage of it.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-689"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000248.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-690" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Triangular trade</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The transatlantic slave trade soon became part of a larger triangular trading
					network, in which ships took slaves from Africa to the Americas; refilled the
					holds with goods to transport to Europe; then took European manufactured goods
					on to Africa for sale, completing the triangle. Ships carried commodities such
					as sugar, molasses, and coffee from the Caribbean to England; rice, indigo,
					cotton, and tobacco from the southern colonies in North America; and furs,
					timber, and rum from the northeast. On the England-to-Africa leg, they carried a
					range of items including cloth, guns, iron, and beer. Goods such as ivory and
					gold were carried directly from Africa to Europe, not as part of the triangular
					trade but still bolstering the system.</p><p class="calibre14">The trade network brought huge profits to plantation owners in the Americas,
					and to English manufacturers, as well as to the merchants who dealt in the
					slaves and other goods. Port operators, West African leaders who sold slaves,
					bankers who loaned money for expeditions, and even English factory workers whose
					jobs depended on raw materials imported from abroad, all benefitted.</p><p class="calibre14">As a key part of this trading network, the slave trade made possible the rapid
					rise of Western capitalism in the 18th century. Even factories some distance
					away from England’s trading ports became involved. A notable example was
					the business of arms manufacture, which was based in the English Midlands at
					population centres such as Birmingham, conveniently close to supplies of iron.
					Some 150,000 guns, mostly made in these Midland factories, were exported to West
					Africa every year; almost all of them were then exchanged with African merchants
					for slaves. English cutlery from Birmingham and Sheffield was also traded in the
					same way. So many people had vested interests in the triangular trade that it
					became difficult for European politicians even to criticize the system, let
					alone abolish it.</p><p class="calibre14">The number of people who were enslaved and traded was vast. It has been
					estimated that by the time the slave trade was outlawed in Britain in 1807,
					British merchants had forced some 3 million Africans into lives of slavery in
					the Americas. Unknown numbers of people did not even reach America, but died en
					route in the appalling conditions on board the slave ships. It is likely that
					even more were carried by Portuguese traders bound for Brazil; ships from other
					nations carried smaller numbers. Some historians have estimated the total number
					at around 10 million; others put the figure still higher.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-691"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000200.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The triangular slave trade</span> turned
							misery for some into wealth for others. While the profits it generated
							accelerated the development of European economies, the trade also
							displaced millions of Africans.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-692" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">European colonies</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Spanish, Dutch, and French settlers pioneered the plantation system in the
					Caribbean, producing crops such as sugar and coffee on huge farms, or
					plantations. Their principal Caribbean colonies included Cuba (a colony of
					Spain), Haiti (France) and the Dutch Antilles (the Netherlands). The use of
					slave labour on these plantations generated substantial profits for owners. The
					British presence in the area increased in the 17th century, when
					Britain’s most successful colony was Barbados, where there were 46,000
					slaves by the 1680s. In the 18th century there was also a sugar boom in
					Jamaica.</p><p class="calibre14">Most of the native populations were wiped out in the European conquests, and
					European workers did not fare well in the local conditions, so plantation owners
					increasingly relied on merciless exploitation of slaves. Slavery was also
					prevalent in the colonies of North America, especially the southern areas where
					crops such as tobacco were grown on plantations. Slaves were often treated as
					non-human objects, forced into labour and subjected to cruelties such as
					beating, branding, and worse.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-693"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000226.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Tobacco from Virginia</span> was in great
							demand in Europe. Planters shipped their products directly to their home
							countries and used the profits to buy African labour and European
							goods.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-694" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Slavery beyond the triangle</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Colonists from Europe also practised slavery beyond the Atlantic trading
					triangle. The Dutch pioneered slave trading in Southeast Asia, and also traded
					across the Indian Ocean with areas such as Madagascar and Mauritius. Most of
					this trading was conducted under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company,
					which had its eastern headquarters on the island of Jakarta, known to the Dutch
					as Batavia, as well as a base in Sri Lanka. From these points they sent slaves
					around the Indian Ocean, from eastern Indonesia to southern Africa. Once the
					Portuguese and English had set up bases, there was also further slave trading
					along the Indian coast.</p><p class="calibre14">The slave trade was not solely carried out by Europeans. Muslim merchants also
					transported slaves from East Africa for sale elsewhere in the Muslim
					world.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the triangular trade was a crucial element in the creation of a
					global economy run by Europeans and their colonial offshoots for their own
					profits. It permitted a phenomenal growth in the wealth of countries that ran
					the trade. In Britain, for example, the value of foreign trade rose from
					£10 million at the beginning of the 18th century to £40 million at
					the end. But the human cost of the trade in slaves, which influenced patterns of
					thought and behaviour for centuries to come, remains incalculable today.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-695"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole

				the Dutch East India Company (known in the Netherlands as VOC). The company was a
				vast enterprise &ndash; in effect, the first international corporation &ndash; and
				it was created to facilitate trading expeditions to Asia. Unusually, the Dutch
				government had granted the company the power not only to trade, but also to build
				fortifications, establish settlements, raise armies, and enter into treaties with
				foreign rulers. Since the organization had a huge network of ships, ports, and
				personnel, it required considerable funding and many investors. The Amsterdam Stock

					involved in a long war with Spain. The northern part of the region (the Dutch
					Republic, which was Protestant) had split from the southern half (Flanders,
					which was Catholic) in the late 16th century. The Republic consisted of seven
					separate northern provinces, each with a great deal of independence but under
					the umbrella of a federal government called the States-General. Protestant
					merchants who had lived in Catholic cities, such as Antwerp, moved north to
					escape persecution, taking with them their capital and trading links. Also, many
					Flemish artisans who were skilled in textile production (primarily weaving wool,
					silk, and linen) emigrated to the northern cities of Haarlem, Leiden, and
					Amsterdam, boosting the Dutch Republic’s economy further.</p><p class="calibre14">As the 17th century progressed, the Republic really began to prosper. Various
					factors came together to make this small region successful. Most importantly,
					the nation had a strong tradition of seafaring, giving it a huge advantage over
					many other countries. In addition, its citizens had a strong work ethic &ndash;
					largely due to the Protestant belief that worldly work was a duty and a route to
					salvation &ndash; so productivity was high. There was also a growing population
					(especially of the urban middle classes) and an expanding major city &ndash;
					Amsterdam &ndash; which proved an ideal centre for trade. All of these
					contributing factors resulted in the Dutch economy moving increasingly towards
					shipping, trading, and finance.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-700" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Exploration and trade</h2></div><p class="calibre15">As a coastal nation, the Dutch Republic produced notable sailors and
					explorers, so long-distance trading was a natural consequence of the
					country’s maritime history. In addition, advancements in ship-building
					technology in the Republic enabled the Dutch merchant fleet to expand rapidly;
					by 1670, the Dutch had more merchant ships than the rest of Europe put
					together.</p><p class="calibre14">The expanding merchant class saw large potential profits in the spice trade
					with Asia and, as in other maritime cultures such as Spain and Portugal,
					navigators sought new sea routes to the east. The Dutch travelled all over the
					globe and set up colonies, including one in North America: New Amsterdam, which
					they officially settled in 1624 and was renamed New York when the British took
					over. In 1596, the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz tried to find a northern
					passage to Asia and in the process discovered Svalbard (Spitsbergen), which
					later became a destination for Dutch whalers.</p><p class="calibre14">Most importantly for their prosperity, from 1595 the Dutch began to make
					regular journeys to Southeast Asia to trade in spices, particularly pepper,
					nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. They established colonies in the region and
					founded the city of Batavia, later renamed Jakarta. With this permanent base,
					the Dutch had the ability to trade long term, producing a massive boost to their
					economy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-701"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000121.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Batavia was the headquarters</span> of the

					Dutch economy, at the same time investment was required to cover the
					considerable costs of overseas expeditions. A trading voyage to Asia in the 17th
					century was a very risky venture &ndash; the potential profits were high, but
					storms at sea, pirates, warfare, or an accident could lead to the loss of a
					ship, crew, or cargo and wipe out all the profits. It therefore made sense for
					many people to invest in each voyage and spread the risk, rather than one entity
					shouldering all the costs and responsibilities. Private trading companies were
					set up, each investing a small amount in a larger whole, and all being well they
					would then receive a commensurate share of the profits.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-703" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Birth of the Exchange</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In 1602, these trading companies merged to form the Dutch East India Company,
					and shares in the enterprise were allocated at the new Stock Exchange in
					Amsterdam. It was established at the outset that the owners could buy and sell
					these shares, and very quickly other companies were listing their own shares on
					the Stock Exchange in order to raise money. The ease of buying and selling
					shares meant that the Stock Exchange became very busy indeed, fuelling the
					growth of capitalism in this part of Europe; increased investment resulted in
					more industry, which then led to further investment and the generation of
					greater wealth.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-704"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"If one were to lead a stranger through the streets of Amsterdam and ask

					securities &ndash; tradable financial assets such as shares &ndash; already
					had a long history in Europe. By the 14th century, possibly earlier, merchants
					in rich Italian trading cities, such as Venice and Genoa, had traded in
					securities. However, the prevailing conditions in the Netherlands in the 17th
					century meant that the market was especially buoyant. Since the 16th century,
					there had been a strong financial market in Amsterdam, where there was a
					tradition of trading in commodities and speculation in everything from whale oil
					to tulips. The idea of buying and selling shares therefore appealed in this
					entrepreneurial society, especially as there was a good prospect of healthy
					profits from the Asian trade. In addition, the unique way in which the exchange
					traded &ndash; opening for limited hours only &ndash; encouraged rapid buying
					and selling and produced a very fluid market.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-706" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Boosts to the economy</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The opening of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was followed in 1609 by the
					foundation of the Bank of Amsterdam &ndash; the forerunner of modern national
					banks. The bank provided a secure place to keep money and bullion, and it
					assured that local currency kept its value. It thus helped to make the Dutch
					Republic more financially secure, underpinning the vigorous and often risky
					trading activity that went on in this burgeoning market.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1623, the market had a further boost when the Dutch East India Company
					negotiated a new charter, paying investors a regular dividend and permitting
					those who wanted to leave the company to sell their shares on the Stock
					Exchange. This action further increased trade on the Stock Market, which was
					also pioneering other lucrative activities such as futures trading.</p><p class="calibre14">The insurance business was also thriving in Amsterdam during this time
					&ndash; particularly marine insurance, which had been created in the 16th
					century to protect ship owners and investors against the risks of long-distance
					voyages. When the Stock Exchange opened, a special area was set aside for the
					buying and selling of insurance.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-707"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000342.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-708" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A flourishing culture</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The very buoyant financial activity prevalent in Amsterdam in the 17th century
					encouraged the expanding middle classes to buy consumer goods, including fine
					furniture and oil paintings, further fuelling the economy of this already
					successful region. A particularly strong art market developed, allowing major
					painters &ndash; such as Vermeer and Rembrandt, as well as numerous lesser
					followers &ndash; to flourish. Many artists were specialists, satisfying a
					growing demand for portraits, landscapes, seascapes, and still lifes, although
					great artists like Rembrandt excelled in all genres and art forms, including
					painting, drawing, and printmaking.</p><p class="calibre14">The increasing wealth also led to the expansion of towns, with new town halls,
					warehouses, and merchants’ homes springing up. Numerous brick houses,
					owned by the middle classes, survive in cities such as Amsterdam and Delft, many
					of them set on the banks of the canals that were built during this period
					&ndash; a time of economic boom that combined elegance and artistic flair with
					success in trade.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature10" id="calibre_link-709"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Agricultural revolution</h4><p class="intro">The expanding population of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century encouraged
					farmers to make agriculture much more productive. In large part, this was
					achieved through continued land reclamation &ndash; a process that was already
					well underway by the late Middle Ages. The Dutch also changed the way they used
					their land. Instead of growing grain one year and letting the land lie fallow
					the next, farmers began planting certain nitrogen-producing crops (such as peas,
					turnips, and clover, which they could use as animal feed), in order to improve
					the soil ready for the next corn crop. Growing more fodder meant that farmers
					could keep larger herds, thereby increasing production of meat and milk as well
					as manure, which could be used as fertilizer. This greater productivity helped
					to sustain a growing population, although some wheat still had to be imported to
					make up the shortfall. It also freed up larger segments of the population to
					work in trade or finance rather than agriculture.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre3">Christopher Columbus reaches America</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-67" class="calibre3">The Treaty of Tordesillas</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-98" class="calibre3">The Defenestration of Prague</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-63" class="calibre3">Stephenson’s <i class="calibre5">Rocket</i> enters service</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-84" class="calibre3">The construction of the Suez Canal</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				the leadership of the lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, won a decisive victory. Three years
				later, the Emperor of Japan awarded Ieyasu the title of shogun, granting him the
				power to rule the country on the emperor’s behalf. Ieyasu brought stability
				and peace to Japan and transferred the nation’s capital to Edo (now Tokyo),
				creating a new focus for Japanese culture as well as a central power base.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-712"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000053.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-713" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Factional struggles</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Since 1192, the Emperor of Japan had been little more than a figure-head. He
					delegated power to the shogun: a hereditary, high-ranking military commander who
					ruled with absolute authority. However, by the 1460s the local feudal lords
						(<i class="calibre5">daimyos</i>) were so powerful that few
					shoguns had control over them, as they and their armies of samurai warriors
					fought to win the right to appoint the shogun’s successor. By the time of
					the Battle of Sekigahara, Japan had endured bitter factional struggles between
					its ruling classes for over a century.</p><p class="calibre14">Ieyasu’s victory at the battle put an end to this Warring States
					Period. His steady rule, followed by that of the Tokugawa shoguns who succeeded
					him, ushered in a 250-year period of stability.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-714" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Tokugawa shoguns</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In many respects, the Tokugawa shoguns modelled themselves on earlier rulers
					&ndash; particularly Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Although he was not sufficiently
					high-born to become a shogun, Hideyoshi (who ruled under the lesser title of
					imperial regent) had brought unity to Japan in the 1580s by imposing a military,
					feudal style of rule whereby he wielded great power through the daimyos and
					their samurai warriors. The Tokugawa shoguns decided to govern in the same way,
					with the daimyos keeping order in their local areas. As an extra precaution,
					Ieyasu made the daimyos spend alternate years in Edo to ensure they would not
					build up local power bases; he also suppressed rivals ruthlessly.</p><p class="calibre14">The shoguns encouraged an ethic of loyalty and developed an elite bureaucracy.
					They improved Japan’s road network, promoted education, and standardized
					the currency. The shogunate also tried to reduce foreign influence in Japan by
					expelling foreigners and limiting contact with the outside world. Exceptions
					were made for strictly controlled trade with the Chinese, Koreans, and the Dutch
					East India Company; all other Europeans were distrusted, as the shoguns believed
					that they had plans to convert the Japanese to Christianity and gain political
					power. Furthermore, the Japanese people were forbidden to travel and build
					ocean-going ships. This policy of isolation virtually cut off Japan from Western
					influence until the mid-19th century.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-715" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The “floating world”</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The capital Edo became the centre of a thriving urban culture during the
					Tokugawa shogunate. Japanese literary forms, such as the <i class="calibre5">haiku</i> (a short poem consisting of three lines and 17 syllables)
					flourished, as did the distinctive theatrical forms of <i class="calibre5">kabuki</i> (which combines theatre and dance) and the <i class="calibre5">bunraku</i> puppetry theatre. It was also a time of
					major achievements in the visual arts, particularly landscape painting and
					woodblock printing.</p><p class="calibre14">The capital’s elite became increasingly hedonistic, with their
					lifestyle frequently described as the “floating world” (<i class="calibre5">ukiyo</i>). Originally, Buddhists had used the term
						<i class="calibre5">ukiyo</i> to mean “sorrowful
					world”, reflecting their opinion that life on earth was transitory and
					expressing a desire to reach a more permanent place, free from suffering and all
					earthly desires. However, in the Edo Period the homonym <i class="calibre5">ukiyo</i> (“floating”) was used to describe the joyful
					aspect of the ephemeral material world, reflecting the pleasure-seeking mood of
					the day.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-716"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">TOKUGAWA IEYASU<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-717"><img alt="" src="images/000029.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">The samurai leader Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542&ndash;1616) was the son of a minor
					Japanese warlord from Mikawa in central Japan. As a young man, he received a

					Nobunaga (1534&ndash;82) &ndash; one of the most brutal leaders of the
					turbulent Warring States Period in Japan &ndash; and his successor, Toyotomi
					Hideyoshi (1536&ndash;98). Working with Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, Ieyasu not only
					built up large personal landholdings, but he also learnt the key values of
					loyalty and military power that enabled Hideyoshi to bring a brief period of
					unity to Japan. When Hideyoshi died, Ieyasu rose to the fore. As shogun, he was
					able to impose stability on his country, but he formally abdicated after only
					two years in favour of his son, Hidetada, to secure a smooth succession and
					establish a pattern of shoguns passing on their office, helping to ensure that
					the Tokugawa shogunate was long lasting. Although Hidetada had officially become
					shogun, Ieyasu remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-51" class="calibre3">Minamoto Yoritomo becomes Shogun</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre3">The opening of the Amsterdam Stock

				from the crumbling Ming regime and established their own dynasty, the Qing, as the
				rulers of northern China. Seventeen years later, after fierce fighting on an epic
				scale, the Qing had overcome the determined resistance of Ming loyalists, and
				extended their power across mainland China. However, their dynasty was still not
				secure &ndash; in 1673, Kangxi, the second emperor, was forced to confront a major
				uprising, which became known as the Revolt of the Three Feudatories.</p><p class="calibre14">The Three Feudatories were vast areas of south China that had been granted as
				semi-independent fiefdoms to three turncoat Ming generals who had assisted the Qing
				in their conquest of China. Over time, the fiefdoms became increasingly autonomous,
				but when Kangxi declared that they would not be hereditary, the generals rebelled.
				The ensuing struggle was hugely costly in terms of loss of life and economic
				disruption, and for a while, it seemed that one general, Wu Sangui, would topple the
				Qing. However, he was finally defeated by Kangxi’s supporters, and in 1683,
				the Qing eliminated the last stronghold of Ming support on Taiwan, which they then
				occupied.</p><p class="calibre14">With the Qing now undisputed rulers of China, Kangxi embarked on military
				campaigns that added parts of Siberia and Mongolia to the Chinese empire, and
				extended its control over Tibet. Under his exceptional leadership, and that of his
				two immediate successors, China enjoyed a golden age of peace, economic prosperity,
				and political stability that lasted until the late 18th century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-720"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000385.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Qianlong employed</span> the Italian Jesuit

					government and the bureaucracy and increased state revenues by reforming the tax
					system, and Qianlong (1735&ndash;96), under whom the empire’s borders
					reached their greatest extent and the population boomed. Qianlong was an avid

					were required to wear the Manchu hairstyle, in which the front and sides of the
					head were shaved, and the remaining hair plaited into a braid; society was
					rigidly hierarchical, and there were strict conventions regarding the conduct of
					women, laws against homosexuality, and censorship. Yet the country’s
					economy grew substantially in the early part of the Qing period, thanks to a
					strong demand in the West for luxury products such as silk, porcelain, and
					tea.</p><p class="calibre14">However, by the beginning of the 19th century, the regime’s repressive
					treatment of the Han Chinese people, together with famine and widespread
					addiction to opium &ndash; which had been brought into China by European

					astronomy, and it was a Jesuit who made the first accurate map of
					Beijing.</p><p class="calibre11">Kangxi gave Catholics freedom of worship in China, and the Jesuits allowed

				Louis XIV of France declared that he would now rule alone, as an absolute monarch.
				During his 72-year reign (1643&ndash;1715), Louis dominated his subjects,
				cultivating the image of a “Sun King” around whom the country orbited.
				Louis saw his power as God-given, and himself as the embodiment of the state, with
				the nobility, the middle classes, and peasants dependent on him for justice and
				protection.</p><p class="calibre14">To maintain this position, Louis controlled the historically unruly aristocracy.
				He compelled them to attend his court, where he dispensed privileges and positions
				via a system of etiquette. He filled the treasury’s depleted coffers by
				appointing members of the upper-middle classes to collect taxes in the provinces.
				Taxation was extensive and the burden fell mainly on the peasantry. Louis’s
				finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose overhaul of France’s trade and
				industry helped to make the country Europe’s leading power, increased the
				efficiency of the revenue system.</p><div id="calibre_link-735" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Expanding France</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Louis’s tax income paid for his court at the dazzling Palace of
					Versailles, an old hunting lodge extended into a royal palace, and the venue for
					extravagant entertainments. From 1682 it became the permanent base of the royal
					court, and the seat of government. Louis also waged a series of costly dynastic
					wars to make some territorial gains along France’s frontiers, leading the
					other European nations to form coalitions against him.</p><p class="calibre14">Peace was finally achieved at the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but brought few
					gains for France. The country was plunged into debt and opinion turned against
					the Crown. In spite of this, Louis established a pattern of absolutism in France
					that lasted, in a more enlightened form, for most of the 18th century until
					attempts to reform the system resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792
					during the French Revolution.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre3">The execution of Charles I</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-83" class="calibre3">Diderot publishes the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i></a> • <a href="#calibre_link-22" class="calibre3">The storming of the Bastille</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre3">The Battle of Waterloo</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				some of his country’s leading intellectuals &ndash; literary men,
				scientists, scholars, and philosophers to write articles for a huge
				“Classified Dictionary of Sciences, Arts, and Trades”, for which he
				was both editor-in-chief and contributor. The first volumes of his <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> appeared in 1751, and the full work
				was completed 21 years later, made up of 17 volumes of text and a further 11 volumes
				of illustrations.</p><p class="calibre14">The <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> was not the first large
				encyclopaedia to be published, but it was the first to feature content by named
				authors, and to give close attention to the trades and crafts. Its most striking
				feature, however, was its critical approach to contemporary ideas and institutions:
				its authors were champions of scientific thought and secular values. They sought to
				apply reason and logic to explain the phenomena of the natural world, and
				humankind’s existence, rather than religious or political dogma. As such, the
				work challenged both the Catholic Church and the French monarchy, which derived
				their authority from traditional ideas such as a divinely ordained, unchanging
				order.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-742"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000206.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-743" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A revolution in thought</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The mission of the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> was
					to catalogue the collective knowledge of the Western world in the spirit of the
					Enlightenment. This was a multifaceted intellectual movement that took root
					around 1715, though its origins lay in work done by the pioneers of modern
					scientific and philosophical thought in the previous century. The work’s
					multidisciplinary articles, which numbered around 72,000, distilled the ideas
					and theories of France’s key Enlightenment thinkers &ndash; including
					the writers and philosophers Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and
					Montesquieu.</p><p class="calibre14">The articles were extremely wide-ranging, but centred on three main areas: the
					need to base society not on faith and the doctrines of the Catholic Church but
					on rational thought; the importance of observations and experiments in science;
					and the search for a way of organizing states and governments around natural law
					and justice.</p><p class="calibre14">Diderot organized the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i>’s articles into three main categories:
					memory (subjects connected to history); reason (philosophy); and imagination
					(poetry). Controversially, there was no special category for God or the divine
					&ndash; religion, like magic and superstition, was treated as part of
					philosophy. This approach was groundbreaking, and contentious. Religion had been
					at the very heart of life and thought in Europe for centuries: the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie,</i> and the Enlightenment itself,
					denied it this key position.</p><p class="calibre14">In spite of repeated efforts by the authorities to censor some of its
					articles, and to intimidate and threaten its editors, the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> became the most influential and
					widely consulted work of the period. The ideas that it transmitted inspired the
					revolutions that exploded in France and the US at the end of the 18th
					century.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-744"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"Dare to know! Have courage to use your own reason!"</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Immanuel Kant <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">“What is Enlightenment?”

					reason and scepticism of accepted knowledge. This marked a break from earlier
					generations in which beliefs about the world derived from religious teachings
					and the doctrines of the Church. These governed everything from the laws of
					marriage to the way people understood the movement of the planets and the
					creation of the universe. For Enlightenment thinkers, however, the evidence of a
					person’s senses and the use of one’s reason was far more important
					than their blind adherence to a faith. They argued that “truths”
					about the tangible world, which had been set down in antiquity by Aristotle and
					others, and upheld by the Church, should be tested through experimentation and
					observation, checked, and then discussed in a rational way.</p><p class="calibre14">This radical mode of thinking had its origins in the scientific revolution of
					the 17th century. Scientists and philosophers including Francis Bacon, Johannes
					Kepler, Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei had transformed the study of nature
					and the physical universe, making it more observational. They conducted careful
					experiments and subjected their results to mathematical analysis; in the process
					they drastically updated and expanded the fields of physics, chemistry, biology,
					and astronomy.</p><p class="calibre14">Enlightenment scientists took this investigation of reality further, making
					possible, for example, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus’s development of a
					proper, rational biological classification in the early 18th century. The
					enquiring, reason-based approach of the Enlightenment also triggered dramatic
					technological advances. In the 1760s, the Scottish physician Joseph Black
					discovered carbon dioxide, while in 1769, Scotsman James Watt made improvements
					to the steam engine that increased its efficiency, thereby enabling the
					improvement of factories. The <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> helped to publicize these, and other,
					achievements of 18th-century scientists, as well as those of their
					precursors.</p><p class="calibre14">The work also found an audience in the learned societies, academies, and
					universities that flourished in the Enlightenment period. Although many teachers
					and scholars at Europe’s older, Church-dominated universities remained
					deaf to the new scientific way of thought, more progressive ones helped to teach
					and promote it.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-746"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"In all the ages of the world, priests have been the enemies of

					that reason could reveal natural laws in human affairs. Instead of drawing fact
					from faith, Enlightenment thinkers believed that politics should be separated
					from religion, that neither should curtail the rights of the individual, and
					that people should be free to express their opinions, worship in their own way,
					and read what they want to. This political doctrine, which is often labelled
					liberalism, had roots in the work of 17th-century philosophers such as
					Englishman John Locke &ndash; the father of liberalism. Locke asserted that
					there are certain intrinsic human rights that are not dependent on law or custom
					&ndash; in other words, they exist quite separately from what the Church or
					monarch might decree. These rights could be expressed in different ways, but
					included the right to life, the right to liberty, and the freedom to own what
					one has produced. These ideas were central to Enlightenment thinkers, following
					Locke, who felt that such natural rights should form the basis of any system of
					government.</p><p class="calibre14">Liberal ideas also found expression in the work of Enlightenment writers. For
					example, Voltaire, in books such as the <i class="calibre5">Philosophical
						Dictionary,</i> highlighted the injustices and abuses of the Catholic
					Church, and espoused values such as tolerance, freedom of the press, and the
					promotion of reason over doctrine and religious revelation. In his <i class="calibre5">Spirit of the Law</i>s, Montesquieu advocated the
					separation of governmental powers (legislature, executive, judiciary) and
					pressed for an end to slavery. In <i class="calibre5">The Social
						Contract</i>, Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the power of the monarch
					in favour of that of the people, who, he said, must balance rights with duties,
					and should be able to decide the laws that govern their lives. The contributors
					to the <i class="calibre5">Encyclopédie</i> also promoted
					liberal values in economics. They were critical of fairs &ndash; where goods
					were sold by visiting dealers at the expense of local traders, who often had to
					close their businesses for the duration &ndash; and favoured markets, which
					allowed local traders to meet the needs of the local population.</p><p class="calibre14">Ideas such as these spread across Europe. Conversations and debates on
					philosophical, political, and scientific subjects took place in the
					coffee-houses that had sprung up in English, French, German, and Dutch cities a
					century earlier. These coffee-houses now served as information-sharing hubs
					where men from all walks of life, including writers, politicians, philosophers,
					and scientists, could congregate to exchange views.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-749"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"Scepticism is the first step towards truth."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Denis Diderot <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Philosophical Thoughts</i>

					a profound impact on social, political, and intellectual life. Its proponents
					believed that they were sweeping away an oppressive medieval worldview and
					ushering in a new era that they hoped would be characterized by freedom of
					thought, open-mindedness, and tolerance.</p><p class="calibre14">The Enlightenment’s questioning, rational approach, and urgent demand
					for liberty, paved the way for the granting of new civil rights. The movement
					affected the policies of monarchical rulers, such as the freeing of serfs in the
					Holy Roman Empire in the 1780s. Monarchs who accepted Enlightenment values took
					on the movement’s name, titling themselves Enlightened Despots.
					Enlightenment thought also provided the intellectual fuel for the French
					Revolution of 1787&ndash;99 &ndash; begun by citizens inspired by
					Enlightenment notions of individual freedom and equality &ndash; and the
					campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade in the 19th century.</p><p class="calibre14">Liberalism and other aspects of Enlightenment political philosophy began to
					influence leaders in many parts of the world when they came to draw up legal
					systems and to establish rights for their citizens &ndash; most notably in the
					fledgling United States, whose Constitution (1789) adopted Montesquieu’s
					idea of the separation of power into branches of government.</p><p class="calibre14">More generally, the movement promoted the pursuit of knowledge for its own
					sake and recognized that one person’s quest for understanding could
					benefit the entire human race.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-751"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jean-Jacques Rousseau <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The Social Contract</i> (1762)</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-752"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">VOLTAIRE<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-753"><img alt="" src="images/000177.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">François-Marie Arouet, who chose to be known publicly by the name

					spoke several languages. He was a hugely prolific writer, producing works in
					almost every literary genre: novels, plays, poems, essays, historical studies,
					and philosophical books as well as countless pamphlets.</p><p class="calibre11">Voltaire was an outspoken supporter of social reform, including the defence of
					civil liberties and freedom of religion and speech; he also denounced the

				of the River Neva, on 27 May 1703. This new city, fortress, and port by the Baltic
				gave Russia direct sea access to Europe, opening new opportunities for both trade
				and military conquest. In 1712, Peter made his new city Russia’s capital,
				stripping the title from the ancient seat of Moscow.</p><p class="calibre14">An admirer of Western palaces, Peter employed European architects to design the
				government buildings, palaces, university, and houses in the fashionable baroque
				style. He also pressed 30,000 peasants each year into construction gangs, along with
				Russian convict labourers and Swedish prisoners of war. The regimen was strict, and
				living conditions stark: more than 100,000 workers died, but those who survived
				could earn their freedom.</p><p class="calibre14">The lavish design and vast scale of Peter’s architecture showed not only
				his appreciation of European culture, but also his determination to be an exalted,
				absolute ruler in the manner of Western despots such as Louis XIV. Peter used his
				power to make significant changes in Russia. He founded the Russian navy and
				reformed the army, which until then had relied on bands of men led by untrained
				village elders. He reorganised the army along European lines and developed new iron
				and munitions industries to equip it. By 1725, Russia had a professional army of
				130,000 men.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-756"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000106.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">St Petersburg</span> offered a new vision for the

					instead of traditional robes, and ordering them to cut off their long beards. He
					founded colleges, forced the nobility to educate their children, and promoted
					people to high rank according to their merit rather than their birth, as had
					previously been the case.</p><p class="calibre14">The emperor was also known for his harsh treatment of rebels, his aggressive
					foreign policy, and particularly for his successful war against Sweden, which
					gave him control of the Baltic Sea. This style of rule was continued under later
					monarchs, notably Catherine II, also “the Great”, who extended the
					modernizing trend Peter had begun. Influenced by the ideas of the European
					Enlightenment, she promoted education and the arts, sponsored translations of
					foreign literary works, and wrote books herself. She too increased
					Russia’s imperial strength, gaining military victories over the Ottoman
					Empire.</p><p class="calibre14">The rulers were also influenced by the example of Prussia, a north-German
					state that expanded in the 18th century due to an efficient bureaucracy, a
					powerful army, and strong leadership under kings such as Frederick II. Between
					Prussia and Russia lay Poland, whose territories these two powers and Austria

				“progress”. Change accelerated and seemed to have a clear direction.
				The world population exceeded 1 billion in 1804 and was approaching 2 billion by
				1914. This growth was made possible by tremendous increases in economic output.
				Agriculture became more efficient and large areas of new land were put to productive
				use. The exploitation of new sources of energy &ndash; especially steam power
				&ndash; the application of new technology, and organized industrial production in
				factories revolutionized the manufacture of commodities. Railways made it possible
				for humans to travel faster than a horse for the first time and cities expanded
				&ndash; for instance, the population in London increased from 1 million in 1800 to
				7 million in 1910. Improvements in public health and medicine increased life
				expectancy in the most advanced countries.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-773"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000014.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-774" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Human rights and equality</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Despite these advancements, it is debatable whether progress was detectable in
					the quality of life. At the start of this period, political revolutions in
					America and France enunciated principles of human rights and equal citizenship
					that radically challenged the existing order of society. By the early 20th
					century, liberals and democrats in Europe and North America could look with some
					complacency upon successes such as the widespread expansion of voting rights,
					the abolition of slavery, and freedom of speech. However, women remained mostly
					excluded from voting, and there was no economic equality. Extremes of wealth and
					poverty polarized the world’s wealthiest and most advanced societies, and
					conditions of life for industrial workers were often very miserable. Artists and
					intellectuals of the Romantic movement criticized the impact of mechanized
					industry on people and the environment, while socialist movements looked forward
					to further revolutions that would end the exploitation of man by man and create
					egalitarian societies.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-775" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Western imperialism</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The most obvious losers in the new world order created by industrial
					capitalism were the inhabitants of countries at the periphery of the global
					economy. The industrializing countries of the West, needing places to invest
					their excess capital, raw materials for their factories, and markets for their
					new products, found them in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They also sought
					land for their expanding populations to settle in thinly populated zones such as
					the North American plains and Australia. Peoples who stood in their way were
					swept aside. The Europeans started expanding the areas under their direct rule
					or control. The British takeover of the Indian subcontinent, more or less
					complete by the mid-19th century, was the most spectacular example of
					imperialism in action, and Sub-Saharan Africa was divided among the European
					powers as if the local population did not exist.</p><p class="calibre14">The world’s response to Western imperialism was mixed. Resistance was
					widespread in the form of wars and uprisings against European dominance. On the
					other hand, the growing superiority of the West in technology, science, military
					power, and social organization led several non-European governments to try to
					modernize based on the Western model. In the Muslim world, Egypt, Turkey, and
					Iran attempted, with only partial success, to pursue a modernizing agenda. In
					East Asia, Japan successfully transformed itself into an efficient modern state,
					becoming an imperialist power in its own right. China, by contrast, experienced
					turmoil and invasion, and imperial rule collapsed in the early 20th
					century.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-776" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Rising nationalism</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Most Europeans and people of European descent gloried in a sense of their own
					racial and cultural superiority to the rest of the world, but Europe remained a
					deeply divided continent. Militant nationalism, unleashed by the French
					Revolution, was a threat to stability. By 1815, the Napoleonic Wars had
					generated battles of unprecedented scale. After the wars of the mid-19th century
					that created a unified Italy and Germany, the great powers maintained large
					conscript armies and formed mutually hostile alliance systems. These armies were
					equipped with high-explosive shells and rapid-fire weapons.</p><p class="calibre14">European military power, which was supported by highly organized state systems
					and economies, was certainly one of the key elements in European world
					domination. There would be disaster when European states turned this power
					against one another.</p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the Second Continental
				Congress on 4 July 1776 and signed by all 56 delegates present. What would become
				the United States consisted of 13 British colonies, steadily established since the
				17th century, and scattered along the east coast of North America. They were not
				just geographically remote from their mother country; most were also geographically
				remote from each other. Their economies were fragile, and they had no coherent
				political identity &ndash; citizens of Virginia considered themselves to be
				Virginians, for example, not Americans &ndash; beyond an increasingly strained
				loyalty to the British crown.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the colonies were also remarkably self-aware and acutely conscious of
				Enlightenment notions of political liberty, and they were concerned that their
				freedom would come under threat as a result of British rule. Unable to assert their
				own natural rights, and subjected to what they considered unreasonably imposed
				taxes, the colonists questioned why a distant parliament and a distant king should
				impose their will on them. Impelled by a series of exceptional leaders, in 1776 they
				not only rejected British authority, but they set about establishing an entirely new
				kind of state in which government would derive from “the consent of the
				governed”. This explosively novel idea would lead to the creation of a new
				and enduring republican government.</p><p class="calibre14">Support for a formal assertion of American independence was far from universal in
				the colonies, however. Five states in particular &ndash; New York, New Jersey,
				Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania &ndash; feared it would damage trade and, if
				unsuccessful, provoke harsh reprisals from Britain. In the same way, as many as
				500,000 of a population of 2.5 million remained loyal to the British crown to the
				end of the conflict, many subsequently settling in Canada.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-779"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000111.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-780" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The conflict takes shape</h2></div><p class="calibre15">It would take a drawn-out and bitterly fought war to make independence into
					reality. Britain was determined to assert what it saw as its legitimate rule,
					while the hastily assembled forces of the nascent United States were no less
					determined to assert what they saw as their right to independence. The two
					modest armies &ndash; Britain’s, because of the difficulties of sending
					forces en masse to America; the colonists’, because they consistently
					lacked the means to raise and equip any substantial fighting force &ndash;
					confronted each other in a series of minor engagements over six years.</p><p class="calibre14">At their peak, the American forces numbered scarcely 40,000 and had almost no
					navy at all. Britain deployed about the same number of soldiers but in addition
					had a vastly greater number of ships. In 1778, however, France, declared support
					for the colonists and sent 5,000 troops and a substantial fleet. Facing certain
					defeat, in October 1781, the British surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia. The war
					would not formally end for another year, but in every important respect, the
					colonists &ndash; and their French allies &ndash; had dealt a huge blow to
					their British masters.</p><p class="calibre14">The French involvement in the creation of this new nation owed everything to a
					desire to reverse the humiliations of the Seven Years’ War. But the debts
					incurred would, ironically, be among the many causes of the bankruptcy of the
					French crown that led to the French Revolution in 1789. There was a profound
					irony, too, in absolutist France seeking to win Americans the freedoms that it
					was unwilling to accord its own citizens.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-781"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"These United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent

					encapsulated by the Declaration of Independence. It was the work of a distinctly
					patrician Virginian, a haughty, wealthy slave-owner named Thomas Jefferson. He
					was one of a committee of five charged with writing the Declaration, yet the two
					drafts it went through in June 1776 were almost entirely his own. It is hard to
					overstate the importance of the Declaration of Independence. It made, for the
					time, an astonishing claim: “that all men are created equal”. It
					further claimed “that governments are instituted among men deriving their
					just powers from the consent of the governed”.</p><p class="calibre14">These were actively seditious sentiments that neither George III of England
					nor Louis XVI of France could have any sympathy with. They nonetheless formed
					the bedrock of what would become the United States and, indeed, liberal
					political systems across the Western world. These political creeds, derived from
					the work of British and French Enlightenment thinkers, led to the creation of
					the first modern state and, in doing so, changed the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-783"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000340.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In <i class="calibre19">Declaration of

					France, where he was the United States’ first ambassador, delighting in
					its civilized elegance. He claimed to despise high office yet served two terms
					as President of the United States. And, as president, in 1803 he drove through
					the Louisiana Purchase, which saw a vast area west of the Mississippi
					transferred at a bargain price from France, its nominal ruler, to the United
					States. He understood that the destiny of the USA lay in its colonization of the
					vast lands to the west, he assented to the notion that its indigenous
					inhabitants should be driven off, and he owned slaves. “Blacks”,
					he asserted, “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body
					and mind.” Whereas George Washington, also a patrician Virginian, freed
					his slaves, Jefferson opted not to.</p><p class="calibre14">None of this, though, can diminish Jefferson’s significance in
					articulating notions of liberty that resonate today. And even though he felt
					slavery was wrong, his personal belief was that emancipation would be bad for
					both slaves and white Americans &ndash; unless they were returned to
					Africa.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-785"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"The god who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Thomas Jefferson</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-786" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A new constitution</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Although Jefferson can readily be considered the guiding spirit behind the
					Declaration of Independence, he played no formal role in the drawing up of the
					next great document that shaped the nation: its Constitution. The United States
					was legally able to assert its independence from Britain in 1783. But for the
					next four years, it existed in an increasingly unstable political vacuum, its
					fate decided by an ever-more divided Confederation Congress, meeting variously
					in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey.</p><p class="calibre14">There were serious reasons to believe the new nation might fail, torn apart by
					those arguing for the primacy of the rights of the individual states over the
					central government, and those in favour of a strong central government or even
					the creation of an American monarchy. In the spring of 1787, a Constitutional
					Convention took place in Philadelphia. The written, formalized Constitution
					proposed would not be provisionally ratified until June the following year, and
					then only after prolonged disputes. The result was an assertion of a new form of
					government. It was both a bill of rights and a blueprint for an ideal
					government, whose three branches &ndash; executive, legislative, and judiciary
					&ndash; would keep each other in check. It would have a profound influence on
					that issued in Revolutionary France in 1791 and remains a model of its
					kind.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-787" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">“Unfinished business”</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The founding fathers were rightly optimistic about the United States’
					potential, but they had failed to resolve one crucial question.
					Jefferson’s first draft of the Declaration of Independence called slavery
					“an execrable commerce” and “a cruel war against human
					nature itself”. However, to placate the slave states of the south and the
					slave traders of the north, these radical statements were later dropped. Almost
					90 years later, it would take a civil war and 620,000 dead to end the practice
					and complete what Abraham Lincoln saw as the “unfinished business”
					of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-788"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">GEORGE WASHINGTON<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-789"><img alt="" src="images/000316.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Born in 1732, George Washington served the British crown with distinction
					during the Seven Years’ War (1754&ndash;61) against France. He
					represented Virginia in the House of Burgesses and in the Continental Congresses

					unanimous choice to lead the Continental Army, which he did with imagination and
					great fortitude, especially in the very difficult early years of the conflict:
					his “skeleton of an army”, under-equipped and close to starving,
					was forced to endure an exceptionally harsh winter in 1777&ndash;78 at Valley
					Forge in Pennsylvania. From 1783, Washington sought to establish a
					constitutional government for the new nation. The nation’s first

				their city from a rumoured royal attack, stormed the crumbling fortress known as the
				Bastille and murdered its governor and guards. This violent defiance of royal power
				has become the symbol of the French Revolution, a movement that not only engulfed
				France but also reverberated around the world. The ideas articulated in the
				revolution spelled the beginning of the end for Europe’s absolute monarchies
				and inspired their eventual replacement by more democratic governments.</p><p class="calibre14">The French Revolution originally set out to sweep away aristocratic privilege and
				establish a new state based on the Enlightenment principles of <i class="calibre5">liberté</i>, <i class="calibre5">égalité</i>, and <i class="calibre5">fraternité</i>. But although it was introduced by a surge of
				optimism, the revolution soon degenerated into a violence that played out over
				several years and that would be brought to an end only by the dictatorship of
				Napoleon Bonaparte. It remains a story of confusion and chaos, of a collision
				between a privileged old order, the <i class="calibre5">ancien

				create a coherent new order.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-792"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"The French Revolution was the greatest step forward in the history of mankind

					confront any crisis, let alone one as grave as that facing France in 1789. In
					the previous century, his great-great-great-grandfather Louis XIV, the Sun King,
					had established France as an absolute monarchy, with all power concentrated in
					the king’s hands, and his palace at Versailles as the most sophisticated
					court in Europe and a bastion of aristocratic privilege.</p><p class="calibre14">Louis XVI thus ruled over a country where nobles refused to surrender any
					privileges, and taxes were paid almost exclusively by an oppressed peasantry:
					France was effectively bankrupt. In the late 18th century, France’s
					population was expanding rapidly, but unlike England, France had not had an
					agricultural revolution and remained particularly vulnerable to any failure of
					the harvest, as happened in 1787 and, again, in 1788. These desperate summers
					were followed in 1788&ndash;89 by a bitterly harsh winter, leading to mass
					starvation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-794"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000263.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-795" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The king’s response</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The financial crisis critical, Louis was desperate to raise further funds
					while preserving his authority, so he summoned what was called the States
					General, a semi-parliamentary body that had last assembled in 1614. It consisted
					of clergy, the first estate; nobles, the second; and the commons (essentially a
					kind of bourgeoisie, lawyers predominating), the third. The States General met
					at Versailles on 5 May 1789. Almost instantly, the nobles and clerics tried to
					assert that their votes should be worth more than those of the commons. In
					response, on 17 June, the commons declared itself a National Assembly, vesting
					power in itself instead of the crown. In August, with peasant uprisings across
					rural France, the Assembly abolished feudal taxes and aristocratic privileges
					and issued what it called the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a statement
					asserting fundamental freedoms.</p><p class="calibre14">In October 1789, events were suddenly accelerated when a vast crowd, outraged
					by the lack of bread in Paris, descended on Versailles and forcibly removed the
					royal family to Paris, ransacking the palace for good measure. In what would
					become an unnerving foretaste of the violence to come, the severed heads of the
					guards at Versailles were paraded on stakes as Louis and his family were
					escorted to the capital.</p><p class="calibre14">It had been comparatively easy to overthrow the existing royal government, but
					it would prove infinitely harder to establish a new government. It was presumed
					that a kind of constitutional monarchy would be the most obvious solution. In
					the event, France found itself wrenched between those arguing for this more or
					less moderate option, and those in favour of a much more radical republican
					alternative.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-796"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000237.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The storming</span> of the Bastille symbolized

					doomed, the king had not entirely abandoned hope of reasserting his authority.
					Large numbers of French aristocrats &ndash; emigrés &ndash; had already
					fled France, fearing the revolution had made it unsafe. In trying to persuade
					other European regimes &ndash; Austria above all, whose emperor was the brother
					of the French queen Marie-Antoinette &ndash; they stirred up opposition to the
					revolution, but their principal impact was to reinforce a determination in
					France to see the revolution succeed.</p><p class="calibre14">In June 1791, Louis attempted to escape, but was intercepted near the border
					with the Low Countries and brought back to Paris to the jeers of the
					increasingly violent, politicized common folk, the sans-culottes, their name a
					reference to their striped, baggy trousers. There was an increasingly hostile
					stand-off between political factions in Paris, such as the Girondins and more
					extremist Jacobins, which attracted the support of the sans-culottes, and the
					French government.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-798"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe, and inflexible justice; it is

					being made. In September 1791, a constitutional monarchy was proclaimed.
					Similarly, the church’s privileged position was forcibly ended, though
					this, too, provoked lasting upheaval and violence. Equally critically, the
					freedom of the press was asserted.</p><p class="calibre14">At the same time, revolutionary France faced an external threat from Austria
					and Prussia, both determined to reassert the primacy of hereditary monarchy and
					to forestall revolutionary tendencies in their own countries. In April 1792,
					France declared war on both, a war that would continue, in different guises, for
					23 years. By August, the combined Austrian and Prussian forces were within 160km
					(100 miles) of Paris.</p><p class="calibre14">A kind of hysteria gripped the city. A mob stormed the Tuileries, where the
					royal family was held, slaughtering its Swiss Guards. The following month, a
					further round of killings, the September Massacres, was unleashed against anyone
					suspected of royalist sympathies. September 1792 also marked the establishment
					of the directly elected National Convention and of the First French Republic.
					Almost its first act was to put Louis XVI on trial as a traitor. In January
					1793, he was executed, an early victim of the guillotine, championed as a humane
					and egalitarian means of death.</p><p class="calibre14">The sense of crisis continued to grow. In April 1793, the Committee of Public
					Safety was created to safe-guard the revolution. For a year or more, under the
					chairmanship of a provincial lawyer, Maximilien Robespierre, the most
					influential of the now-dominant Jacobins, it would effectively become the
					government of France. Its impact on France, however short-lived, was
					devastating. This was the Terror. Counter-revolutionary movements across the
					country were ruthlessly suppressed, most obviously in the Vendée region
					of the southwest, where up to 300,000 died. Churches proved particularly rich
					targets. The Terror’s victims were less likely to be remaining
					aristocrats and more anyone Robespierre suspected of impure thoughts, including
					almost all of his political opponents.</p><p class="calibre14">Robespierre’s single-minded pursuit of revolutionary purity reached an
					improbable climax with his creation in 1794 of a new religion, the Cult of the
					Supreme Being. It was intended as a focus of, and spur to, patriotic and
					revolutionary virtues, the superstition of the Catholic Church replaced by a
					belief dedicated to reason celebrating the natural laws of the universe. The
					megalomania it suggested contributed significantly to his sudden downfall, and
					at the end of July 1794, Robespierre was put to the guillotine.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-800"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"So, legislators, place Terror on the order of the day! … The blade

					of yet another government, the Directory, at the end of 1795 &ndash; order of a
					sort was restored. Tellingly, it was achieved in part by the Directory’s
					willingness to use force against the Paris mob, ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte,
					then a young general in the revolutionary army.</p><p class="calibre14">Furthermore, France’s armies, boosted by mass conscription, were
					reversing early defeats, apparently poised to carry the revolution into new
					territories. Emboldened, France reinforced its assertion of what it claimed were
					its “natural frontiers” on the Rhine, which in reality meant an
					audacious extension of French rule into Germany. By 1797, it had inflicted
					crushing defeats over Austria in the Low Countries and in northern Italy. France
					was ready to re-assert what it saw as its natural primacy in Europe.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-803"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000158.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The French Revolution</span> set out with the

					ending of repressive monarchy and entrenched privilege; the establishment of
					representative government; and the championing of universal rights. But the
					reality was confused and often violent.</p><p class="calibre14">Furthermore, by 1804 Napoleon had effectively swapped one form of absolutism
					for his own, albeit one vastly more effective than any France had known since
					Louis XIV. Yet the revolution’s consequences reverberated well into the
					20th century. It remains a pivotal moment in the belief that freedom should
					underpin the civilized world.</p></div><div class="section_feature6" id="calibre_link-805"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-806"><img alt="" src="images/000183.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Robespierre (1758&ndash;94), a lawyer and a member of the third estate in
					1789, was the chief architect of the Terror that gripped France between
					September 1793 and July 1794. He was a consistent champion of the dispossessed,
					as well as a remarkable orator, capable of astonishingly intense speeches that
					electrified his supporters and opponents alike. He was also a fierce opponent of
					the Revolutionary Wars, believing that a strengthened army risked becoming a
					source of counter-revolutionary fervour. Initially, at least, he was also
					opposed to the death penalty. His change of mind was startlingly absolute. When
					persuaded that terror was the most effective means of preserving the revolution,
					he embraced it implacably, arguing that it was the natural handmaiden of the
					virtue he felt should drive the revolution. He remains the original, chilling
					model for all those who have since championed state violence in the interests of
					a supposed greater good.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-94" class="calibre3">Louis XIV begins personal rule of

				ground, in which 118,000 British, Dutch, and Prussian forces finally prevailed over
				a French army of 73,000, hastily assembled by Napoleon.</p><p class="calibre14">France’s Revolutionary Wars, which began in 1792, had been launched to
				extend Revolutionary principles to neighbouring states and to defend France against
				its enemies. Under Napoleon, they became, in effect, wars of conquest, despite being
				waged in the name of the Revolution.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-809"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000110.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-810" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A continent reshaped</h2></div><p class="calibre15">During the Revolutionary Wars, France had established sister republics in
					northern Italy and the Low Countries; under Napoleon, many of these were
					reformed into kingdoms, whose monarchs came from the Emperor’s family.
					States across Germany were carved up, at the expense of Prussia, to become a
					French puppet state, while the 800-year-old Holy Roman Empire was abolished.
					From 1807, much of Poland was controlled by the French as the Grand Duchy of
					Warsaw. These were states recast on French lines: clerical power was reduced,
					serfdom abolished, and aristocratic privilege ended. But such reforms provoked
					inevitable resentments.</p><p class="calibre14">Napoleon’s conquests were the result not just of military genius but
					also of greatly enlarged French armies. Conscription, introduced in 1793,
					swelled the French army from 160,000 men to 1.5 million.</p><p class="calibre14">Only Britain, protected by the English Channel, remained undefeated, its
					position as the world’s leading maritime power underscored by victory at
					Trafalgar, off southern Spain, in 1805. But maritime muscle alone was not enough
					to beat Napoleon. Britain’s most significant role was financing the
					endlessly shifting alliances confronting the French.</p><p class="calibre14">In response, Napoleon imposed the Continental System, which forbade trade
					between continental Europe and Britain. However, Portugal and Russia continued
					to trade with Britain, prompting Napoleonic invasions in 1807 and 1812
					respectively.</p><p class="calibre14">Resistance to Napoleonic rule was mounting; the Spanish began a brutal
					guerrilla war that drained French resources and came to be referred to by
					Napoleon as the “Spanish ulcer”.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-811" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The final defeat</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Napoleon had bred a sense of French invincibility, and this made his eventual
					defeat all the more traumatic for the nation. Of the 450,000 men he led against
					Russia in 1812, barely 40,000 survived.</p><p class="calibre14">Napoleon had overreached himself. At Leipzig, Germany, in 1813, outnumbered
					three to one by forces from Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden, he suffered
					his first major defeat. By Waterloo, his forces had recovered slightly, and the
					ratio was only two to one, but Napoleon’s military genius failed to
					redress the balance and his imperial ambition ended in the Waterloo mud.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-812"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"All Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the

					His most enduring reform was the introduction, in 1804, of the Napoleonic Code,
					which is still the basis of French law. Forced to resign in 1814, Napoleon was
					exiled to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean, from where he escaped before

				relatively easy and also largely bloodless. Elsewhere, it was complex, long drawn
				out, and violent. It was a reflection of societies comprising a teeming range of

					revolutions, the drive to independence in South America was seldom the product
					of a desire for social justice or representative government. Aside from two
					abortive Mexican revolutions in 1810 and 1813, it was a struggle for supremacy
					between ruling elites, none of which had much interest in the kind of social
					change &ndash; society recast on liberal principles &ndash; that underpinned
					the French Revolution. That said, this drive was also significantly affected by
					the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s invasion of Portugal in 1807 forced the
					Portuguese king, João VI, and his court to flee to safety in its
					Brazilian colony. João remained there even after the fall of Napoleon in
					1815, returning to Portugal only in 1821. However, his son and heir, Pedro,
					stayed in Brazil.</p><p class="calibre14">As in Spain’s Latin American colonies, Brazil was dominated by a
					land-owning elite, a great many of whom, over many generations, had been born in
					South America. They came to resent the fact that ultimate authority was
					exercised by a distant monarchy, and saw no reason why they should submit to
					it.</p><p class="calibre14">There are clear parallels with the American Revolution. But while in North
					America it was the fundamental liberties of free-born men that were disputed, in
					Brazil the issue was narrower &ndash; it was simply a question of who would
					govern.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1822, to protect the interests of the native-born elite, Pedro declared
					Brazil an independent constitutional monarchy and himself its emperor. This was
					a revolution only in the sense that it produced Brazilian independence in the
					interests of those already ruling it. One of the more obvious consequences was
					that, with no change to the social or economic order, slavery remained legal in
					Brazil until 1888, later than anywhere else in the Western world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-819"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000063.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Pedro I of Brazil</span>, whose coronation is

					desire of the native-born ruling class &ndash; the creoles &ndash; to assert
					their interests, not least in the face of Spain’s restrictive control of
					South American trade and punitive taxation policies, both to the disadvantage of
					the colonies. In the short term, however, it was a reaction to Napoleon’s
					invasion of Spain in 1808 and his deposition of the Spanish king, Ferdinand VII,
					in favour of Napoleon’s brother, Joseph. In effect, Spain’s
					colonies no longer had a legitimate ruler of their own, so it was their plain
					duty to become rulers themselves, at least until the monarchy could be
					restored.</p><p class="calibre14">While South American liberals saw Joseph as the harbinger of a new, more just
					social order in place of the absolutism of Ferdinand VII, monarchists in the
					colonies saw any such liberalizing tendencies as inherently destabilizing. The
					seeds of internal conflict were being sown.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-821" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Social revolution in Mexico</h2></div><p class="calibre15">At the time, Mexico, which was known as the Vice-Royalty of New Spain,
					encompassed an immense area that extended almost from present-day Wyoming to
					Panama and that included most of Texas. Events there took a different turn. In
					1810, a priest, Miguel Hidalgo, appalled at the obvious inequalities of Mexico,
					led a popular revolution that ended the following year in its brutal suppression
					and Hidalgo’s execution. A further popular uprising led by a second
					Catholic priest, José Morelos, between 1813 and 1815 was similarly put
					down. When, in 1821, Mexico did gain independence, it was by force against more
					or less token Spanish resistance, and under the leadership of Augustín de
					Iturbide, a Mexican general who proclaimed himself emperor of Mexico the
					following year. His rule lasted less than a year. By 1838, Mexico had lost all
					its Central American territories, and by 1848, it had lost all its North
					American territories.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-822"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"For my blood, my honour, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Prince Pedro <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">Future Emperor Pedro I of Brazil

					Vice-Royalties of New Granada, Peru, and Rio de la Plata &ndash; followed a
					very different course. The key figure here was Simón Bolívar. Born
					in modern-day Venezuela, he was a creole, aristocratic, and highly educated. He
					had visited Europe several times and was an enthusiastic supporter of modern
					nation-building on the model established by the French Revolution. He believed,
					in particular, that the diverse peoples and interests of South America could be
					brought together by the assertion of a shared South American identity, expressed
					by the creation of a vast new South American state. This was to be Gran
					Colombia, which embraced an immense area of northern South America, essentially
					the modern states of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.</p><p class="calibre14">Bolívar’s vision of an independent South America consistently
					fell foul of a series of political realities. His military successes &ndash;
					for example, in 1824, the routing of the remaining Spanish strongholds in Peru,
					when his armies attacked from the north and the south in a pincer movement in
					the Central Andes &ndash; proved impossible to translate into enduring and
					stable states.</p><p class="calibre14">Bolívar was an idealist and a passionate opponent of slavery. He
					considered that so disparate a land and a people could only be ruled by a strong
					central government. Seeing himself as its natural leader, he proposed himself as
					the lifelong president of Gran Colombia. This provoked predictably bitter
					opposition.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-824"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"May slavery be banished forever together with the distinction between

					&ndash; Gran Colombia had already broken up. Arguably, it was the result of the
					kind of nationalism already surfacing in Europe, with the independence of Greece
					and, the following year, of Belgium. More particularly, it was due to a failure
					to agree on the future of Gran Colombia. There were disputes over whether its
					government was to be liberal, conservative, or authoritarian. Venezuela, in
					particular, was subjected to bitter wars throughout the 19th century that cost
					the lives of an estimated 1 million people.</p><p class="calibre14">This lack of direction resulted in instability and a social inequality that
					would persist for a century or more. It would also produce a series of
					authoritarian military leaders acting in the interests of the landowners. An
					inevitable consequence was a persistently oppressed underclass, urban and
					agricultural, black and white. The <i class="calibre5">hacienda</i>
					&ndash; vast acres inefficiently worked by armies of peasants in the interests
					of a complacently cruel, land-owning elite &ndash; dominated.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1910, Mexico descended into a further revolution. This was partly a result
					of being wrenched between ineffectual liberal regimes that sought to alleviate
					the obvious suffering of the poor but did little to address fundamental economic
					weaknesses and self-serving authoritarian regimes that cared more for bombast
					than real reform.</p><p class="calibre14">Bolívar’s visions of a recast, independent South America could
					never contend with the reality of an unequal society that shared no common
					belief in its own destiny and that was consistently the victim of competing,
					mostly violent efforts to assert special interests.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-826"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000044.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Battle of Ayacucho</span> (1824) saw the

				locomotives, also designed by Stephenson, that were capable of reaching speeds
				approaching 48km/h (30mph).</p><p class="calibre14">Stephenson’s <i class="calibre5">Rocket</i> symbolized what
				remains the key development in world history over the past 250 years: the
				transformation from an agricultural society that relied on windmills, watermills,
				horses, and other beasts of burden, to an industrial one, in which steam engines
				were capable of generating reliable power on a scale that was previously
				unimaginable.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-831"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000397.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-832" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The background</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The industrialization process that started in Britain around the mid- to late
					18th century was initiated by the scientific revolution in Europe in the late
					17th century. Of similar importance were financial changes pioneered in the
					Netherlands, then imported to Britain: more readily available credit helped
					boost entrepreneurial activities. It had never been easier for members of the
					increasingly wealthy middle class, looking for ways to invest their money, to
					support new inventions and technologies.</p><p class="calibre14">A third factor was an agricultural revolution, which began in the Netherlands
					and Britain, where farmers realized that crop rotation made it unnecessary to
					leave land fallow every third year. In both of these countries, land reclamation
					increased the acreage available for farming. Crop yields were thus boosted, just
					as selective breeding produced larger and more profitable domesticated animals
					&ndash; sources of food and wool alike. With any likelihood of famine now
					receding, the population of Britain grew, between 1750 and 1800, from 6.5
					million to over 9 million. This, in turn, meant new markets and an expanded
					workforce.</p><p class="calibre14">Finally, in Britain, an improved transport network allowed goods, produced on
					an ever-larger scale, to be transported faster and more reliably. Between 1760
					and 1800, as many as 6,840km (4,250 miles) of canals were built in
					England.</p><p class="calibre14">Thinkers sought to understand the impulses behind these societal changes. The
					publication in 1776 of <i class="calibre5">The Wealth of Nations</i>
					by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith underpinned what was becoming known as
					political economy, and the central role of the profit motive and of competition
					in increasing efficiencies and lowering prices.</p><p class="calibre14">This economic transformation also contributed to and was, in turn, boosted by
					the emergence of global markets &ndash; a consequence of burgeoning European
					colonial empires, which offered greater access to raw materials and also
					provided markets for finished goods. A better-mapped world, and improvements in
					ship types and position-finding at sea, also facilitated global trade.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-833"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"A hundred years ago business was limited in area, now it is

					development of the steam engine. In an astonishingly short time, it would
					revolutionize Britain, making it the world’s first industrial power, and
					ultimately transform the world. Even so, it might never have had its dramatic
					global impact had Britain not had huge reserves of the fuel needed to make it
					work: coal. The replacement of wood as the prime source of fuel was critical to
					industrial development. In exactly the same way, the development of coke
					(processed coal that burns at much higher temperatures than coal) at the
					beginning of the 18th century would make the production of iron &ndash; the
					indispensable core material of the new technologies &ndash; faster and
					simpler.</p><p class="calibre14">Steam engines of varying degrees of reliability had been in existence since
					1712, when Thomas Newcomen built an “atmospheric engine”. But it
					was only with James Watts’s first rotating steam engine in 1781 that the
					extraordinary potential of machine power became clear. The earliest steam
					engines had been used mainly as pumps. Watts’s rotating engine, on the
					other hand, could power machinery. The engineering company he and Matthew
					Boulton established in Birmingham in 1775 produced over 500 steam
					engines.</p><p class="calibre14">When Watts’s patents expired, in 1800, others started producing their
					own steam engines. The textile industries in the northwest benefited in
					particular from the increased availability of steam power, and large-scale,
					almost entirely mechanized, factory production soon replaced small, home-based
					manufacturing. By 1835, there were more than 120,000 power looms in textile
					mills. No longer dependent on rivers as power sources, factories could be built
					anywhere, and they came to be concentrated in towns in the north and Midlands of
					England that rapidly grew into major industrial centres as the century
					progressed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-835"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000371.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Stephenson’s <i class="calibre19">Rocket</i></span> was the steam engine on the world’s first passenger

					synonymous with poor living and working conditions for the workforce, many of
					whom were children. This influx led to the creation of an urban underclass. It
					took a long time before the workers saw any improvement in their lives, and the
					realization that they should share in the rewards of this social and economic
					transformation, rather than simply be exploited as mere drudges, came very
					slowly. In the meantime, however, the increasingly wealthy factory owners
					emerged as a significant political voice.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-837" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The wider world</h2></div><p class="calibre15">As late as 1860, Britain was, by some way, still the world’s leading
					industrial and mercantile power, but other Western nations were quick to see how
					they too could benefit. In continental Europe, industrialization was initially
					uncertain, inhibited by the kind of political instability Britain had managed to
					avoid, such as the revolutions of 1848. Later, the pace of its development would
					rival Britain’s. In 1840, Germany and France each had around 480km (300
					miles) of railway lines; in 1870, both had 16,000km (10,000 miles). Similarly,
					pig-iron output from each rose from about 125,000 tons in 1840 to 1 million in
					1870.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the most startling developments came in the United States, where
					there were around 5,300km (3,300 miles) of railway in 1840, almost all in the
					northeast. By 1860, this had increased to 51,500km (32,000 miles), and by 1900
					it had soared to 310,600km (193,000 miles) of rail track. The production of pig
					iron rose similarly: in 1810, it was a little less than 100,000 tons a year; in
					1850, it was approaching 700,000 tons; in 1900, it was over 13 million.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-838"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000347.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Bessemer process</span>, devised by the
							English engineer of the same name to convert iron into steel, improved
							the efficiency of all industries &ndash; from transport to the
							military.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-839" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The role of steel</h2></div><p class="calibre15">By about 1870, in both Europe and the United States, a second wave of
					industrialization began, in which oil, chemicals, electricity, and steel became
					increasingly important. The production of steel had been transformed after 1855,
					when English engineer Henry Bessemer devised a way to make the metal lighter,
					stronger, and more versatile; from that point forwards, steel would prove the
					linchpin for industry. In 1870, total world steel production was 540,000 tons,
					but within 25 years it had risen to 14 million tons, and railways, armament
					production, and the shipbuilding industry all benefited from its ready
					availability.</p><p class="calibre14">While Germany was beginning to threaten Britain’s industrial preeminent
					position in Europe, quadrupling its industrial output between 1870 and 1914, the
					United States was rapidly becoming the world’s largest industrial power.
					In 1880, Britain was still producing more steel than the United States, but by
					1900 the United States was producing more steel than Britain and Germany
					together.</p><p class="calibre14">At the same time, steam-powered ships were also being introduced. Sailing
					times, no longer dependent on the vagaries of the wind, became more
					controllable, and journey times were shortened. The ships were significantly
					larger, too. While the largest wooden ships rarely exceeded 60m (200ft) in
					length, the <i class="calibre5">Great Eastern</i>, launched in 1858,
					was 210m (689ft) long. Total world steamship tonnage in 1870 was 1.4 million. By
					1910, it had reached 19 million.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-840" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Winners and losers</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The benefits of industrialization were unevenly spread. Southern Europe was
					slow to react to it, and Russia also struggled to catch up. The Chinese and
					Indian empires proved unwilling or unable to industrialize, Latin America did so
					only intermittently, and Africa was dominated by technologically superior
					powers. By contrast, after 1868, Japan’s single-minded pursuit of
					industrialization made it a world power.</p><p class="calibre14">Industrialization also made possible a new kind of warfare, one capable of
					bringing death on a scale never seen before. An enduring irony of
					industrialization is that the nations that benefited most from it turned it
					against themselves in two world wars, deploying weapons of extraordinarily
					destructive power.</p><p class="calibre14">The Industrial Revolution laid the foundations for the modern world. Fuelled
					by an enormous sense of new possibilities, in some places it raised living
					standards across all sections of society in ways unimaginable in earlier ages.
					However, in the wealthy West, it also produced a sense that material superiority
					was equivalent to a kind of moral superiority, one that not merely made it
					possible for the West to dominate the world, but demanded that it do so.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-841"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000327.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div class="section_feature7" id="calibre_link-842"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-843"><img alt="" src="images/000301.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">No figure better encapsulates the determination, ambition, and vision that
					drove the first phase of the Industrial Revolution in Britain than the
					prodigiously hard-working Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806&ndash;59). He was
					responsible for an extraordinary series of firsts: the world’s longest
					bridge (the Clifton Suspension Bridge), the world’s longest tunnel (Box
					Tunnel in Wiltshire), and the world’s largest ship (the <i class="calibre5">Great Eastern</i>). In 1827, still only 21, he was
					appointed chief engineer of the Thames Tunnel. In 1833, he became engineer to
					the newly formed Great Western Railway, which by 1841 linked London directly
					with Bristol, whose docks he had rebuilt from 1832. Believing it should be
					possible to travel directly from London to New York, Brunel also designed the
					world’s first practical ocean-going steamship, the <i class="calibre5">Great Western</i>. He followed this with the
					screw-driven iron-built <i class="calibre5">Great Britain</i>.
					Despite his great vision, delays and cost overruns dogged many of
					Brunel’s projects, but his works include some of the grandest feats of

				the United States and the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in Britain marked a
				radical shift in Western thinking. Even as late as the 1780s, the trade in slaves
				was still regarded as a “natural” economic activity. Both the newly
				created United States, “conceived in liberty”, and the European
				colonies in the Caribbean depended on slave labour that was relatively easily
				obtained in West Africa. Portuguese-ruled Brazil was even more dependent on slaves.
				Yet Britain in particular found itself in an uncomfortably anomalous position. Not
				only had slavery never been legal there &ndash; a point critically reinforced in
				1772 in what was called the Somersett case, which ruled that any slave was free once
				on British soil &ndash; but Britons prided themselves on their robust defence of
				such fundamental freedoms.</p><p class="calibre14">Even so, Britain was also, by some margin, the West’s leading slave-trading
				nation. It was this contradiction that offended both religious and Enlightenment
				political sensibilities alike.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-846"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000244.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-847" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Global changes</h2></div><p class="calibre15">To a number of high-minded and unusually active campaigners such as William
					Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the abolition of slavery became an imperative.
					A remarkably effective campaign was launched that, despite entrenched
					opposition, rapidly won wide public and parliamentary support. For much of the
					19th century, the Royal Navy would be at the forefront of the campaign to
					intercept those still engaged in slave trading.</p><p class="calibre14">While Britain took the lead, the movement had important supporters elsewhere.
					The revolutionary French National Convention outlawed slavery in 1794 (though
					this would partially be overturned by Napoleon in 1802). Brazil aside, where
					slavery would not be banned until 1888, all the newly independent states that
					emerged in Latin America after 1810 likewise outlawed slavery.</p><p class="calibre14">It wasn’t until 1833 that slavery itself, as opposed to the trade, was
					made illegal in the British Empire. Whatever the efforts of a new set of
					campaigners, not least Elizabeth Heyrick, the motive was not entirely
					humanitarian. The Haitian slave revolt, which began in 1791 and led to the
					emergence of an independent Haiti in 1804, had left the West uncomfortably aware
					that any such uprisings might prove difficult to suppress. A slave revolt in
					British-ruled Jamaica in 1831 reinforced the point: in the longer term, freeing
					slaves might prove less trouble than enslaving them.</p><p class="calibre14">The United States, forward-looking and expansive, remained the great troubling
					sore. The more abolitionists in its industrializing northern states denounced
					slavery, the more its southern states, their agrarian economies dependent on

					(1791&ndash;1804). This French Caribbean colony, known as St Domingue, owed its
					enormous prosperity to slave labour. The revolt, led by a freed slave, Toussaint
					L’Ouverture, was inspired by the American and French revolutions. Yet
					neither country supported it: the US was concerned it might inspire similar
					revolts in its slave states; France, despite its pledge to abolish slavery, was
					wary of the damage to its trade. Spain, which ruled the eastern half of the
					island, also opposed it, as did Britain, fearing it would spread to its own
					colonies. Even the South American colonies seeking independence refused to back
					it, fearful of its impact among their substantial slave populations. Yet the
					occasional combined resources of all these states were unable to quell the
					uprising. This was the only slave revolt to result in the emergence of an

				place, a Second Republic was declared. In June, fearful that one authoritarian
				government had been exchanged for another, the Parisian working classes rose again,
				but the uprising was savagely put down. In December, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte

				even more violent uprising 23 years later, in 1871.</p><p class="calibre14">The spark for the revolution of 1848 was a famine during the previous two winters.
				This provoked widespread unrest among the dispossessed urban poor, along with
				demands from a burgeoning bourgeoisie for liberal political reforms. The ardour of
				the revolution sparked similar revolts across continental Europe, most obviously in
				the German Confederation, in multi-ethnic Austria, and in Italy. Every single revolt

					create a political order that would stifle such an occurrence. Their goal was
					the preservation of aristocratic ruling elites, sustaining the old order and
					holding frontiers.</p><p class="calibre14">This desire, however, was to be countered by a new political reality informed
					by a number of factors, including the desire to ensure that the liberties
					championed by the French Revolution were upheld. This new reality was also the
					result of what came to be called nationalism: the right of peoples, however they
					were defined, to determine their own futures as independent nations. Just as
					important was the emergence of a new political creed &ndash; socialism &ndash;
					that sought to end the inequalities accelerated by the Industrial Revolution and
					led to impoverished workers being exploited by factory owners.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-855"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your

					Germany, which would exploit a kind of popular nationalism to unify their

				linking the Mediterranean and the Red seas, was an emphatic declaration of European
				&ndash; specifically, French &ndash; technological and financial means. It was
				also a significant illustration of a rapidly emerging and increasingly
				interdependent global economy, featuring goods from all parts of the world being
				traded on an ever-larger scale. This was a process dominated by Europe’s
				colonial powers and the United States, overwhelmingly its principal beneficiaries.
				It was simultaneously a further boost to Europe’s imperial ambitions.</p><p class="calibre14">The Suez Canal reduced the sailing route between London and Bombay by 41 per cent,
				and the route between London and Hong Kong by 26 per cent. The impact on trade was
				plain to see. However, reduced sailing times also greatly simplified the defence of
				India and its crucial markets, Britain’s key imperial goal. By the end of the
				19th century, trade in the Indian Ocean, protected by no fewer than 21 Royal Navy
				bases, had become almost a British monopoly, a point further underlined when Britain
				gained control of the Suez Canal in 1888 after having invaded and occupied Egypt six
				years earlier. This “gunboat diplomacy” proved a remarkably effective
				means of protecting British interests.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-861"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000094.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-862" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The Panama Canal</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The Suez Canal was just one of a number of similar massive engineering
					undertakings in the interests of imperial trade. An even more challenging
					project was the construction, begun in 1881, of the Panama Canal in Central
					America, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It too was a French
					initiative, but one dogged by controversy and a consistently hostile climate
					that cost the lives of 22,000 labourers. The United States eventually completed
					the Panama Canal in August 1914, stepping in when the French finally admitted
					defeat. It was the largest and most expensive engineering project in the world.
					It, too, dramatically reduced sailing times, shortening the Liverpool to San
					Francisco route by 42 per cent, and the New York to San Francisco route by 60
					per cent.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-863"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000144.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Suez Canal</span> opened in 1869 and

							advances.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-864" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">US involvement</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The fact that the United States took over the construction of the Panama Canal
					underlines a crucial shift in US attitudes: they were committing not just to
					expanding trade but also to advancing US overseas interests. This had begun in
					1898, when the US itself became a colonial power, taking over the Philippines
					from Spain.</p><p class="calibre14">The process began to accelerate under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt
					(1901&ndash;09). He actively advocated US military involvement, above all, in
					Latin America, to ensure stability as a means of advancing American interests.
					One consequence of this was his strengthening of the US Navy, the Great White
					Fleet.</p><p class="calibre14">Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft, pursued a more legalistic variant
					of the policy &ndash; Dollar Diplomacy &ndash; by which American commercial
					interests, chiefly in Latin America and the Far East, were to be secured by the
					full backing of the US government, and huge overseas investments
					encouraged.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-865"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to be a

					Europe. The east and west coasts of the US were first linked by rail in 1869,
					with the opening of the 3,070-km (1,907-mile) Central Pacific Railroad. By 1905,
					there were eight more transcontinental rail lines across the United States and
					one in Canada.</p><p class="calibre14">The building of the Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia, between 1891 and 1905,
					was undertaken in the same spirit. A remarkable 7,400km (4,600 miles) long and
					spanning seven time zones, it remains the longest continuous railway in the
					world. It played a key role not just in the settlement of Russia’s vast
					Siberian territories, but in Russia’s encroachment on parts of northern
					China, too.</p><p class="calibre14">The impact of the telegraph was just as significant, allowing messages to be
					communicated along electrical lines. Samuel Morse devised the system in the
					United States in the 1830s, and the first telegraph line was inaugurated in May
					1844. Within a decade, there were 32,200km (20,000 miles) of telegraph cable in
					the US.</p><p class="calibre14">The first telegraph cable across the Atlantic, laid in 1858, worked for only
					two weeks. But by 1866, a new cable had been installed, capable of transmitting
					120 words per minute. By 1870, a telegraph link had been established between
					London and Bombay; this was then extended to Australia in 1872 and New Zealand
					in 1876. By 1902, the United States was linked to Hawaii. This was the first
					near-instant international communications system.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-867"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000051.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The RMS <i class="calibre19">Mauretania</i></span>, built at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, UK, was the largest and

						<i class="calibre5">Great Eastern</i>, designed by the most
					visionary engineer of the first phase of the Industrial Revolution, Isambard
					Kingdom Brunel. Designed to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia
					non-stop (and to return to England without refuelling), the ship was overly
					ambitious in concept and a commercial failure.</p><p class="calibre14">However, it was indicative of a trend towards larger, faster, and safer ships.
					Unlike the <i class="calibre5">Great Eastern</i>, which was built of
					iron, later, steel-built, propeller-driven ships would prove more versatile.
					Their introduction coincided with the development of more powerful and efficient
					steam engines.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-869"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"The scheme in question is the cutting of a canal through the Isthmus of

One
					notable result was the introduction of a series of ever-larger passenger ships.
					The transatlantic route saw the most obvious developments. In 1874, the British
					steamer <i class="calibre5">Britannic</i>, capable of generating
					5,500 horsepower, set a new east&ndash;west Atlantic record of just under eight
					days. In 1909, the <i class="calibre5">Mauretania</i>, which
					generated 70,000 horsepower and carried over 2,000 passengers, set a new record
					of four days and 10 hours, cruising at an average speed of 26 knots, or 48km/h
					(30mph).</p><p class="calibre14">New types of merchant ships &ndash; mainly refrigerated vessels &ndash; were
					also being built. Such developments show how technology helped drive trade,
					making it possible to reach global markets. The cattle and sheep farms in South
					America (especially Argentina), Australia, and New Zealand were growing in size
					in line with their own populations. At the same time, the number of people in
					Europe was also increasing &ndash; for example, Britain swelled from 28 million
					to 35 million between 1850 and 1880. Feeding and clothing the populations were
					important priorities. Wool could be easily transported, but lamb and beef could
					not be shipped because it would rot en route &ndash; until 1877, when 80 tons
					of frozen beef were shipped from Argentina to France on board the world’s
					first refrigerated ship. By 1881, regular shipments of frozen meat were
					travelling between Australia and Britain. The first shipment of lamb from New
					Zealand was made the following year. There was a vast increase in the export of
					meat from all three countries &ndash; New Zealand, for example, exported 2.3
					million frozen sheep in 1895, 3.3 million in 1900, and 5.8 million in
					1910.</p><p class="calibre14">The demand for cotton &ndash; above all in the great textile mills of the
					northwest of England, which by 1850 were producing up to 50 per cent of the
					world’s cloth &ndash; led to an enormous surge in cotton growing. In the
					southern states of the US, raw cotton production increased from 100,000 bales in
					1800 to 4 million in 1860. During the American Civil War, the southern,
					Confederate states restricted exports of cotton in an attempt to force European
					intervention in the war. However, the ploy failed, since Britain merely
					increased its imports of raw cotton from India. After weaving the cotton, it
					then exported it back to India at substantial profits.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-871"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000026.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Suez Canal</span> greatly shortened travel

							miles.</p></div></div><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-872"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"Although gold and silver are not by nature money, money is by nature gold

					banking and financing. Throughout the late 19th century, new banks were
					established, their capital used to support enterprises across the world. At the
					same time, London emerged as the world’s financial capital. By the end of
					the 19th century, the British pound sterling, its value pegged at 113 grains of
					gold, was the currency against which all others were measured.</p><p class="calibre14">Western overseas investments dramatically increased. By 1914, the United
					States had overseas assets worth $3.5 billion, Germany $6 billion, France $8
					billion, and Britain almost $20 billion. Between them, North America and
					northern Europe’s share of world income in 1860 was about $4.3 billion a
					year, 35 per cent of the world’s total. In 1914, it was $18.5 billion, 60
					per cent of the world’s total.</p><p class="calibre14">Patterns of imperialism varied over the 19th century. In the British Empire,
					for example, clear and increasing distinctions were drawn between those colonies
					&ndash; in Africa and Asia, above all &ndash; whose native populations were
					governed by Europeans, and those &ndash; such as Canada, South Africa,
					Australia, and New Zealand &ndash; deemed capable of self-government. By 1907,
					all four had been granted dominion status. It was not a privilege extended to a
					single British African colony or to India.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature10" id="calibre_link-874"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">The Great Mineral Rush</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-875"><span><img alt="" src="images/000004.jpg" class="calibre22" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Working conditions</span> in South

					new heights towards the close of the 19th century. Discoveries of diamonds and
					gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and &ndash; most significantly of all
					&ndash; South Africa sparked a frenzy of development. Diamonds were discovered
					in South Africa’s Orange Free State in 1867, and gold in the Transvaal in
					1886. Both were independent Boer republics, established by the descendants of
					the original Dutch settlers of what had become the British Cape Colony. Their
					heightened economic importance reinforced Britain’s determination to
					annex them, which they could do only after the bitter Boer War
					(1899&ndash;1902), which stretched Britain’s military resources to their
					limits. The exploitation, both before and after the conflict, of the mineral
					resources of what in 1910 became the Union of South Africa by armies of
					underpaid black workers would later prove to be critical in the
					institutionalizing of Apartheid.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-10" class="calibre3">Marco Polo reaches Shangdu</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre3">The opening of the Amsterdam Stock

					Species</i> (1859) introduced a new scientific understanding of what
				gradually came to be known as evolution. In the book, Darwin asked a fundamental
				question. The world teems with plant and animal life: where and what had it come
				from? How had it been created?</p><p class="calibre14">Darwin was far from the first to propose that a process of change over vast
				periods had produced this diversity, but he was the first to suggest an explanatory
				theme, which he called “natural selection”.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-878"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000357.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-879" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Natural selection</h2></div><p class="calibre15">At the heart of Darwin’s idea was his contention that all animal life
					was derived from a single, common ancestor &ndash; that the ancestors of all
					mammals, humans included, for example, were fish. And in a natural world that
					was never less than relentlessly violent, only those most able to adapt would
					survive, in the process evolving into new species.</p><p class="calibre14">These views were largely formed by the around-the-world voyage he made as the
					naturalist on the British survey vessel HMS <i class="calibre5">Beagle</i> between 1831 and 1836, most of it spent in South America.
					It would take him 10 years to work up his voluminous notes and to go through all
					the samples he collected on his voyage.</p><p class="calibre14">Darwin’s book inevitably generated controversy, outraging Christian
					views that the world had been created intact and unchanging by a benevolent
					deity. Yet however heated the initial debate, quite rapidly there was widespread
					acceptance of Darwin’s views and a realization that he had made a
					decisive contribution to the understanding of the world. In the process, the
					status of science generally was immensely boosted.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-880"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000334.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The finches</span> on the Galapagos Islands

					influential in justifying imperialism, racism, and eugenics.</p><p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">On the Origin of Species</i> was published at a
					time when a growing understanding of the natural world and rapid technological
					progress meant scientific study had a greater practical worth than ever before.
					Darwin was one of the last amateur gentleman scientists in a discipline that was
					becoming professionalized as society came to view science more highly. Partly as
					a result of Darwin’s work, but also because of these changing attitudes,
					science began to have a more central place in public life. By the end of
					Darwin’s life, continual progress in scientific knowledge had become an
					almost standard expectation.</p></div><div class="section_feature7" id="calibre_link-882"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">CHARLES DARWIN<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-883"><img alt="" src="images/000307.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Charles Darwin (1809&ndash;82) was only the fifth choice for the position of
					naturalist on the voyage of the HMS <i class="calibre5">Beagle</i> in

					was constantly seasick during his time aboard the craft, Darwin proved himself
					an assiduous observer of the world around him. He would take as much amazed

					the arid wastes of the Galapagos Islands. Upon returning to England, he settled
					into a life of persistent hard work &ndash; the model high-Victorian scientist,
					aided by considerable private means and a notably happy family life, despite the

				ending royal, clerical, and aristocratic privilege. He was also driven by the goal
				of ending Austrian rule in the north of the country and by the idea of a united
				Italy. The desire to form new political entities based on common national elements

					Piedmont-Sardinia, in the northwest of Italy, a process directed by its shrewd
					and pragmatic prime minister Camillo Cavour and critically boosted by French
					military assistance in expelling the Austrians.</p><p class="calibre14">For Cavour, unification meant the creation not of a republican Italy, but of a
					centralized state under a constitutional monarchy. He believed this was the only
					way that Italy could realize its potential &ndash; above all, to press ahead
					with industrialization and compete with the leading powers of Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">The Redshirts’ forces, swelled by locals flocking to join them, soon
					overcame the ineptly led armies of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.</p><p class="calibre14">When it came to deciding upon a government for the newly united Italy &ndash;
					Venice and Rome excepted, though both would subsequently be incorporated, in
					1866 and 1870 respectively &ndash; Garibaldi recognized the inevitability of
					Piedmontese domination. In November 1860, with Garibaldi at his side, Victor
					Emmanuel II of Sardinia entered Naples. In March 1861, he was crowned king of
					Italy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-888"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000250.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Giuseppe Garibaldi</span>, in the red shirt

					illustrates the contradictions at the heart of nationalism in 19th-century
					Europe. Prompted by the notions of liberty and equal rights promised by the
					French Revolution, nationalism developed an idealistic view of a more just
					society. National groups oppressed by alien rule believed they should be able to
					assert their independence as a natural right.</p><p class="calibre14">Nationalism was furthermore characterized by a romantic view of the right of
					peoples to lay claim to their historic destinies and rule themselves:
					independence. In place of loyalty to an established ruling dynasty, new
					loyalties to national groups defined by language, culture, history, and
					self-identity were formulated. The idea of the nation-state became increasingly
					common, and likewise a belief in the right to national
					self-determination.</p><p class="calibre14">The failure of the revolutions of 1848 in central Europe and Italy, intended
					to advance these very goals, made plain the resolve of Europe’s ruling
					elites to oppose such initiatives and to preserve the Europe created by the
					Congress of Vienna in 1814&ndash;15, after the defeat of Napoleon &ndash; a
					Europe of monarchs, multinational empires, and pre-French Revolution
					frontiers.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-890" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Metternich’s failures</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The new Europe was far from stable, and the principal architect of the
					Congress of Vienna, the Austrian Prince Metternich, would later admit: “I
					have spent my life in shoring up rotten buildings.” By 1830, Belgium had
					revolted against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, of which it was a province; the
					next year, it secured its independence with British support. Similar nationalist
					uprisings followed in Poland in 1831 and in 1846, both savagely repressed by
					Russia.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-891"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"A people destined to achieve great things for the welfare of humanity must

					states across Germany. The country’s unification under the chancellorship
					of Otto von Bismarck of Prussia in 1871 and the declaration of a German empire
					jolted Europe into a new era. For Bismarck, much as they had been for Cavour,
					the benefits of unification were clear. It would be the means by which a common
					German nationality could be expressed, allowing the country to fill the need to
					underline an overarching German character that the philosopher Georg Hegel had
					identified. It would also break the dominance of Habsburg Austria over the
					German-speaking world &ndash; in particular, to lever the southern Catholic
					German states, Bavaria above all, away from Austrian influence.</p><p class="calibre14">In the interests of building this great German state, Bismarck pressed into
					service a kind of conservative nationalism. The goal was not social or
					democratic reform to establish a more just or liberal state; it was the creation
					of a country to challenge the world. German nationalism under Bismarck
					translated into a determined adoption of industrialization and the creation of
					ever larger and more efficient armed forces.</p><p class="calibre14">And it was military means that Bismarck single-mindedly deployed to create
					this new Germany. He mounted three major campaigns. The first, against Denmark
					in 1864, saw Prussia subsuming the southern Danish territories of Schleswig and
					Holstein, with Austrian support. In 1866, Prussian troops routed Austria itself;
					finally, in 1870&ndash;71, an army from across Germany comprehensively and
					humiliatingly defeated France, toppling Napoleon III’s government, and
					starving Paris into submission. These military victories underlined a seemingly
					irresistible German destiny whose logical consequence was a unified German
					empire under the Prussian king, now emperor, Wilhelm I.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-893"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000202.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Ottoman army’s brutality</span> in

					Habsburg Austrian Empire, an immense patchwork of ethnic groups across Central
					Europe under the nominal rule of Vienna. In 1867, following Austria’s
					defeat by Prussia the previous year, Hungary was able to secure almost complete
					independence from Austria. The “dual-monarchy” that resulted
					&ndash; the Austrian Empire, now the Austro-Hungarian Empire &ndash; not only
					greatly boosted an assertive sense of Hungarian self-identity but also secured
					Hungary significant territorial concessions from Vienna, notably in Transylvania
					and Croatia. Yet whatever the continuing tensions between Austria and Hungary,
					the two warily preferred to remain united precisely for fear of further
					nationalist agitations from their own splintered ethnic populations. The
					Hungarians, for example, were notably reluctant to concede the kind of political
					rights they demanded for themselves to their substantial Slovak, Romanian, and
					Serb populations. At the same time, waning Ottoman control of the Balkans also
					encouraged nationalist aspirations &ndash; Serbia, for example, had emerged as
					a more or less independent state as early as 1817. Wallachia and Moldavia,
					essentially modern Romania, could lay similar claims to independence by 1829.
					The Greeks, portraying themselves as the legatees of ancient Greek civilization,
					a role that won them support from liberals across Europe, had secured their
					independence by 1830 after a nine-year war.</p><p class="calibre14">Both Austria and Russia competed to fill the void left by the Ottomans.
					Austria’s provocative occupation of Bosnia in 1878, which it peremptorily
					annexed in 1908, would create tensions that led directly to the outbreak of
					World War I in 1914. The Balkan Wars of 1912&ndash;13 &ndash; in effect a
					bitter squabble for supremacy between Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece &ndash; were
					further evidence of the destabilizing effect of nationalist-driven state
					building.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-895"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000173.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The proclamation</span> of Wilhelm I as

					to self-determination would rarely be realized in the 1800s &ndash; Vienna
					would continue to rule over its multi-ethnic empire until its defeat at the end
					of World War I in 1918, for example. Likewise, the people of Poland were denied
					any means of exercising such nationalistic rights to self-determination. And the
					Jews of Europe remained persistently oppressed, whatever the promise of Zionism
					from the 1890s to create a Jewish nation in the Holy Land.</p></div><div class="section_feature6" id="calibre_link-897"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">OTTO VON BISMARCK<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-898"><img alt="" src="images/000146.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Minister-president of Prussia from 1862 and chancellor of Germany

					French hostility. A supreme opportunist, despite starting three wars, in 1864,
					1866, and 1870, Bismarck thereafter worked tirelessly to maintain the balance of
					power in Europe, a task in which, juggling competing interests, he was
					remarkably successful. He committed Germany to a huge programme of
					industrialization, oversaw the further growth of the German armed forces, and
					launched a programme of colonization. Despite being socially conservative,
					Bismarck also introduced the world’s first welfare system, though his

					whether so divisive an issue could be allowed to break up the United States. The
					United States, as Lincoln said, was a nation “conceived in liberty and
					dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal”, yet its
					Southern states had a population of almost 4 million black slaves. Under the
					constitution of the United States, they were legally owned property. For the
					abolitionists of the rapidly industrializing north &ndash; always a minority,
					but still exceedingly vocal &ndash; slavery was morally repugnant and an
					outrage against their Christian sensibilities.</p><p class="calibre14">However, slavery was not just the backbone of the agricultural prosperity of
					the Southern states; for slave-owning Southerners, it was a right. For them,
					“liberty” had an additional meaning: the liberty to possess
					slaves.</p><p class="calibre14">The disagreement underlined the question over States’ Rights &ndash;
					the extent to which the rights of individual states trumped the authority of the
					federal, or central, government in Washington. This question repeatedly
					resurfaced as territories in the west were settled and sought admission to the
					Union: would they be slave or “free” states?</p><p class="calibre14">The 1820 Missouri Compromise stated that slavery would be allowed only in new
					states south of a line extending westward from the southern border of Missouri.
					It was later agreed that the settlers of new states should decide for themselves
					whether theirs would be free or slave states &ndash; a decision that was
					reinforced by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Since both Kansas and Nebraska
					were to the north of Missouri’s southern border, what followed, in Kansas
					above all, was a sudden inrush of pro- and anti-slavery settlers, each desperate
					to prevail. The two sides clashed repeatedly and violently.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-910"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace, my home, my children."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Robert E Lee <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">On his resignation (April 1861)</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-911" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The South breaks away</h2></div><p class="calibre15">This conflict led to the founding of a new anti-slavery party, the
					Republicans, on whose ticket Abraham Lincoln, with practically no support from
					any slave state, was voted into office in November 1860. Lincoln’s
					victory prompted the almost immediate decision by South Carolina to secede, to
					leave the Union. By February, a further six Southern states had broken away, and
					the seven declared themselves a new nation: the Confederate States of America.
					By May, when Richmond in Virginia was made the capital of the new country, four
					more states had joined them. However, five slave states, the so-called Border
					States, opted to remain within the original Union.</p><p class="calibre14">The Confederacy argued that the Constitution had been freely adopted, and as
					such any state could legitimately break away from the Union if it felt
					oppressed. As free-born men, the citizens of the South had an
					“inalienable” right to shape their own destinies, just as the
					founding fathers had when they rejected the tyranny of British rule. In the
					minds of many Southerners, the US government was guilty of precisely the same
					kind of tyranny in seeking to limit these freedoms.</p><p class="calibre14">It was a deeply held position. As Alexander Stephens, vice-president of the
					Confederacy, asserted, the cornerstone of this new state “rest[ed] upon
					the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that
					slavery… is his natural and normal condition…”.</p><p class="calibre14">As a supreme political operator, Lincoln realized the need to proceed with
					caution. Initially at any rate, his position was that he sought only to restrict
					the expansion of slavery while preserving the Union. On the second point,
					Lincoln was immovable; he felt the authority of the federal government overrode
					that of individual states.</p><p class="calibre14">The United States, the only fully democratic country on Earth, had been
					created as what Lincoln called “a great promise to the world”, so
					ensuring its survival was an absolute moral duty. By the time of his
					Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Lincoln felt politically secure
					enough to order the freeing of all Southern slaves. But in the short term, the
					Civil War was fought to keep this “great promise” intact.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-912"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000387.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-913" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Eventual Northern victory</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The outcome of the American Civil War was dictated ultimately by the human and
					material discrepancies between the North and the South. There were 21 Union
					states with a population of 20 million, and 11 Southern states with a population
					of 9 million, 4 million of whom were slaves, and therefore not allowed to bear
					arms. Despite the fact that by 1864, 44 per cent of males in the North between
					the ages of 18 and 60 were in military service, versus 90 per cent in the
					Southern states, the North was still able to enlist 2.2 million men over the
					whole war, compared to the South’s 800,000.</p><p class="calibre14">The North was three times richer than the South. It had 3.8km (2.4 miles) of
					railroad to every 1.6km (1 mile) in the South. Its factories manufactured 10
					times more goods. It produced 20 times more iron than the South, 38 times as
					much coal, and 32 times as many firearms. The only area in which the South
					exceeded the North was in cotton production, at 24 to 1.</p><p class="calibre14">In the face of this superiority, the fact that the South was not only able to
					resist the Union forces for four years but also to come close to victory in 1862
					and 1863 was a reflection of the Southern soldiers’ profound belief in
					their cause. It was also the result of its plainly superior generals &ndash;
					the Virginian Robert E Lee above all. By contrast, at least until the emergence
					of Ulysses S Grant and William Sherman as the two leading commanders of the
					Union forces, the North had been able to muster only a succession of timid and
					inept generals who frittered away the advantages they so abundantly
					possessed.</p><p class="calibre14">Reinvigorated by Grant and Sherman, the North prevailed. The razing of Atlanta
					in September 1864 was followed by Sherman’s “march to the
					sea” at Savannah, Georgia. Completed in December, it left a
					96.5-km-(60-mile-) wide swathe of destruction, deliberately targeting civilian
					property. “War is cruelty,” Sherman asserted. “The crueller
					it is, the sooner it will be over.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-914"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000009.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This Thomas Nast</span> illustration shows

					to make widespread use of railroads, and the first widely reported in a new kind
					of popular press. There was concentrated death on a scale never seen before:
					around 670,000 dead, 50,000 of them civilians, in little more than four
					years.</p><p class="calibre14">For Abraham Lincoln, the war represented what in the Gettysburg Address he
					called “unfinished business”. The Constitution had left unresolved
					the question of how slavery could exist in a nation “conceived in
					liberty”. Despite the destruction and the huge death toll, the war
					brought a chance at “a new birth of freedom”. The end of slavery,
					confirmed by the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, represented an opportunity for
					the US to be recast as a genuinely free land for all its citizens, black and
					white.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-916"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Grant stood by me when I was crazy, and I stood by him when he was drunk,

					circles as an ignorant, socially awkward backwoodsman. By the time of his
					assassination just four years later, he had come to dominate America. Lincoln
					had not just won the Civil War, but he had also established himself as a kind of
					irresistible political oracle.</p><p class="calibre11">Born in a log cabin in Kentucky, Lincoln qualified as a lawyer by his late
					20s. He became an increasingly articulate champion of what would emerge as the
					anti-slavery Republican party. Despite having no military experience, Lincoln
					proved an increasingly shrewd judge of how the Civil War should best be fought,
					actively arguing in favour of General Grant. He never lost sight of his wider
					aims: the maintenance of American liberties and the essential dignity of
					humanity. He pushed on with the war with unflinching determination, yet he
					understood precisely what loss of life on the scale of the Civil War
					meant.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre3">The signing of the Declaration of

				“manifest destiny” of the United States lay in its expansion to the
				west was boosted immensely by the discovery of gold in a river in northern
				California in January 1848. Even allowing for the inevitable difficulties of
				communication and travel at the time, the find sparked a frenzied reaction. Over the
				next five years, as many as 300,000 “49ers” &ndash; a reference to
				the year in which the influx began in earnest &ndash; were drawn to what, in 1850,
				would become the 31st state of the USA. The immediate consequence was both a wild
				lawlessness in the pursuit of instant riches and the confirmation of
				America’s Pacific coast as a promised land. The population of San Francisco,
				the main point of entry, was hardly 200 in 1846. By 1852, it was more than 30,000;
				and by 1870, it was 150,000.</p><p class="calibre14">A handful, mostly early arrivals, made fortunes, while some made modest profits,
				and most made nothing at all. The California gold rush seemed a national obsession.
				In reality, it was no more than an extreme instance of the determination to colonize
				North America by the United States that was under way long before the gold had been
				found. By 1803, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio had become states. In
				addition to the annexation of Texas in 1845, a further 13 states had been added by
				1848. In the same year, New Mexico and California were also seized from
				Mexico.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-921"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000338.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-922" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">New technologies</h2></div><p class="calibre15">To reach California, the 49ers endured journeys of astonishing hardship,
					travelling by wagon across the immensities of the Great Plains or by ship around
					Cape Horn, and sometimes across the Isthmus of Panama. Six months was the
					expected minimum for these enormous undertakings.</p><p class="calibre14">However, an extraordinary resolution to link these vast new territories was
					being forged, harnessing new technology in pursuit of nation-building on an epic
					scale. In 1861, the first telegraph line was established between the east and
					the west coasts. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad line was
					completed, slashing journey times: by 1876, it was possible to travel from New
					York to California in three and a half days.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-923"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000313.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">John Gast’s painting </span><i class="calibre19">American Progress</i> (1872) depicts the

					million. By 1861, it was 31 million; and by the turn of the century, 76 million.
					There were inevitable costs to such rapid growth, and Native Americans paid the
					highest price. Driven off their tribal lands with relentless brutality, their
					numbers dropped from perhaps as many as 4.5 million to 500,000. Herded into
					reservations, their traditional way of life destroyed, they were helpless in the

					Dakota after gold was discovered there. By doing so, however, it broke a treaty
					with the Sioux of the Great Plains. When, in return, substantial numbers of
					Sioux and Cheyenne refused to move to reservations, federal cavalry were sent to
					Montana to round them up. Among them was a troop of 600 under Lieutenant Colonel
					George Custer. Some 200 of these men, led by Custer himself, discovered the
					Indian encampment in the Little Bighorn Valley. In just one hour, the combined
					Native American warriors, led by Sitting Bull, killed Custer’s entire
					force. Their deaths renewed the government’s determination to force the
					Sioux and Cheyenne into reservations at any cost.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre3">The signing of the Declaration of

				boom in population, particularly in Europe. This increase would continue into the
				20th century and beyond. It was partly due to improvements in health, backed by more
				ready access to food as a consequence of improved agricultural methods. It was also
				a result of industrialization and urban growth, as well as the affluence and
				improved living standards that both produced. Political stability played a role,
				too. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Europe enjoyed almost 100 years of
				largely unbroken peace.</p><p class="calibre14">Nature also had a hand in the increase in migration. The Irish potato famine of
				the 1840s, resulting from a failed crop, may have been the last major European
				famine, but it brought suffering on a startling scale: up to 1 million people died.
				It provoked among survivors a vast wave of emigration of over 1 million, almost all
				to the US. The population of Ireland in 1841 was 6.5 million; by 1871, it had dipped
				to 4 million.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-928"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000259.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-929" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Urban underclass</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Industrialization produced a similar paradox. Whatever the civic pride and

					especially in Britain, a new urban underclass was being created, desperately
					impoverished and living in extreme squalor.</p><p class="calibre14">For the citizens of continental Europe, the lure of new lands in which to be
					free and prosper would prove irresistible. Substantial numbers of Germans,
					Czechs, and Hungarians left central Europe after the suppression of the
					nationalist revolts of 1848. From 1870, huge numbers of Russian and Polish Jews
					&ndash; 1.5 million in 1901&ndash;10 alone &ndash; similarly emigrated,
					fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms.</p><p class="calibre14">The numbers involved in this huge transfer of populations were remarkable.
					From the mid-19th century to 1924, 18 million people emigrated from Britain; 9.5
					million from Italy, mostly from its deprived south; 8 million from Russia; 5
					million from Austria-Hungary, and 4.5 million from Germany. Between 1820 and
					1920, the US attracted 33.6 million immigrants, where they often found
					themselves in poor living conditions in rapidly expanding cities such as Chicago
					and New York, aiding the growth of American industry with their cheap labour.
					Over the same period, 3.6 million Europeans settled in South America, and 2

					overhaul of the education system, and in 1877 Japan’s first university
					was established in Tokyo. Japan also introduced a new legal code in 1882, and a

				Second Opium War, an Anglo-French force seized the imperial capital of Peking (today
				Beijing), in China, to force the Chinese to submit to trading concessions. The point
				was underlined when the Europeans burned down the emperor’s sumptuous Summer
				Palace. The Chinese agreed to talks, and the resulting Peking Convention not only
				increased the number of Treaty Ports open to Western trade, but British and French
				zones of influence were extended in south China and along the fertile Yangtze
				River.</p><p class="calibre14">Less than 70 years before, Britain had sent an embassy to China to open trade
				talks, only to be rebuffed. Late 18th-century Qing China was the richest, most
				populous, and most powerful country in the world, and it could afford its
				complacency. By the mid-19th century, however, the nation was effectively bankrupt,
				racked by famines and revolts, and increasingly exploited and humiliated by the
				West.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-944"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000214.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-945" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Uprisings and revolts</h2></div><p class="calibre15">China’s problems were internal as much as external. A swelling
					population &ndash; 100 million in 1650, 300 million in 1800, 450 million in
					1850 &ndash; provoked recurring famines. Between 1787 and 1813, there were
					three major uprisings. Its border provinces, conquered at huge expense in the
					17th and 18th centuries, were in a near-permanent state of unrest.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1850, the Taiping Rebellion erupted across central China, resulting in the
					death of as many as 20 million people. When it was finally put down, in 1864, it
					was only after Western intervention. The Qing dynasty, its administration
					increasingly ineffective, had essentially lost control of China.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-946"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000059.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The port of Canton</span>, in southern China,

					in the process. The first, modest trading concessions China had agreed to
					stipulated that all Chinese goods be paid for in silver. However, from the early
					19th century, European traders, mostly by bribing officials, were increasingly
					able to use opium, cheaply grown in India, to pay for goods. By the 1820s, 5,000
					chests of opium a year were entering China.</p><p class="calibre14">The Chinese attempt to end the opium trade and its debilitating effects led to
					a crushing defeat in the First Opium War of 1839&ndash;42, with the European
					powers, Britain above all, extracting substantial trading concessions. It was
					Western insistence in 1856 that these concessions be extended that led to the
					Second Opium War, concluded in 1860 by the Peking Convention. By 1900, a string
					of Western trading ports were scattered along the Chinese coast. Britain,
					France, Japan, and Russia now all controlled what had been Chinese tributary
					states on its borders. China, wracked by turmoil, was effectively
					disintegrating.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-948"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">The Boxer Rebellion</h4><p class="intro">In the turmoil of late 19th-century China, it was inevitable that efforts
					would be mounted to end the growing dominance of the West. The imperial
					government in Beijing made a last-ditch attempt at reform on Western lines, but
					the chaos came to a head in 1899 with the Boxer Rebellion, mounted by the
					Militia United in Righteousness, a semi-secret society composed mostly of young
					men. Its goal, to be achieved in part thanks to their deluded belief that they
					were invulnerable to Western weapons, was the overthrow of all Western
					interests. The rebellion was variously supported and opposed by the imperial
					court, uncertain whether it represented a means of salvation or would merely
					provoke Western reprisals. The latter proved to be the case. An eight-nation
					military alliance, including Japan, was sent into China against the Boxers, and
					by September 1901 the rebellion had been crushed, amid scenes of indiscriminate
					violence.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-63" class="calibre3">Stephenson’s <i class="calibre5">Rocket</i> enters service</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-84" class="calibre3">The construction of the Suez Canal</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-23" class="calibre3">The Siege of Lucknow</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-55" class="calibre3">The Meiji Restoration</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-147" class="calibre3">The Taiping Rebellion</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-72" class="calibre3">The Long March</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				structure in the world, but a triumphant monument to technological progress.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-951"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000016.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The Eiffel Tower</span> was erected in time for

					emperor had whole districts knocked down, replacing medieval buildings and
					tangles of tiny streets with imposingly vast boulevards. It was urban planning
					on a scale never seen before. Train stations were built, water supplies
					improved, sewers constructed, parks laid out, and stunning vistas created. The
					goal was a model city, one that would reflect not just the glory of France but
					also its mastery of the modern age.</p><p class="calibre14">It was a process mirrored in cities across the industrial West. In 1850, there
					were three European cities with populations larger than 500,000: Paris, London,
					and Constantinople. Fifty years later, there were nine with populations larger
					than 1 million, and by 1900, London was the largest city in the world, with 6.5
					million inhabitants. The same dizzying growth occurred in the USA, too &ndash;
					between 1850 and 1900, the population of Chicago, for example, tripled, from
					560,000 to 1.7 million.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-953"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000392.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-954" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Difficulties and inventions</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The initial consequence of this population explosion was quite staggering
					urban squalor. Diseases such as cholera and typhoid were commonplace. It became
					clear that the infrastructure demanded by any modern city had to include not
					just adequate public transport and well-lit streets, for example, but major
					improvements in public health &ndash; above all, sanitation.</p><p class="calibre14">The shift in the quality of life in these great metropolises was
					extraordinary. It was paralleled by the rapid development of mass consumerism,
					the direct consequence of improved living standards, shorter working hours, and
					compulsory education, with basic literacy and numeracy now increasingly
					commonplace. It was an age of music halls and popular theatre, and subsequently
					of the cinema; of the phonograph; of mass-circulation newspapers; and of a
					growing interest in sports.</p><p class="calibre14">Just as central to this age of growing affluence and increased leisure
					&ndash; at least for some &ndash; were the first department stores. These were
					a conspicuous part of a retail revolution that was coupled, from the 1870s, with
					an advertising explosion, with colour posters mass-produced for the first time.
					And from the 1890s in the United States, cityscapes were further changed by a
					new type of building: skyscrapers. Just as the Eiffel Tower before them, they
					rapidly became symbols of the transformation in urban life.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-955"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Underground railways</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-956"><span><img alt="" src="images/000367.jpg" class="calibre22" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In 1890, London</span> unveiled the

					square mile to 90,366, and the congestion was worsening as public transportation
					took up valuable land. A solution favoured in the United States was an elevated
					railway &ndash; a train line raised above the streets on steel girders. The
					first was opened in New York in 1868.</p><p class="calibre11">In the UK, the same space constraints led to the birth of the underground
					railway. The first, using conventional steam engines, was London’s
					Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 and linked Paddington and
					King’s Cross stations with the City of London. Soon extended and combined
					with the District Line, by 1871 it encircled almost the whole of central London.
					The city’s first electric underground service &ndash; faster, quieter,
					and much less dirty &ndash; was opened in 1890. Paris followed suit with the
					opening of the Métro, named after the London line, in 1900, and the first

				right to impose itself on a continent deemed backwards, ignorant, and savage. Called

				setting agreed rules of colonization, to avoid conflict between Europe’s
				colonial powers, France and Britain most obviously.</p><p class="calibre14">It was also seen as a way to end the slave trade, not least by the actions of
				Christian missionaries. At the same time, it paved the way for Germany and Belgium,
				two nations with no history of colonial rule, to become major imperial powers. For
				Germany, this was little more than a logical next step in its challenge to Britain

					the slave trade. The interior remained impenetrable, but as it was revealed from
					the early 1800s, European control of Africa gained momentum.</p><p class="calibre14">The subsequent heightening of tensions resulted in the near-complete reduction
					of Africa to European rule. African colonies were essentially artificial

					it is believed that between 2 million and 10 million Congolese died. Conditions
					in German southwest Africa, suddenly taken over after 1884 and today part of

					of Africa: Cape Town and Cairo. Having made his fortune mining and selling
					diamonds in South Africa, he dedicated the rest of his life to this audacious
					vision. He was able to carve out new British territories in Northern Rhodesia
					(now part of Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which were both named
					after him. As the prime minister of Britain’s Cape Colony from 1890, his
					relentless scheming to topple the Boer republics led to his eventual political
					demise in 1895. He remains perhaps the most striking example of the unashamed
					imperialist, not just permanently ready to extend British colonial control, but
					convinced that it was his duty to do so in the interests of what seemed to him a

					effectively agreeing to the establishment of a new Turkish republic,
					Atatürk launched a radical programme of social and political reforms

					In 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst founded the WSPU with the aim of using militant

					decisions &ndash; in this case, Prohibition &ndash; without having the
					vote.</p><p class="calibre14">However, the National Women’s Party (NWP), established in 1916,
					imitated the militant tactics of Britain’s WSPU. This was no surprise,
					given that its founder, Alice Paul, had been a member of the WSPU from 1907 to
					1910 and had been sent to prison three times. The NWP’s so-called Silent

					that traditionally expected of them as wives and mothers. In 1918, all British
					women aged 30 or over were granted the right to vote. In 1928, suffrage in
					Britain was extended to women aged 21 or over.</p><p class="calibre14">Meanwhile, in the United States, the NWP continued its protest into 1919, when

				inevitably shifting and uncertain. A historian writing in the mid-20th century might
				have characterized the modern era as a period of catastrophe, in which all the
				economic and political gains of liberal civilization had been squandered. However,
				by the early 21st century it was tempting to see continuity with the pre-1914 world,
				as a globalized capitalist economy and great technological innovation were combined
				with rapidly rising population and productivity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-986"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000220.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-987" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The two world wars</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The convulsions of the period from 1914 to 1950 were on an epic scale. Two
					world wars between them caused the deaths of between 70 and 100 million people,
					making them by far the most destructive conflicts in history. Both European
					civilization and science &ndash; the twin pillars of the traditional
					19th-century idea of “progress” &ndash; were tarnished by
					association with this slaughter. Germany, often considered one of
					Europe’s most “civilized” countries, descended into
					dictatorship and genocidal massacre. Science was used to create weapons of mass
					destruction, from poison gas to the atom bomb. Even in the interlude of relative
					peace between the world wars, global capitalism failed to function effectively,
					the economic misery of the Great Depression driving a retreat from democratic
					government and free markets.</p><p class="calibre14">To revolutionaries inspired by a Marxist vision, these upheavals seemed the
					death throes of the capitalist order. But the building of alternative
					“communist” societies, based on the model of a single-party state
					and a state-controlled economy, proved to be a costly experiment. In Russia,
					followed by China, communism succeeded in transforming relatively backward
					countries into major industrial and military powers, but millions died as
					victims of the state, and citizens were denied fundamental freedoms.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-988" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A battle of ideology</h2></div><p class="calibre15">World War II was followed by the Cold War confrontation between the
					“free world”, led by the United States, and the communist bloc.
					Instead of disarmament, there was a potentially disastrous nuclear arms race.
					Meanwhile, the main European powers, economically weakened and demoralized,
					found themselves in no position to sustain their empires against colonized
					populations eager for freedom. The newly independent nations became an
					ideological and even, at times, military battleground between the capitalist and
					communist systems.</p><p class="calibre14">In the end, the issue was settled by economics. Capitalism showed its ability
					to generate economic growth on a vast scale, creating a booming consumer society
					in more advanced countries. In contrast, by the 1980s communist countries
					confronted economic stagnation and rising popular discontent. With great
					rapidity, communist regimes collapsed in the Soviet bloc, while communist China
					later became a powerhouse of capitalism.</p><p class="calibre14">In the wake of communism, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama coined the
					expression the “end of history” and argued that Western liberal
					democracy was “the only game in town”. Certainly, by the end of
					the 20th century liberalism was surfing a wave: in 1950, only a few nations in
					Europe were democracies; 50 years later, all of them were.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-989" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Progress and pessimism</h2></div><p class="calibre15">From the 1960s, hotly contested campaigns for civil rights had progressed
					liberal ideals in areas such as racial equality and gender politics. Growing
					prosperity was also impressive. In Latin America and much of Asia, living
					standards had risen dramatically by the early 21st century. Despite the
					world’s population increasing on a huge scale &ndash; from under 2
					billion in 1914 to over 7 billion one century later &ndash; food supplies had
					not run out, as had once been predicted by many. Restricting environmental
					damage was recognized as a major challenge for the future, a problem generated
					by humanity’s growth and success.</p><p class="calibre14">Indeed, human progress in the 20th century was remarkable, from rising
					literacy and life expectancy to the development of air and space travel and
					computers. Yet there was no outbreak of general optimism. Environmental issues
					aside, it was all too evident that the future held potential dangers: the
					unsettled politics of the Middle East, sucking major powers into wars; brutal
					acts of terrorism; economic inequality generating mass migration; financial
					instability and market breakdown; epidemics spread by global travel &ndash; all
					provided plenty of material for pessimists. History offered no solid ground for
					predictions, suggesting only that the unexpected was to be expected.</p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				village of Passchendaele.</p><p class="calibre14">Preparations for the battle began on 7 June 1917 with a heavy two-week bombardment
				of German positions. The infantry offensive began on 31 July 1917. Within days, the
				Allied forces were stuck in mud as torrential rain turned the area into a quagmire.
				By the time the Allies &ndash; made up of British, French, Canadian, and Australian
				troops &ndash; captured Passchendaele on 6 November, the village was in ruins. The
				conflict cost 300,000 Allied lives, with a gain of 8km (5 miles), while the Germans
				lost 260,000 of their troops. It was hailed as a victory by the British government
				but became a byword for the utter futility of war.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-992"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000379.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Soldiers at Passchendaele</span> fought in

					other between Russia and Austria-Hungary. The long history of mutual antipathy
					between Germany and France came to a head in 1870 with France’s
					humiliating defeat by Germany in the Franco-Prussian war, which led to the
					annexation of most of the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.</p><p class="calibre14">In Eastern Europe, the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires had a
					long-standing dispute over which of them had the strongest claim to power in the
					Balkans. Both depended on the area for access to the Mediterranean, and each
					eyed the movements of the other with intense suspicion.</p><p class="calibre14">Each state needed allies, and in 1882 Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy
					signed a Triple Alliance promising to give each other military support in case
					of war. Then, in the 1890s, Russia and France signed an agreement to protect one
					another in the event of a war against Germany. By the turn of the century,
					Kaiser Wilhelm II’s provocative nationalistic speeches and naval
					expansion pushed Britain into closer ties with France. In 1904, Britain and
					France agreed an <i class="calibre5">entente cordiale</i>, or
					friendly alliance, which was broadened into a triple entente, embracing Russia,
					in 1907. The triple entente would become known as the Allied Powers. The
					atmosphere generated by this international jostling led to an increase in
					military spending by European governments and the expansion of armies and
					navies.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-994"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again

					two alliances. It came on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb assassinated
					Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, in Sarajevo. The
					Austrians suspected Serbia, their principal enemy in the Balkans, of the attack.
					After securing support from its ally Germany, Austria-Hungary presented Serbia
					with an ultimatum on 23 July, demanding that the Serbs stop all
					anti-Austria-Hungary activities. Serbia accepted most of the demands, but
					Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July. Britain called for
					international mediation, but the crisis quickly escalated into European war.
					When Russia mobilized against Austria-Hungary, Germany declared war on Russia on
					1 August, and on France two days later. Britain joined the war on 4 August,
					after the Germans invaded neutral Belgium. The British Expeditionary Force
					(BEF), a small professional troop led by Sir Douglas Haig, had arrived in France
					by 22 August. It was deployed near the Franco-Belgian border, in line with
					pre-war military plans agreed with the French government.</p><p class="calibre14">Germany had to fight a war on two fronts. On the Western Front, in the first
					weeks of the conflict, the Germans invaded Belgium and France, but their advance
					was halted by the French and British at the Battle of the Marne. By the end of
					the autumn, the two sides had reached a stalemate. Meanwhile, on the Eastern
					Front, the fighting remained fluid. Germany dominated, scoring a great victory
					against the Russians at Tannenberg, but its Austrian allies suffered several
					defeats. On the Western Front, however, a 645km (400-mile) trench line stretched
					from the Belgian coast in the north, down through eastern France to the Swiss
					border. The two sides faced each other across the open space between their front
					lines. This area &ndash; no-man’s-land &ndash; had barbed wire fronting
					the trenches to slow the opposition. Continuous fighting from the trenches,
					punctuated by appallingly bloody battles, failed to break the deadlock. More
					than 600,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme
					alone.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-997"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000011.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Huge artillery guns</span> such as the

					short, decisive battle. No one had anticipated a war of attrition. New
					mechanized weapons added to the high casualty rates. Tanks were used for the
					first time, and machine guns such as the German MG 08 Maxim could fire up to 600
					bullets a minute. Aircraft, first employed for reconnaissance, were later used
					for bombing. Both sides used poison gas. Horses were the backbone of logistical
					operations, but as the war progressed, railways and motor trucks were used to
					transport goods to the front.</p><p class="calibre14">Civilians were brought into the front line by the bombing of London and Paris
					by airships and bomber aircraft. By 1917, German submarines were sinking one in
					four merchant ships headed for Britain to try to starve the British into
					submission. Britain’s naval blockade of Germany also led to acute food
					shortages. This was the first “total war”, meaning not just
					soldiers but also civilian populations were involved.</p><p class="calibre14">Britain was forced to introduce conscription for the first time in its
					history. From January 1916, all single men aged 18 to 41 could be called up.
					Britain and France also assembled armies from their overseas colonies, such as
					India and Africa, and from the British dominions of Australia, New Zealand, and
					Canada. War brought many social changes, notably for women, who filled positions
					in factories and offices. Women were also increasingly employed in the munitions
					industry as governments switched to large-scale production.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-999"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"There was not a sign of life of any sort… Not a bird, not even a

					the conflict soon became a world war. German colonies in China and the Pacific
					were invaded by Japan, which entered the war on the side of the Allies.
					Germany’s colonies in Africa were overrun by British, French, and South
					African troops. In May 1915, Italy joined the Allies, fighting Austria-Hungary
					and Germany in the Alps.</p><p class="calibre14">In early November 1914, the Ottoman Empire, an Islamic power, abandoned its
					neutrality and declared a military <i class="calibre5">jihad</i>
					(holy war) against France, Russia, and Britain. The US was drawn into the war by
					German submarine attacks on commercial ships at sea, such as the one on British
					liner <i class="calibre5">Lusitania</i> in 1915, with 128 Americans
					on board. After a German plot to persuade Mexico into an anti-US alliance was
					discovered, Congress declared war in April 1917.</p><p class="calibre14">When the Bolsheviks in Russia negotiated a peace treaty with Germany at
					Brest-Litovsk on 22 December 1917, it seemed Germany had won a significant
					victory. They also made gains on the Western Front in 1918, but then, in July
					and August, the Allies counterattacked, beginning an advance that would continue
					until November. Four million fresh US troops helped defeat the Central Powers
					and bring the Germans to the peace table.</p><p class="calibre14">When the conflict ended, at 11am on 11 November 1918, the alliance led by
					France and Britain emerged victorious. More than 65 million troops had been
					involved in the war, of which at least half were killed or injured. The Russian,
					Austrian, and German empires had collapsed. After the war, the Treaty of
					Versailles redrew the map of Europe, leaving nations, particularly Germany,
					embittered. A public assembly of countries, the League of Nations, was founded
					to help maintain peace. However, the League proved toothless in the face of
					countries that chose to ignore it. When fascist Benito Mussolini came to power
					in Italy in 1922, he denounced the Treaty. In Germany, where the response to the
					Treaty was one of deep resentment, the Nazi Party began to gain momentum. Far
					from being “the war to end all wars”, World War I had instead sown
					the seeds of future conflict.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1002"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000001.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">One of the social changes</span> brought on by

				World War I. There were food shortages, and workers in the cities faced low wages
				and appalling conditions. The February Revolution had ousted the Tsar, but the
				Provisional Government that replaced him faced imminent collapse.</p><p class="calibre14">Vladimir Lenin, a member of the revolutionary Bolshevik Party, took full
				advantage. He was committed to a workers’ (proletarian) revolution and set
				out a series of proposals to overthrow the government in what became known as his
				April Theses. His simple slogan “Peace, land, and bread!” became a
				revolutionary rallying cry. On 24 October (6 November, Gregorian calendar (GC)),
				there were attempts by the government to curb the activities of the Bolsheviks to
				prevent a coup. Orders were issued for the arrest of leading party members, and
				their newspaper, <i class="calibre5">Pravda</i> (The Truth), was closed
				down. Lenin, keeping a low profile in his apartment, urged action. “We must
				not wait! We may lose everything! The government is tottering. To delay action is
				the same as death,” he wrote.</p><p class="calibre14">On 25 October (7 November, GC), the government tried without success to find armed
				support. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers party, of which the Bolsheviks
				were a faction, could rely on the support of troops in Petrograd (later St
				Petersburg). The Bolshevik paramilitary Red Guards occupied the main telegraph
				office, post office, and power stations. Only the Winter Palace, the seat of the
				government, remained. The small unit of military cadets guarding it willingly
				surrendered to the revolutionary soldiers. The regime was overthrown, and power had
				passed to Lenin and his Bolsheviks.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1007"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000321.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-1008" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Laying the groundwork</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The October Revolution was the culmination of the civil unrest that had
					rumbled on for months. On 23 February 1917 (8 March, GC), in Petrograd, a riot
					had started, led by women frustrated at waiting hours for bread. They marched
					through the city, gathering support as they went. This grew into a general
					strike, and the demonstrations took on a more political nature. Red flags began
					to appear, and statues of Tsar Nicholas II were toppled. Soldiers refused to
					obey orders to fire on the crowd, but police shot and killed 50 people.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1009" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Rise of revolutionary parties</h2></div><p class="calibre15">With violence erupting on city streets, the Tsar abdicated in March, having
					relinquished power to the Provisional Government in February, with Prince Georgi
					Y Lvov as its head. The government still represented only the middle classes and
					continued to back Russia’s involvement in World War I. Groups such as the
					Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers, a council made up of workers and
					peasants agitating for change, grew stronger and gained power within the
					Provisional Government. Lenin, in exile for revolutionary activities, was
					anxious to return to Petrograd, convinced that the collapse of world capitalism
					was imminent. He received the help of the German government, which hoped that he
					could further destabilize the political situation in Russia for their war
					effort, and arrived secretly in a sealed train. Full of revolutionary zeal, he
					was determined to shape a new Russian government according to his ideas, and he
					accused his associates of not doing enough to overthrow the current
					regime.</p><p class="calibre14">Prime Minister Lvov resigned after the disastrous July Offensive on the
					Western Front. His successor, Alexander Kerensky, formed a new socialist
					government with the Petrograd Soviet, but he, too, insisted on keeping Russia in
					the war. After mass demonstrations in Petrograd encouraged by the Bolsheviks,
					Kerensky banned them and arrested many of their leaders. Lenin fled to
					Finland.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1010" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Revolution is nigh</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In August, Kerensky faced a new threat. General Lavr Kornilov, Russia’s
					army commander-in-chief, ordered troops into Petrograd. Kerensky believed that
					Kornilov was plotting to seize power. In desperation, he released the
					Bolsheviks, who armed those who wanted to prevent a counter-revolution. This was
					a massive boost for their cause. They were able to represent themselves to the
					people as defenders of Petrograd. By September the Bolsheviks had taken control
					of the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin seized the moment, returned to Russia, and
					renewed calls for revolution. He handed responsibility for military tactics to
					Leon Trotsky, a fellow Marxist. Peasants and farmers were revolting in rural
					areas, workers in the cities. Lenin decided the time was ripe for a Bolshevik
					seizure of power. The Bolsheviks took government buildings and the Winter
					Palace, where Kerensky’s cabinet had sought refuge.</p><p class="calibre14">On the night of 25 October (7 November, GC), Lenin issued a brief address to
					the Russian people: “The Provisional Government has been overthrown. Long
					live the workers, soldiers, and peasant revolution!” After this initial
					triumph, Lenin was compelled to hold democratic elections, but the Bolsheviks
					received only a quarter of the vote. Lenin dissolved the elected government and
					sent armed guards to prevent it meeting again. In February 1918, he signed a
					peace treaty with Germany, but the terms were extremely harsh. Russia ceded the
					Baltic States to Germany, while Ukraine, Finland, and Estonia were transformed
					into independent states. Russia was also forced to pay six billion German marks
					in reparations. This move freed the Bolsheviks from the German threat, but the
					terms of the treaty were deeply unpopular. Many regarded it as a betrayal of
					their country.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1011"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"The execution of the Tsar and his family was needed not only to…

					established a highly centralized government system, banned all opposition, and
					started the Red Terror, a campaign of intimidation, executions, and arrests
					against anybody perceived to be a threat to the Bolsheviks.</p><p class="calibre14">The Bolsheviks were a minority in Russia, and their opponents marshalled their
					forces against them, primarily the Whites, made up of former tsarists, army
					officers, and democrats. The Bolsheviks were known as the Reds.</p><p class="calibre14">As various factions fought over the future of the country, a civil war
					characterized by extreme violence erupted in Russia and ran from 1918 to 1921.
					The Whites received help from Russia’s former allies &ndash; Britain,
					France, the US, and Japan &ndash; which feared the spread of communism. At
					first, they made significant gains. However, they were badly coordinated, and
					Trotsky proved to be a brilliant military tactician.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1920, Lenin ordered a war against Poland to liberate the workers of eastern
					and central Europe, but at the Battle of Warsaw, after a magnificent
					counterattack, the Red Army was driven back.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1014"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000350.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Vladimir Lenin</span> addresses his troops in

					attention to rebuilding the Russian economy.</p><p class="calibre14">He faced a country on the verge of collapse. In the countryside, around 6
					million peasants had died of starvation, and there was rioting in the cities.
					The Kronstadt naval rebellion in March 1921 further undermined the regime.
					Kronstadt was a naval town on an island off the coast of Petrograd. In 1921,
					16,000 soldiers and workers signed a petition calling for “Soviets
					without Bolsheviks”: freely elected Soviets and freedoms of speech and
					press. The Reds reacted ruthlessly, executing several hundred ringleaders and
					expelling over 15,000 sailors from the fleet.</p><p class="calibre14">In May 1922, Lenin suffered a stroke. In December, the Soviet government
					declared the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), a
					federal union consisting of Soviet Russia and neighbouring areas that were ruled
					by branches of the communist movement. From its inception, the USSR was based on
					a premise of one-party rule, prohibiting all other political
					organizations.</p><p class="calibre14">Lenin was disheartened by political infighting and worried about how the USSR
					would be run after his death. In late 1922 and early 1923, he dictated what
					became known as his “testament”, in which he expressed regret at
					the direction the Soviet government had taken. He was especially critical of
					Joseph Stalin, then general secretary of the Communist Party. Stalin’s
					aggressive behaviour had brought him into conflict with Lenin.</p><p class="calibre14">Lenin died in 1924, but his legacy lives on. The Bolshevik Party’s
					establishment of the world’s first socialist state in the largest nation
					affected every country in the world. The victorious socialist revolution
					inspired workers with an alternative to capitalism and old imperialist
					regimes.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature9" id="calibre_link-1016"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">VLADIMIR ILYICH LENIN<span class="calibre24"></span></h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-1017"><img alt="" src="images/000188.jpg" class="calibre22" /></div><p class="intro">Born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov on 10 April 1870 (22 April, NS), the founder of

				communist plot to bring down the government &ndash; a cynical ploy that gave Hitler
				an excuse to decimate his communist rivals.</p><p class="calibre14">The timing was perfect: elections were due to take place in March 1933. While
				Hitler’s National Socialist, or “Nazi”, Party was the largest
				party in parliament, he lacked a working majority because the two next-largest
				parties (the Social Democrats and Communists) were both on the left, and he feared
				his party would not fare well in the elections. Hitler rushed to blame the fire on a
				lone Dutch communist, which prompted suspicions that the Nazis were behind the
				arson, given that they had so much to gain from discrediting the communists.</p><p class="calibre14">The next day, the Reichstag Fire Decree banned the Communist Party.
				Hitler’s response fed on fears of a communist takeover, and many Germans
				believed that Hitler’s decisive action had saved the nation. By April, under
				pressure from the Nazis, the Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag. This granted
				Hitler the right to make his own laws without involving the Reichstag, and it
				solidified his place as a fascist dictator with complete control over

					were set up as defenders against communism. They used paramilitary groups to

				offered the best hope of Soviet security. One week later, on 1 September 1939, more
				than a million German troops invaded Poland from the west. Soon after, on 17
				September, Russian troops attacked Poland from the east. The context for this
				unprovoked assault, as declared by the German <i class="calibre5">Führer</i>, Adolf Hitler, was the pursuit of <i class="calibre5">Lebensraum</i>, “living space” deemed
				necessary for the expansion of the German people, whom Hitler saw as a superior
				“Aryan master race”, with the right to displace inferior races.</p><p class="calibre14">The invasion lasted just over a month. Trapped between two huge, well-armed
				powers, the Polish air force and army fought valiantly, but they lacked modern
				aircraft and tanks. The German Luftwaffe was quickly able to gain command of the
				skies. In the end, Poland’s aviators and soldiers, fighting on two fronts,
				were overwhelmed.</p><p class="calibre14">The invasion ended in a resounding victory, and it added to Hitler’s

					origins can be traced back to Germany’s defeat in World War I and the
					demand for reparation payments. The defeated nations lost land and prestige,
					causing deep resentment. Germany was forced to return Alsace and Lorraine to
					France, and all of its overseas colonies were annexed by the Allies.</p><p class="calibre14">Germany’s Weimar Republic began its economic recovery in the 1920s, but
					it could not survive the blow that was inflicted by the US economic crash of
					1929. This financial crisis aided the rise of the National Socialist (Nazi)
					Party, led by Hitler, who promised the German people he would make the nation
					great again.</p><p class="calibre14">Hitler had fought in World War I, and the experience of trench warfare, the
					shock of defeat, and the terms of the Versailles Treaty were to influence the
					rest of his life. He developed extremist views based on far-right nationalism;
					and by the time he became chancellor of Germany’s coalition government in
					1933, and dictator of the country the next year, he ruthlessly pursued his
					policies of nationalism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1047" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Hitler’s <i class="calibre19">Lebensraum</i></h2></div><p class="calibre15">Under this creed, Hitler embarked on an ambitious foreign policy. In 1935,
					openly going against the terms of the Versailles Treaty, he began a massive
					programme of re-armament. In 1936 he occupied the demilitarized Rhineland, but
					none of the major powers intervened. In March 1938, Hitler annexed Austria to
					Germany, before setting his sights on the German-speaking part of
					Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland. British and French politicians wanted to avoid
					a repeat of the horrors of World War I and felt that the Sudetenland was not
					worth fighting for. In the Munich Agreement of 29 September 1938, the
					Sudetenland was handed to Hitler in exchange for his promise to end his
					land-grabs. British prime minister Neville Chamberlain declared that he had
					secured “peace for our time”, only for the Nazis to invade the
					remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1048"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000067.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Adolf Hitler</span> watches a victory parade

					Fascist challenge was provided the same year, when both Mussolini and Hitler
					sent “volunteers” to fight in the Spanish Civil War, to aid

					on 3 September, which meant British and French colonies were also drawn into

					Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France, but neither Britain nor France attempted an
					offensive against Germany. They were not ready for a large-scale attack, and
					some politicians still believed that peace terms could be negotiated.</p><p class="calibre14">This period became known as the “Phoney War”. Expecting to be
					bombed, Britain began to evacuate its children from major cities. Air-raid
					shelters were built, and gas masks handed out. The Phoney War ended in April
					1940, when Germany attacked and conquered Denmark and Norway. A month later,
					they turned on France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The French army was poorly
					led and badly equipped. France had relied on the Maginot Line, a chain of
					fortresses along the frontier with Germany, to halt any attack. But the
					fortification did not extend along the Franco-Belgian border, and the Germans
					simply bypassed it at the north end. Within the space of six weeks, France had
					fallen to the German onslaught.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1052"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on

					before they could be evacuated by sea from Dunkirk. Thousands of Allied soldiers
					were transferred across the Channel in all kinds of vessels in Operation Dynamo.
					Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty and later Britain’s
					wartime prime minister, told the British parliament, “The Battle of
					France is over. I expect the Battle of Britain is about to begin.”</p><p class="calibre14">However, Hitler’s attempts to invade Britain in Operation Sea Lion had
					to be abandoned after the Luftwaffe failed to win the battle of the skies. With
					the Luftwaffe triumphant in both Poland and France, the Germans had hoped that
					Britain could be beaten by air power alone. However, German crews were
					exhausted, intelligence was poor, and Britain’s use of radar enabled the
					Royal Air Force (RAF) to track incoming planes and take off in time to meet an
					attack. The Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940 was the first real check on
					Hitler’s progress, but Britain alone could not fight a power that now had
					control of almost the entire continent.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1054"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000352.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Operation Dynamo</span>, in June 1940, focused

					Italy, emboldened by German successes, declared war on Britain and France,
					fulfilling the terms of the Axis agreement made between Hitler and Mussolini on
					22 May 1939. But Italy’s failures in Greece and North Africa forced
					Hitler to send German armies into these areas, as well as Yugoslavia.</p><p class="calibre14">On 7 September 1940 Germany began its first major air raid on London. The
					Blitz, as the bombing of the English capital became known, thrust civilians into
					the war and put relentless pressure on industry, ports, and British morale. With
					men joining the army, women were required to work in factories and on farms.
					Food rationing was introduced in Britain in January 1940, and people were urged
					to grow their own food. Nazi-occupied Europe also experienced food shortages,
					which weighed most heavily on the conquered populations.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1056"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000222.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Declarations of war</span> against Germany

					supported puppet administrations, such as the pro-Nazi Vidkun Quisling in Norway
					and the Vichy regime in southern France. Led by Marshal Philippe Pétain,
					Vichy was officially neutral, but it collaborated closely with Germany, fighting
					the French resistance, and implementing anti-Semitic legislation.</p><p class="calibre14">Germany had total control in Poland and eventual control of the Baltic states.
					Monarchs and politicians of more than a dozen occupied countries escaped to
					Britain. Polish ministers set up headquarters in London, and Belgium’s
					government operations were transferred there. The Dutch royal family, under
					Queen Wilhelmina, also sought refuge in London. When France fell to Germany,
					Charles de Gaulle, who opposed the newly installed Vichy government, became the
					voice of French opposition to the Nazi occupation.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1940 the biggest threat facing Britain was from German U-boats. As an
					island, Britain was dependent on its merchant ships to bring in vital supplies
					but also to export equipment to its fighting forces abroad, and German U-boats
					were sinking dozens of Allied ships each month. Merchant ships travelled in
					convoy to increase the chances of supplies getting through on each journey, but
					casualties were high.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1058"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"History knows no greater display of courage than that shown by the people

					Operation Barbarossa. Hitler had looked to the Soviet Union for new territory
					for the German people. It would also remove any future threat from the east but
					fundamentally followed through on Hitler’s plan to destroy communism. At
					first it looked as if Germany and its allies would be as successful against the
					Russians as it had been against the French. By winter, Germany had advanced to
					within 1.5km (1 mile) of Moscow, and Leningrad, the USSR’s second city,
					was under siege.</p><p class="calibre14">Another powerful rationale for war in the east was one based on racist
					ideology and Hitler’s hatred of Slavs and Jews. As German troops swept
					into Russia, they inflicted a terrible campaign of genocide against communists
					and Jews. Russian troops endured extreme hardships. German tanks ploughed
					through the Red Army defences. Prisoners of war were shot or left to starve.
					Fleeing civilians were butchered without a moment’s hesitation. The
					harshness of the Russian winter slowed the Germans, and Russian counterattacks
					drove back their front line by several hundred kilometres. In the Battle of
					Moscow, from early October 1941 to January 1942, an estimated 650,000 soldiers
					from the Soviet Army lost their lives. In the spring of 1942, the Germans
					resumed their offensive in the USSR, driving the Red Army back and coming close
					to taking the Russian oilfields.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1060"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000309.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Operation Barbarossa</span>, launched in June

					Harbor, in the Hawaiian Islands, as part of its plan to drive American forces
					out of the Pacific. Germany &ndash; which had a tripartite agreement with Japan
					and Italy to provide mutual military assistance in the event any one of them was
					attacked by a nation not already involved in the war &ndash; immediately
					declared war on the United States. Britain now had two strong allies, the USSR
					under Joseph Stalin, and the USA, led by President Franklin D Roosevelt. Both
					were decisive in bringing about the defeat of the Axis powers. American industry
					became a triumph of wartime production, giving Americans in combat in Europe and
					Asia the tools they needed to fight the Axis.</p><p class="calibre14">Japan won quick victories in the Pacific. It successfully captured the
					Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and Singapore, Britain’s main
					naval base in the Far East.</p><p class="calibre14">In North Africa, meanwhile, a renewed Axis offensive led by General Erwin
					Rommel brought the German and Italian armies within striking distance of Cairo
					and the Suez Canal. The first major Allied victory came in Egypt. In July 1942,
					Rommel was halted at El Alamein; in October, he was forced into retreat by the
					British 8th Army, led by Field Marshal Montgomery.</p><p class="calibre14">That same winter, the Red Army defeated the Nazis at Stalingrad. The Soviets

					invasion force arrived in Normandy in June 1944. Eleven months later, it had
					reached the river Elbe in northern Germany, while Russian troops were advancing
					block by block through Berlin. Germany was being hit repeatedly by British
					Lancaster bomber aircraft from Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force.
					Staring at defeat, Hitler committed suicide on 30 April, and Germany surrendered
					unconditionally a week later.</p><p class="calibre14">The last act of the war came in August 1945, when the USA, after fighting
					island by island through the Pacific, put an end to Japanese resistance by
					dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The effects of the bombs were

				met in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee to discuss the implementation of the
				“Final Solution of the Jewish Question” &ndash; the code name for the
				systematic annihilation of European Jews. During the conference, a tabulation of all
				the Jews in Europe was presented, country by country, as well as a target number for
				extermination: 11 million. The meeting lasted two hours and was matter-of-fact and
				dispassionate. After approving the “Final Solution” and the slaughter
				of the Jews, the men called for brandy and cigars.</p><p class="calibre14">The Wannsee Conference was far from the start of Nazi brutality against Jews.
				Adolf Hitler had come to power in 1933, spreading his belief that Germans were the
				Aryan master race, superior to all others, and that their blood should not be
				contaminated. He identified Jews as a race of people, not just a religious group.
				German Jews were banned from marrying non-Jewish Germans and subjected to increasing
				discrimination and segregation. From the time of the German takeover of Austria in
				1938, Nazi brutality against Jews worsened. Jews wanting to flee German rule found
				other countries unwilling to accept them.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1070"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000289.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-1071" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Gathering momentum</h2></div><p class="calibre15">After Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazi campaign against
					the Jews reached a terrifying new level. Herded into ghettoes, Polish Jews began
					to die in large numbers of starvation and ill-treatment.</p><p class="calibre14">When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, paramilitary death squads carried out
					mass killings of Jews in the conquered areas. To start with, victims were shot,
					up to 30,000 at a time, but the SS then began gassing Jews in the backs of vans.
					Poison gas was found to be a more efficient way to commit mass murder.</p><p class="calibre14">Until 1941, the Nazi leadership had envisaged solving the “Jewish
					problem” by deporting Jews to a distant location. By the time of the
					Wannsee Conference, however, they were committed to systematically killing
					Europe’s Jewish population. Six dedicated death camps were built in
					Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Nazi paramilitary corps, the SS, arranged the
					transport of Jews to the camps from right across Europe, including France,
					Greece, Hungary, and Italy. The Jews from the Polish ghettos were also taken
					there to be exterminated. Prisoners arrived at these huge killing factories by
					train and were gassed in shower rooms, their corpses burned in large crematoria.
					At the Belzec camp, about half a million Jews were killed, and only seven
					prisoners are known to have survived. The death camp at Auschwitz, however, also
					had a labour camp attached, where those who were not killed on arrival were made
					to work. The Germans needed slave labour to support their war effort, and this
					offered Jews their best chance of survival. Along with other prisoners &ndash;
					including socialists, homosexuals, Roma, and prisoners of war &ndash; many Jews
					were sent to concentration camps. Their heads were shaved, and they were given a
					uniform to strip them of their identity. When the Allies liberated the camps in
					1945, they found a vision of hell. The survivors were skeletal and
					traumatized.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1072"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000147.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Auschwitz, in southern Poland</span>, has become a

					every Eastern European country and created a block of satellite states
					subservient to Soviet leadership. The Western powers sought to create
					democracies that excluded communists from power. Germany remained divided into
					communist East and democratic West, an emblem of polarized Europe. In 1946,
					former British prime minister Winston Churchill summed up the situation when he
					stated that “an iron curtain has descended across the continent”.
					This deep division between East and West became known as the Cold War, since it
					never escalated into direct military conflict. The struggle over the future of

				British Empire, but on the last stroke of midnight on 14 August 1947, it became an
				independent nation. In India’s Constituent Assembly, Delhi, a special
				midnight gathering of parliament was convened. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime
				minister of India, rose to his feet to declare India’s freedom. However, this
				independence also opened a social and geographic wound that has yet to heal.</p><p class="calibre14">The new Indian state was split into two independent nation states: Muslim-majority
				Pakistan and Hindu-majority India. Pakistan itself was split between northwest and
				northeast, because both wings had a Muslim majority. Immediately, millions of
				Muslims trekked to West and East Pakistan (the latter now known as Bangladesh),
				while millions of Hindus and Sikhs headed towards the newly independent India.
				Thousands never reached it, and many died from malnutrition and disease. Across
				India there were outbreaks of sectarian violence, with Hindus and Sikhs on one side
				and Muslims on the other.</p><p class="calibre14">By 1948, as the great migration drew to a close, more than 15 million people had
				been uprooted, and between 1 million and 2 million were dead. India was independent
				and India’s Muslims had their own independent state, but freedom came at a
				great cost.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1085"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000224.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-1086" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The road to independence</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The spirit of nationalism in India gained ground in the mid-19th century and
					was strengthened in 1885 by the formation of the Indian National Congress (INC).
					During World War I, expectations for greater self-governance were raised when
					Britain promised to deliver self-rule in return for India’s contribution
					to the war effort. But Britain envisaged a gradual progress towards
					self-government, beginning with the Government of India Act (1919), which
					created an Indian parliament where power was shared between Indians and British
					officials. This did not satisfy Indian nationalists, and the British responded
					to their protests with sometimes brutal repression.</p><p class="calibre14">The push for independence from the 1920s to the 1940s was galvanized by the
					work of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi not only launched the Satyagraha
					campaign, promoting non-violent protest, but also became an influential figure
					for millions of followers. In 1942 Gandhi led the “Quit India”
					campaign, calling for civil disobedience to disrupt Britain’s efforts in
					World War II. The British immediately jailed Gandhi and other nationalist
					leaders.</p><p class="calibre14">By the end of World War II, it was clear that Britain lacked the means to
					defeat the nationalist campaign. Britain’s officials in India were
					utterly exhausted, and Britain itself was almost bankrupt. Britain agreed to a
					fully independent India. While Gandhi and Nehru advocated Indian unity, the
					Muslim League, founded in 1906 to safeguard the rights of Muslims, demanded a
					completely separate Muslim state. Its leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, feared that
					Muslims could not protect their minority rights if left to live under Hindu
					rule. Congress rejected the proposal and violence on the streets between Hindus
					and Muslims began to escalate.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1087"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Ours is not a drive for power, but purely a non-violent fight for

					Viceroy of India. Faced with irreconcilable differences over the demand for a
					separate state for India’s Muslims, he persuaded all parties to agree to
					partitioning the country into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.</p><p class="calibre14">From its birth, Pakistan faced many challenges. It had limited resources and a
					huge refugee problem. There were different traditions, cultures, and languages,
					and Jinnah, its first governor general, died the following year. In 1948, India
					and Pakistan fought over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority area to remain within
					India.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1089"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000363.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">India’s independence</span> was finally

					France, the Netherlands, and Portugal &ndash; recognized that change was
					inevitable. Some colonies won independence by peaceful means, such as in Burma
					and Ceylon (1948), but often, European powers tried to hold on to their
					colonies.</p><p class="calibre14">During World War II, Japan, itself a significant imperial power, drove the
					European powers out of Asia. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, nationalist
					movements in the former Asian colonies campaigned for independence rather than a
					return to European colonial rule. Dr Ahmed Sukarno, leader of Indonesia’s
					nationalist movement, declared the Independent Republic of Indonesia in 1945.
					The Dutch sent troops to restore their authority, and in two military campaigns
					that followed, an estimated 150,000 Indonesians and 5,000 Dutch soldiers died.
					International pressure eventually forced the Dutch to concede independence in
					1949.</p><p class="calibre14">The Japanese occupation of Malaya during the war had unified the Malayan
					people and greatly increased nationalistic feelings. Britain clamped down on
					protests, which led the militant wing of the Malaysian Communist Party to
					declare war on the British Empire in 1948. Britain responded by declaring a
					state of emergency and pursuing a bitter campaign against Chinese
					“communist terrorists”. Independence was not granted to Malaya
					until 1957.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1091" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Unrest in Africa</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In Kenya, the imposition of a state of emergency in 1952, in response to the
					Mau Mau (rebel) uprising, led to greater insurgency and the British rounding up
					of tens of thousands of Mau Mau suspects into detention camps. By 1956 the
					rebellion had been crushed, but the methods used by the British to regain
					control brought international condemnation. In central Africa, too,
					decolonization was born in violence. In Rhodesia, savage conflict erupted
					between the black majority and the fiercely racist white leadership, which had
					unilaterally declared independence in 1965.</p><p class="calibre14">The process of decolonization coincided with the new Cold War between the
					Soviet Union and the United States. The US became concerned that, as the
					European powers lost their colonies, Soviet-supported communist parties might
					achieve power in the new states. The US used substantial aid packages to
					encourage newly independent nations to adopt governments that aligned with the
					West. The Soviet Union deployed similar tactics in an effort to encourage new
					nations to join the communist bloc. Many resisted the pressure to be drawn into
					the Cold War and joined the “non-aligned movement”. This movement
					began out of a 1955 meeting in Bandung, Indonesia, involving 29 African and
					Asian countries. Member countries decided they would not be involved in
					alliances or defence pacts with the main world powers, but focus on internal
					development instead.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1092"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the

					independence was not realized after World War II, war broke out between Algerian
					nationalists and French settlers. In 1958 the National Liberation Front (FLN),
					the main nationalist group, led several terrorist attacks, first in Algeria,
					then in Paris. The crisis led to the return to power of Charles de Gaulle, the
					wartime leader of the Free French. In 1960, de Gaulle, to the horror of the
					French settlers, agreed to emancipate Algeria. After a long and bloody conflict
					in which an estimated 150,000 died, Algeria gained its independence in
					1962.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1094" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Independence gained</h2></div><p class="calibre15">During the 1960s and 70s, many of the countries that were once held as British
					colonies became independent states and joined the Commonwealth. The British
					Commonwealth, formed in 1931, became the successor to Britain’s old
					empire, preserving Britain’s global economic and political influence. In
					1931, Britain extended dominion status to the already self-governing colonies of
					Canada (1867), Australia (1901), New Zealand (1907), and Newfoundland (1907).
					Britain and her dominions shared equal status, and they accepted the British
					monarch as head of the Commonwealth. In 1949, the British Commonwealth became
					“The Commonwealth”, a free and equal association of independent
					states, but the end of the empire was drawing near. Britain fought a war to
					retain the Falkland Islands in 1982, and Hong Kong continued as a British
					dependency until 1997.</p><p class="calibre14">Gandhi had a profound influence on world politics. Other peaceful resisters
					&ndash; such as Martin Luther King Jr and Tibet’s Dalai Lama &ndash;
					emulated his methods. Around the world, the struggle for countries to secede
					from nations they belong to continues, as the likes of Scotland (United

					living there.</p><p class="calibre11">Gandhi’s involvement in Indian politics began in 1919, and he soon
					became the unquestioned leader of the independence movement. He preached the
					doctrine of Satyagraha (soul force, or passive resistance) which he applied
					against the British with great effect. He adopted a simple life believing in the
					virtue of small communities and campaigned against Indian
					industrialization.</p><p class="calibre11">Gandhi’s life work was crowned in 1947, when India finally won
					independence, but the concessions he had made to the Muslims led to his
					assassination the following year by a Hindu fanatic, who blamed him for the

				West Africa, had been demanding independence for several years, a group of unarmed
				African ex-servicemen marched to the British governor with a petition of grievances.
				Ordered to stop, they refused, and the police opened fire.</p><p class="calibre14">In response to this, in 1949, nationalist Kwame Nkrumah formed the Convention
				People’s Party (CPP), an organization fighting for self-governance. Nkrumah
				initiated a campaign of positive action inspired by Gandhi’s philosophy of
				non-violent non-cooperation in India against the British. The strikes and protests
				they encouraged remained peaceful but paralyzed the country, and Britain agreed to
				elections in early 1951. The CPP won 35 out of 38 seats, and the Gold Coast moved
				rapidly towards independence, which was proclaimed on 6 March 1957 with Nkrumah
				becoming prime minister of the nation of Ghana. It was a moment of huge hope for a
				new kind of Africa.</p><p class="calibre14">The European powers that ruled Africa had been impoverished by World War II, and

					Uganda.</p><p class="calibre14">The French fought an eight-year war to hold on to Algeria, finally conceding
					independence in 1962.</p><p class="calibre14">The Portuguese, the first European colonial power in Africa, fought a long war
					to hold on to their colonies of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea from 1961 to
					1974. The collapse of Belgian authority in the Congo in 1960 led to a wave of
					violence across the nation and the assassination of the first prime minister,
					Patrick Lumumba, in 1961.</p><p class="calibre14">Many African countries gained independence during the Cold War. Used as pawns
					between the capitalist and communist superpowers, they accepted loans and
					military aid: in the 1970s, Ethiopia was rewarded with billions of

				them. Each threatened nuclear war.</p><p class="calibre14">This was no empty threat: from the 1950s, both superpowers had begun stockpiling
				vast nuclear arsenals. Strategists articulated the mutually assured destruction
				(MAD) doctrine, which held that if Russia attacked the West, the West would make
				sure that they retaliate. In short, there would be no winners.</p><p class="calibre14">When Kennedy became president in 1961, he inherited a deteriorating relationship
				with Cuba. The US and Cuba had a history of mutual cooperation, but this had changed

					In response, the US imposed a sweeping trade embargo, so Castro turned to the
					Soviet Union for support. Fearing communist expansion, the US tried to topple
					Cuba’s government with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961,
					involving CIA-backed Cuban exiles.</p><p class="calibre14">Also in 1961, the US deployed 15 nuclear-tipped Jupiter missiles in Turkey, in
					readiness to strike against the USSR should the need arise. Turkey shared a

					This, and the desire to defend his Cuban ally from American aggression, led him
					to install missiles in Cuba that were capable of carrying nuclear warheads. On
					14 October 1962, photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane showed nuclear weapon
					sites being built by the Soviets. Kennedy’s military advisers sought an
					immediate attack on the missile sites, but Kennedy favoured a naval blockade of
					Cuba to prevent the installation of more missiles. He issued an ultimatum to
					Khrushchev to withdraw and informed the world that nuclear war was an imminent
					possibility. Meanwhile, Khrushchev ordered the captains of Soviet ships to hold
					their course for Cuban ports.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1129"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000296.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Cuban president Fidel Castro</span> and Soviet

					would also abort its plan to invade Cuba.</p><p class="calibre14">On 28 October, Khrushchev ordered his ships to turn around &ndash; a defining

				second attack has since been disputed, but US president Lyndon B Johnson,
				recognizing that South Vietnam could not prevail on its own against a communist-led

				and intellectuals into proletarians &ndash; ordinary workers. He ordered the
				Cultural Revolution, which would attack the “Four Olds”: old ideas,
				old habits, old customs, and old culture. Squads of young communists, incited by Mao
				and known as the Red Guards, terrorized intellectuals, bureaucrats, and teachers.
				Some 36 million people were persecuted, and up to a million died in the turmoil,

					reforms to transform China’s semi-feudal, mostly agricultural society
					into an industrialized socialist state. In the late 1950s, in a bid to achieve
					rapid economic growth, Mao ordered the Great Leap Forward. Industrial output
					climbed with steel and coal production, the rail network doubled, and more than
					half of all Chinese land was irrigated by 1961.</p><p class="calibre14">However, this development came at a terrible cost. Mao transformed rural China
					into a series of farming communes in which villagers pooled land, animals,
					tools, and crops. The authorities took vast amounts of grain from the communes
					to feed city workers, and this, along with a series of natural disasters, led to
					famine and starvation. The consequences were staggering: an estimated 45 million
					people died.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1161"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000372.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">In this propaganda poster</span> dating from

					Richard Nixon travelled to Peking to meet with Mao. By the time Mao died in
					1976, China had become a major oil producer with nuclear capabilities.</p><p class="calibre14">Deng Xiaoping, who led China from 1978 to 1997, was willing to use capitalist
					ideas to focus on economic growth. But while he initiated new and far-reaching
					measures, such as inviting foreign firms to invest in Chinese industry and
					supporting developing technologies, he also resisted pressure to make democratic
					reforms.</p><p class="calibre14">By the beginning of the new millennium, China’s economic growth was
					spectacular. In 2001, the country was admitted to the World Trade Organization,
					and in 2008 it played host to the Olympic Games in Beijing. Some economists
					predict that by 2026 China will boast a gross domestic product (GDP) greater
					than Japan and Western Europe.</p><p class="calibre14">After Mao’s death, the Chinese Communist Party condemned the Cultural
					Revolution as a disaster. However, as the country experienced a period of
					unparalleled economic growth, a sense of nostalgia for Mao’s ideals,
					focused on the people and self-sufficiency, grew among farmers and members of
					the urban working class. Today, Mao’s legacy continues to cast a long

					the leader of Communist China from 1949 until his death in 1976. While working
					as a librarian at Peking University, he became a communist and helped found the
					Communist Party in 1921. Six years later, after leading an unsuccessful
					rebellion against nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, Mao was forced to retreat
					to the countryside, where he proclaimed the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931. He
					took control of the Communist Party in 1935, after proving his leadership during

					1945&ndash;49.</p><p class="calibre11">A devoted Leninist, Mao became disenchanted with the Soviet policy of
					“peaceful coexistence” towards the West and developed Maoism, a
					stronger form of communism. However, his radical ideas and experiments with
					collectivization led to the death and suffering of millions. One of his last

				pass. For Egyptians, the nationalization symbolized the liberation of their country
				from the British imperialist dominance it had been under since the 1880s. In
				response to Nasser’s bold move, a secret plan was hatched by Britain, France,
				and Israel. France was eager for Nasser’s downfall because of his support for
				Algerian insurgents against French colonial rule in Algeria. Israel had many reasons
				for toppling Nasser, including Egypt’s denial of passage through the canal to
				any Israeli-flagged ships. The three conspired that Israel would attack Egypt, and
				Britain and France would intervene a few days later posing as peacemakers, taking
				control of the canal. On 29 October 1956, the Israelis began their assault. British
				and French troops invaded on 31 October but faced immediate diplomatic pressure to
				call a ceasefire. The United States, which was trying to cultivate good relations
				with Arab states, was appalled by the Anglo-French invasion, believing it threatened
				the stability of the whole region. President Dwight Eisenhower forced through a
				United Nations resolution imposing a ceasefire, and British and French troops had to
				conduct a humiliating withdrawal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1167"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000302.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">President Nasser</span> of Egypt announces the

					years, fuelled by the West’s increased involvement in the region.
					Colonialism in the 1800s and the division of the Ottoman Empire after World War
					I were bitter humiliations for peoples who felt their religion, Islam, was the
					highest form of divine revelation. In 1948, the partition of Palestine to form
					Israel spilt the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and was rejected
					vehemently by Israeli Arabs and enraged the other Arab nations. The regular
					armies of the Arab states &ndash; including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan,
					Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt &ndash; attacked Israel in the first
					Arab&ndash;Israeli War in May and June 1948. The war ended in defeat for the
					Arabs and disaster for the Palestinians: more than half of the country’s
					Arabs were uprooted as refugees, and they lost any possibility of a state of
					their own.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1169"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000272.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-1170" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">Ambitious plans</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Egypt continued its stance of belligerence towards Israel by closing the Suez
					Canal to Israeli shipping. When Nasser ousted the regime of King Farouk in 1954
					and sent him into exile, he imported arms from the Soviet Union to build his
					arsenal for future confrontations with Israel. Britain had agreed to withdraw
					its troops from the Suez area by June 1956, but as the last troops left Egypt,
					Nasser relied on funds from Britain and the USA to finance ambitious plans to
					develop Egypt. This included the Aswan Dam project on the Nile. Nasser was
					angered when Britain and the United States withdrew its offer of loans to help
					him pay for the dam. The US and Britain backed out because of Nasser’s
					association with the Soviets and his unceasing diatribes against the West.
					Nasser felt insulted and immediately nationalized the Suez Canal. The move was
					popular in Egypt, as the canal was a source of Arab pride.</p><p class="calibre14">Nasser was a secular modernizer who advocated the separation of religion from
					political life, believing it the hallmark of Arab modernity, but this was not
					universally welcomed. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, argued
					for Islam to have a central role in government. After repeated calls for the
					application of Sharia law &ndash; a legal system based on Islam &ndash; and an
					assassination attempt against Nasser, the organization was finally banned in
					1954.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1967, Arab countries suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Israel in
					the Six Day War, in which Israel took the Sinai from Egypt, the Golan Heights
					from Syria, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, meaning Israel was
					now an occupier. In the 1970s and 80s, the Arab&ndash;Israeli conflict largely
					moved in the direction of peace: in 1979 the Israeli&ndash;Egypt peace deal
					ended 30 years of war. The rise of the Palestine Liberation Army and of other
					Palestinian groups attacking Israel, however, as well as Israel’s
					invasion of Lebanon in 1982, where many of these groups were based, continuously
					destabilized the fragile peace.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1171"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000088.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">US president Jimmy Carter</span> (centre)

					ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I. Iraq was a land
					divided along ethnic lines between Arabs and Kurds, as well as sectarian lines
					between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the latter being the majority group. Saddam
					Hussein, a Sunni, became leader in 1979, and suppressed ethnic Kurds and Shias
					alike using immense brutality. He, like Nasser in Egypt, espoused Arab
					nationalism and ruled Iraq as a secular state.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1979, events in Iran inspired Islamists throughout the Middle East. The
					secular, Western way of life was swept away in an Islamic revolution in which
					the US-backed Shah was ousted. The new regime, under Ayatollah Khomeini, a Shia
					Muslim, based its laws and ideology on the strict teachings of the Koran. Saddam
					felt threatened by the Islamic revolution and a possible Shia uprising in his
					own country, so he invaded Iran on 22 September 1980 under the pretext of a
					territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab, a waterway that lies between the two
					countries.</p><p class="calibre14">The invasion triggered a bruising eight-year war that devastated both
					countries and increased tensions in the Middle East. Iran’s principal
					ally was Syria, but Libya, China, and North Korea all also sent weapons.
					Iraq’s support came mostly from the Arab Gulf states, which viewed Iran
					as the greater danger to their security; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait provided
					billions of dollars in loans. Ultimately, Iran was defeated; and Iraq, now awash
					with armaments supplied by several Western nations, including Britain, France,
					and the United States, invaded the oil-rich state of Kuwait in 1990. The UN
					demanded their withdrawal, but Saddam announced that Kuwait had been annexed by
					Iraq. The United States, with support from coalition forces, sent in troops
					during the First Gulf War (1990&ndash;91) and toppled Saddam from power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1173"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000211.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">During the First Gulf War</span>, Iraqi forces

					that was wrong with the West, and terrorist strikes on US targets grew. Al-Qaeda
					carried out the most shocking on 11 September 2001, against four targets in the
					United States, including the World Trade Center in New York City.</p><p class="calibre14">In response to the 9/11 attacks, a successful US-led international
					intervention brought down the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the US
					believed had given sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. After 11
					September, President Bush declared a “War on Terror” and, in 2002,
					with help from the British government, attacked Iraq on the premise of
					destroying “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs) deemed a threat to

					&ndash; looking inward to promote change and blaming their own leaders for
					decades of political, economic, and cultural decline &ndash; were at the heart
					of uprisings across the Arab world. At its core, what became known as the Arab
					Spring was a new generation’s attempt to change the state order. An
					extraordinary series of pro-democracy uprisings, the Arab Spring caused huge
					upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. It started in Tunisia on 17
					December 2010 when a street vendor set himself on fire in a protest against
					police brutality. Protestors throughout Tunisia demanded democracy, and
					President Zine el Abidine fled the country on 14 January. Disorder spread from

					Soviet leadership, ruthlessly suppressing any opposition. In the autumn of 1956,
					Hungary rose against its communist government, only to be crushed by Soviet
					tanks, and in 1968, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to remove a government it
					found too liberal.</p><p class="calibre14">In the 1960s, Germany was still divided between East and West, and its former
					capital Berlin split into the Allied-operated West and the Soviet-controlled
					East. Each had its own German administration: democratic in the West, communist
					in the East. Thousands of East Germans escaped to the West, and the country
					haemorrhaged its skilled workers. On 13 August 1961, the government sealed off

					barrier dividing the city, the nation, and family and friends.</p><p class="calibre14">In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev was appointed as General Secretary of the Soviet

					the US Defense Department to consider means of communication after a nuclear
					attack. This led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects
					Agency Network) in 1969, a system initially of four computers. In the mid-1980s,
					this growing network of interconnected computers became known as the Internet.
					Both the Internet and the World Wide Web were limited to academic and research
					organizations.</p><p class="calibre14">It wasn’t until the 1993 launch of a user-friendly Web browser called
					Mosaic that the Web took off for more general use. Mosaic could show pictures as
					well as text, and users could follow Web links simply by clicking on them with a
					mouse. The Web became synonymous with the Internet, but they are distinct from
					one another. The World Wide Web facilitated navigation of the Internet and
					helped make the Internet such an effective mode of communication.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1204"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000382.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</span>, creator of the World

					revolution in home and office computing. Smaller and cheaper than the large
					office computers, it and its successors had access to the Internet and email.
					With personal computers, the Internet saw huge growth. The first search engines
					began to appear in the early 1990s; Google, which is now almost synonymous with
					Web searches, arrived a little later, in 1997. The launch of online marketplace
					Amazon in 1994 revolutionized the way people shopped, allowing the purchase of
					everything from books and CDs to hotel rooms and airline tickets from the
					comfort of home.</p><p class="calibre14">The Internet brought about significant changes to the way businesses operated;
					globalization escalated, and the world seemed to become a much smaller place,
					with communication improved by the speed and efficiency of the Internet. Jobs
					were outsourced, and companies effectively became “nationless”,
					since it was easier to operate from anywhere in the world.</p><p class="calibre14">The next wave of technological advances saw devices become smaller and more
					mobile due to electronic components on tiny integrated circuits, or
					“chips”.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1206" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The future is now</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Nowhere has the introduction of microchip technology had more impact than the
					introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007. So-called smartphones have made the
					Internet a mobile resource, with wireless connectivity offering on-the-go access
					to news and satellite navigation, for example. Information and ideas can be
					shared from anywhere at the touch of a button via social-networking sites such
					as Facebook and Twitter. Smartphones have also had an impact on education,
					healthcare, and culture, and have changed the political landscape through use by
					protestors organizing rallies via social media to undermine regimes. Uprisings
					such as the Arab Spring, which began in 2010, were partly powered by activists
					who communicated across the Internet. Internet activism, or
					“clicktivism”, has since become a powerful way to share ideas,
					raise awareness, or support a cause. With more than 3 billion users, the World
					Wide Web has transformed every aspect of modern daily life.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1207"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"The information highway will transform our culture as dramatically as

				recession. Low interest rates and unregulated credit had induced more and more
				people to get into unsustainable debts. Bankers, particularly in the US, offered
				mortgages to customers with a poor credit history. These mortgages were called
				“subprime mortgages”. It was hoped that if people could not keep up
				with their mortgage payments, their houses could be repossessed and sold at a
				profit, but this depended on house prices rising. In 2007, interest rates crept up,
				and house prices fell. People began defaulting on their monthly repayments. Across
				the US, houses were repossessed at a great loss, with bankers fearing they would not
				get their money back.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1210"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000335.png" class="calibre9" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-1211" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The crisis spreads to Europe</h2></div><p class="calibre15">In August 2007, the French bank Paribas revealed that it was at risk from the
					subprime mortgage market. Bankers had gambled with trillions of dollars of
					investment on risky mortgages that might now be worthless. Panic set in, and
					banks stopped lending to one another. British bank Northern Rock faced a
					shortage of readily available cash, and was forced to ask the British government
					for an emergency loan.</p><p class="calibre14">Around the world, shares began to plummet. In September 2008, US mortgage
					lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were rescued by the American government,
					while Lehman Brothers, a powerful investment bank heavily involved in the
					subprime mortgages market, was forced to file for bankruptcy. The US government
					considered Lehman Brothers too insolvent and did not bail it out.</p><p class="calibre14">The turmoil in financial markets led to a severe economic downturn in most
					Western economies. Share prices plummeted, and world trade decreased because
					governments spent less. Ireland became the first European country to fall into
					recession, a period of economic decline. Iceland’s government resigned in
					October 2008 after the country became almost bankrupt. Some governments &ndash;
					such as those in the USA, China, Brazil, and Argentina &ndash; planned stimulus
					packages to boost their economies. They increased government spending and
					decreased taxes. Others, especially in Europe, opted for austerity, freezing
					public spending, and increasing taxes. Protests and strikes swept through Europe
					in response to these measures. Portugal, Spain, and Greece came under pressure
					from the European Union (EU) to lower their debts. The EU spent billions
					propping up weak economies in an attempt to keep the Eurozone, and the euro,
					viable. But the effect of the economic crisis was devastating, and many people
					lost their homes and jobs. It was the worst economic downturn since World War
					II.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1212"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000308.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Lehman Brothers</span>, an investment bank

					devastated by war, needed time to recover. The USA, which had experienced a huge
					rise in manufacturing for the war effort and was spared destruction, continued
					manufacturing at higher levels than ever before and dominated the world economy.
					The post-war economic planners sought a new economic order based on industrial
					strength and a stable dollar. In 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was
					formed to foster the revival of global trade. The US’s strong post-war
					economy and the Marshall Plan of 1947, a US-led initiative to aid Western
					countries, invigorated world trade through encouraging capitalism and the free
					exchange of goods between nations. Signed in 1947, the General Agreement on
					Tariffs and Trade (GATT) dictated that tariffs be removed to open up markets
					around the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1214"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000262.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The oil crisis</span> that struck Western

					implemented reforms based on efficiency and restricted foreign imports. They did
					not sign up to the GATT agreement until 1955. Japan invested in its coal and
					steel industries, as well as shipbuilding and car manufacturing. In the 1960s,
					Japan specialized in high-tech products such as cameras and computer chips.
					Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia experienced
					similar growth with an emphasis on electronics and technology. These successes
					became collectively known as “Asian tiger economics”.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1216" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">The role of oil</h2></div><p class="calibre15">By the 1970s, the world was divided between rich industrial countries and poor
					developing nations, and oil had become increasingly important. In 1960, the
					Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), including Saudi
					Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran, was founded. As oil reserves in other countries
					dwindled, the states around the Persian Gulf, where this resource had remained
					plentiful, became dominant. In October 1973, when Egypt and Syria invaded Israel
					during the Yom Kippur War, OAPEC embargoed oil to any country helping Israel,
					and prices trebled. Without oil, industrial output dropped. The United States
					introduced strict fuel rationing, which ended in March 1974, when the oil
					embargo was lifted.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1217" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">A new economic model</h2></div><p class="calibre15">The oil crisis in the mid-1970s led to a deep global recession, soaring
					inflation, and high unemployment. In response, a new “neo-liberal”
					economic policy was adopted, transferring control of economic factors from the
					public to the private sector. Welfare programmes were perceived to be one cause
					of economic failures, and there were drastic cutbacks. Deregulation became the
					driving force behind world economics, sweeping away many governmental controls
					and freeing up organizations to trade across a wider range of territories. The
					need for this was particularly felt in the United States, which faced stiff
					competition from a world now fully rebuilt from the destruction of World War II.
					Some of the rigid laws and regulations that had been put in place to protect
					consumers were now considered to be interfering with free enterprise.</p><p class="calibre14">The global push for deregulation resulted in the adoption of new markets,
					greater competition, and openness, especially as the world adapted to the end of
					the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The example set in east Asia
					influenced policy makers in other Asian countries, such as India and China.
					Mexico and Brazil lowered their barriers to trade and embarked on economic
					reform, leading to a dramatic improvement in living standards. As East and West
					Germany reunited in 1989, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the European Union
					(EU), an economic union of 28 European countries, emerged as a major force in
					the world economy. Also in the 1980s, China opened up to foreign trade, and huge
					sums of foreign investment poured in, leading to extraordinary growth.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1218"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global

					goods in one part of the world and have them delivered elsewhere within a matter
					of days. World trade is made up of global partnerships, with multinational
					companies that boast huge turnovers. Across the globe, people tend to migrate to
					cities to find work, resulting in an increase in urbanization.</p><p class="calibre14">One complaint that is often aimed at globalization is that some companies
					exploit cheap labour and behave unethically in their bid for profit. Another is
					that globalization has contributed to the extraordinary accumulation of wealth
					by a few individuals and, thus, increased inequality. Some countries have also
					remained extremely poor &ndash; areas of sub-Saharan Africa, for example have
					fared badly and been left behind, in debt to wealthier nations.</p><p class="calibre14">Economic recessions have occurred throughout history, but the financial crisis
					of 2008&ndash;11 was the worst &ndash; at least since the Great Depression of
					1929 &ndash; and maybe the worst ever. Many felt it was an avoidable disaster
					caused by widespread failures in government regulation and heedless risk-taking
					by investment bankers. Only massive monetary and fiscal stimuli prevented
					catastrophe. Household and business debts remained high, and there was
					widespread fury directed at bankers, whom many felt had survived relatively
					unscathed. Austerity measures provoked civil unrest. Demonstrations were held
					against capitalism; the Occupy Movement spread, with tens of thousands marching
					in New York, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Rome, Sydney, and Hong Kong. While
					financiers argued over the causes of the Global Recession, the impact on the
					lives of ordinary people had profound, lasting consequences.</p></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-1220"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">An era of protest</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-1221"><span><img alt="" src="images/000131.jpg" class="calibre22" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">People took to the streets</span> to protest

					financial heart of London in 2009, they were faced with thousands of angry
					protestors. Social media became critical in the organization of large gatherings
					and the occupation of physical spaces. As protests spread throughout Europe,
					they used the banner of “Occupy”, a movement set up in New York to
					protest against social and economic inequality. There were riots in Rome,
					strikes in Greece, demonstrations in Portugal, and occupations in the public
					squares of Barcelona, Moscow, Madrid, New York, Chicago, and Istanbul.</p></div><div class="calibre20"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre21"><b class="calibre13">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-96" class="calibre3">The Wall Street Crash</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-90" class="calibre3">The 1968 protests</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="calibre3">The launch of the first website</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-60" class="calibre3">Global population exceeds 7 billion</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div></div></div>

				farming technology expanded the food supply and lowered the risk of famine. The
				marked increase of industrialization and advances in medicine improved public health
				and living standards.</p><p class="calibre14">By 1927, the world population figure had reached 2 billion. In the early 20th
				century, population growth was highest in the rich industrialized West, but this
				pattern began to change. Mid-century saw many European countries experience falling
				birth rates, while population growth increased sharply in the relatively
				underdeveloped areas of Asia, Africa, and South America due to a much higher birth
				rate. In 1987, the 5 billionth person was born; and by 1999, the 6 billionth. It
				took 123 years for the world’s population to go from 1 billion to 2 billion,

					food that they were unable to grow themselves, to enable them to meet the
					demands of a growing population. Britain, for example, imported 55 million tons
					of food each year.</p><p class="calibre14">In the early 1940s, Mexico imported half of its wheat, and its population was
					rapidly expanding. The country requested technical expertise from the United
					States on ways to increase wheat production. By 1944, with the financial support
					of the American Rockefeller Foundation, a group of US scientists, including
					American biochemist Norman Borlaug, had begun researching methods of developing
					a high-yielding strain of wheat that could resist disease and was short in
					height, so as to reduce wind damage. The work in Mexico was incredibly
					successful: by 1956, the country was totally self-sufficient and no longer
					imported wheat and maize. This success launched what became known as the Green
					Revolution &ndash; the spread of new modern agricultural technologies in the
					1960s and 70s that dramatically increased food production around the world. The
					Green Revolution benefited countries that included the Philippines, Bangladesh,
					Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, Kenya, Iran, Thailand, and Turkey.</p><p class="calibre14">Indian scientists in particular had followed the work of Borlaug and his
					colleagues. In the mid-1960s, India had been struck by two back-to-back
					droughts, which led to the need for large food imports from the United States.
					In 1964, both India and Pakistan began importing and testing semi-dwarf
					varieties of wheat from Mexico, and the results were promising: in the spring of
					1966, the harvest was larger than any ever produced in South Asia, despite it
					being a dry year.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1226"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000203.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">Dr Norman Borlaug</span> shows off his wheat,

					International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. With its much reduced
					growing cycle, this new product brought about a dramatic transformation in
					farmers’ lives. In countries such as Vietnam, two complete crops of the
					new rice could now be produced each year, whereas the traditional rice it
					replaced would only produce one crop. Stunning innovations such as this in
					agricultural science allowed chronically poor countries, in Asia in particular,
					to feed themselves and meet the demands of their growing populations.</p><p class="calibre14">The Green Revolution did not come without controversy, not least because it
					involved a move towards chemical pesticides. During the 1940s, the insecticide
					DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was introduced as a way of controlling a
					variety of diseases, including mosquito-borne malaria, with a single treatment.
					However in 1962, American biologist Rachel Carson highlighted the dangers of DDT
					in her groundbreaking book <i class="calibre5">Silent Spring</i>,
					claiming that it may cause cancer and also be bad for the environment. <i class="calibre5">Silent Spring</i> led to a nationwide ban on DDT in the
					USA and raised enough concern to trigger the establishment of the Environmental
					Protection Agency (EPA), an independent body to safeguard the environment. The
					Green Revolution also faced huge challenges in many countries in Africa, where
					there was a lack of irrigation facilities, unreliable rainfall, high fertilizer
					prices, and no credit to buy new seed varieties.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-1228" class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><h2 class="heading_h">GM crops</h2></div><p class="calibre15">Genetically modified (GM) crops were greeted with excitement in the 1990s and
					regarded as part of the Second Green Revolution, but this, too, proved
					controversial. GM crops are foods produced from organisms that have had changes
					added into their DNA via genetic engineering. They were introduced in the US in
					1994 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Flavr Savr
					tomato for sale. The delayed-ripening tomato had a longer shelf-life than
					conventional tomatoes, but trials using potatoes suggested that GM produce was
					toxic to rats. Most European Union (EU) governments banned the use of GM crops,
					while supporters of GM suggested that without genetic intervention, the world
					was destined to starve. Advocates of GM &ndash; notably the USA, Brazil,
					Canada, Argentina, and Australia &ndash; believe it has the potential to combat
					disease and hunger. The feeling in Europe, Africa, and Asia is more cautious,
					with concern about pesticides and possible harm to health.</p><p class="calibre14">Despite such opposition, GM technology is still being developed. It is thought
					that 670,000 children die from lack of vitamin A each year, a deficiency that
					causes diseases such as malaria and measles and leads to blindness. Advances in
					the tackling of such deficiencies include, for example, the creation of
					“golden rice”, in which vitamin A is added to ordinary
					rice.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1229"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000048.png" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">This graph</span> plots the high, medium, and

					ever-growing global population, cities have swallowed up large tracts of
					farmland and rural areas. At the beginning of the 21st century, China
					experienced an onslaught of urban development that meant the loss of a large
					number of the country’s tiny farms.</p><p class="calibre14">People have historically been drawn to cities for employment and social
					opportunities. In 1800, one in four British people lived in cities, but by 1900
					this had grown to three in four. Many moved from rural areas to the city, but
					people also moved from one country to another seeking refuge and a better life.
					The urban population in 2014 accounted for 54 per cent of the total global
					population, up from 34 per cent in 1960. In 2014, the UN predicted that
					two-thirds of the world will live in cities by 2050. However, lack of affordable
					accommodation is a key factor in homelessness: in sub-Saharan Africa, 70 per
					cent of city-dwellers live in slums. Poor health and violent crime is an issue
					in the world’s major cities, as is the huge disparity between rich and
					poor.</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1231"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"This is not a political issue. Or a cultural issue. It’s not about

					believe that human activity is to blame for climate change (or “global
					warming”). Since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, global
					temperatures have continued to rise, with 2011&ndash;15 the warmest five-year
					period on record.</p><p class="calibre14">Some of the reasons behind climate change are due to natural occurrences, but
					in the early 1970s the rise of environmentalism raised public doubts about the
					benefits to the planet of human activity. Developing nations were being urged to
					reduce carbon emissions, which are thought to affect climate change. In 2015,
					India was opening a mine a month to lift its 1.3 billion citizens out of poverty
					rapidly. Developed countries, which had themselves contributed to climate
					change, caused a new tension by suggesting that developing nations should cease
					exploiting their own natural resources to improve the economic wellbeing of
					their people. Scientists warned that humans would pass the threshold beyond
					which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible if greenhouse-gas
					emissions kept increasing. Sea levels are also rising, eroding coastal areas and
					obliterating small islands in the South Pacific. Rainfall patterns are changing,
					leading to severe drought in Africa, and many species of animals are in danger
					of extinction.</p><p class="calibre14">The threat of climate change is now considered so serious that leaders from
					around the world met in 2015 in Paris, France, at a conference to agree to
					reduce the build-up of greenhouse gases. In fraught negotiations, developing
					countries demanded that wealthier nations help pay for them to adapt to the
					effects of climate change, such as increased floods and droughts. In all, 196
					nations adopted the first ever universal, legally binding, global climate deal,
					limiting global warming to the relatively safe level of 2°C
					(3.6°F).</p><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-1233"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"We are not going to be able to burn it all."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Barack Obama <br class="calibre8" /><span class="calibre13">On fossil fuels</span></p></div></div></div><div class="calibre10"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-1234"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000331.jpg" class="calibre9" /></span><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre18"><span class="bold1">The severe air pollution</span> caused by

					from mass starvation by the mid-1980s. This dire prediction did not come to
					pass, but with an astonishing 7 billion humans on the planet, there is an
					inevitable drain on natural resources. Overfishing, particularly in Indonesia
					and China, has led to fish stocks around the world falling rapidly, and the
					demand for water could soon outstrip supply. In 2015, the UN predicted that 1.8
					billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water
					scarcity by 2025. Coal, which drives industry and production, is in increasing
					demand but will eventually run out.</p><p class="calibre14">The UN estimates that by 2050 the global population will be at 9.7 billion,
					and that by 2100, 11.2 billion people will inhabit the Earth. Population
					dynamics are changing from high mortality and high fertility to low mortality
					and low fertility, with an increasingly elderly population worldwide, which will
					be difficult to support. Challenges such as climate change, migration and
					refugee crises, food and water insecurity, poverty, debt, and disease are
					greatly exacerbated by rapid population growth. Stabilizing the growth of the

					average life expectancy worldwide, from birth, was 71.0 years. Health education,
					which focused on diet and basic hygiene, led to a reduction in infant mortality,
					and better sanitation and clean drinking water have reduced the risks of
					spreading infectious diseases, including cholera and typhoid.</p><p class="calibre11">One of the biggest contributory factors to longer life expectancy has been the
					eradication of some killer diseases. The antibiotic drug penicillin, which helps
					fight bacterial infection, became widely used to treat diseases such as
					tuberculosis and syphilis. Later, mass vaccination programmes by governments and
					the United Nations’ World Health Organization (WHO) helped eradicate
					smallpox and work towards the elimination of polio. Advances in medicine and
					diagnostics have revolutionized healthcare. Some scientists predict that by 2050
