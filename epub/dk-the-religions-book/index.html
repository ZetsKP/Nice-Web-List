			articulates all its dimensions. Encompassing spiritual, personal, and social elements,
			this phenomenon is however, ubiquitous, appearing in every culture from prehistory to
			the modern day&mdash;as evidenced in the cave paintings and elaborate burial customs of
			our distant ancestors and the continuing quest for a spiritual goal to life.</p><p class="calibre10">For Palaeolithic people&mdash;and indeed for much of human history&mdash;religion
			provided a way of understanding and influencing powerful natural phenomena. Weather and
			the seasons, creation, life, death and the afterlife, and the structure of the cosmos
			were all subject to religious explanations that invoked controlling gods, or a realm
			outside the visible inhabited by deities and mythical creatures. Religion provided a
			means to communicate with these gods, through ritual and prayer, and these
			practices&mdash;when shared by members of a community&mdash;helped to cement social
			groups, enforce hierarchies, and provide a deep sense of collective identity.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;As societies became more complex, their belief systems grew with them and religion was
			increasingly deployed as a political tool. Military conquests were often followed by the
			assimilation of the pantheon of the defeated people by the victors; and kingdoms and
			empires were often supported by their deities and priestly classes.</p><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h"></h2></div><div id="calibre_link-304" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A personal god</h2></div><p class="intro">Religion met many of the needs of early people and provided templates by which
					they could organize their lives&mdash;through rites, rituals, and taboos. It
					also gave them a means by which they could visualize their place in the cosmos.
					Could religion therefore be explained as a purely social artifact? Many would
					argue that it is much more. Over the centuries, people have defied opposition to
					their faiths, suffering persecution or death to defend their right to worship
					their God or gods. And even today, when the world is arguably more materialistic
					than ever before, more than three-quarters of its population consider
					themselves to hold some form of religious belief. Religion would seem to be a
					necessary part of human existence, as important to life as the ability to use
					language. Whether it is a matter of intense personal experience&mdash;an inner
					awareness of the divine&mdash;or a way of finding significance and meaning, and
					providing a starting point for all of life’s endeavors, it appears to be
					fundamental at a personal as well as a social level.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"All men have need of the gods."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Homer</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-305" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Beginnings</h2></div><p class="intro">We know about the religions of the earliest societies from the relics they
					left behind and from the stories of later civilizations. In addition, isolated
					tribes in remote places, such as the Amazonian forest in South America, the
					Indonesian islands, and parts of Africa, still practice religions that are
					thought to have remained largely unchanged for millennia. These primal religions
					often feature a belief in a unity between nature and the spirit, linking people
					inextricably with the environment.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the early religions evolved, their ceremonies and cosmologies became
					increasingly sophisticated. Primal religions of the nomadic and seminomadic
					peoples of prehistory gave way to the religions of the ancient and, in turn, of
					the classical civilizations. Their beliefs are now often dismissed as mythology,
					but many elements of these ancient narrative traditions persist in
					today’s faiths. Religions continued to adapt, old beliefs were absorbed
					into the religions of the society that succeeded them, and new faiths emerged
					with different observances and rituals.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-306"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00319.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-307" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Ancient to modern</h2></div><p class="intro">It is hard to pinpoint the time when many religions began, not least because
					their roots lie in prehistory and the sources that describe their origins may
					date from a much later time. However, it is thought that the oldest surviving
					religion today is Hinduism, which has its roots in the folk religions of the
					Indian subcontinent, brought together in the writing of the Vedas as early as
					the 13th century BCE. From this Vedic tradition came not only the pluralistic
					religion we now know as Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, and, later,
					Sikhism, which emerged in the 15th century.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, other belief systems were developing in the East. From the 17th
					century BCE, the Chinese dynasties established their nation states and empires.
					There emerged traditional folk religions and ancestor worship that were later
					incorporated into the more philosophical belief systems of Daoism and
					Confucianism.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eastern Mediterranean, ancient Egyptian and Babylonian religions were
					still being practiced when the emerging city-states of Greece and Rome developed
					their own mythologies and pantheons of gods. Further east, Zoroastrianism
					&mdash;the first major known monotheistic religion&mdash;had already been
					established in Persia, and Judaism had emerged as the first of the Abrahamic
					religions, followed by Christianity and Islam.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many religions recognized the particular significance of one or more
					individuals as founders of the faith: they may have been embodiments of god,
					such as Jesus or Krishna, or recipients of special divine revelation, such as
					Moses and Muhammad.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The religions of the modern world continued to evolve with advances in
					society, sometimes reluctantly, and often by dividing into branches. Some
					apparently new religions began to appear, especially in the 19th and 20th
					centuries, but these invariably bore the traces of the faiths that had come
					before.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"There is no use disguising the fact, our religious needs are the deepest.
						There is no peace until they are satisfied and contented."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Isaac Hecker, Roman Catholic priest</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Elements of religion</h2></div><p class="intro">Human history has seen the rise and fall of countless religions, each with its
					own distinct beliefs, rituals, and mythology. Although some are similar and
					considered to be branches of a larger tradition, there are many contrasting and
					contradictory belief systems.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some religions, for example, have a number of gods, while others, especially
					the more modern major faiths, are monotheistic; and there are major differences
					of opinion between religions on such matters as the afterlife. We can, however,
					identify certain elements common to almost all religions in order to examine the
					similarities and differences between them. These aspects&mdash;the ways in
					which the beliefs and practices of a religion are manifested&mdash;are what the
					British writer and philosopher of religion Ninian Smart called the
					“dimensions of religion.”</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most obvious elements we can use to identify and compare religions
					are the observances of a faith. These includes such activities as prayer,
					pilgrimage, meditation, feasting and fasting, dress, and of course ceremonies
					and rituals. Also evident are the physical aspects of a religion: the
					artifacts, relics, places of worship, and holy places. Less apparent is the
					subjective element of the religion&mdash;its mystical and emotional aspects,
					and how a believer experiences the religion in achieving ecstasy, enlightenment,
					or inner peace, for example, or establishing a personal relationship with the
					divine.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of most religions is the mythology, or narrative, that
					accompanies it. This can be a simple oral tradition of stories, or a more
					sophisticated set of scriptures, but often includes a creation story and a
					history of the gods, saints, or prophets, with parables that illustrate and
					reinforce the beliefs of the religion. Every existing faith has a collection of
					sacred texts that articulates its central ideals and narrates the history of the
					tradition. These texts, which in many cases are considered to be have been
					passed directly from the deity, are used in worship and education.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;In many religions, alongside this narrative, is a more sophisticated and
					systematic element, which explains the philosophy and doctrine of the religion,
					and lays out its distinctive theology. Some of these ancillary texts have
					themselves acquired canonical status. There is also often an ethical element,
					with rules of conduct and taboos, and a social element that defines the
					institutions of the religion and of the society it is associated with. Such
					rules are typically concise&mdash;the Ten Commandments of Judaism and
					Christianity, or the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, for example.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-309"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00136.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Religion and morality</h2></div><p class="intro">The idea of good and evil is also fundamental to many faiths, and religion
					often has a function of offering moral guidance to society. The major religions
					differ in their definitions of what constitutes a good life&mdash;and the line
					between moral philosophy and religion is far from clear in belief systems such
					as Confucianism and Buddhism&mdash;but certain basic moral codes have emerged
					that are almost universal. Religious taboos, commandments and so on not only
					ensure that the will of the God or gods is obeyed, but also form a framework for
					society and its laws to enable people to live peaceably together. The spiritual
					leadership that in many religions was given by prophets with divine guidance was
					passed on to a priesthood. This became an essential part of many communities,
					and in some religions has wielded considerable political power.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-311"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000039.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-312" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Death and the afterlife</h2></div><p class="intro">Most religions address the central human concern of death with the promise of
					some kind of continued existence, or afterlife. In eastern traditions, such as
					Hinduism, the soul is believed to be reincarnated after death in a new physical
					form, while other faiths hold that the soul is judged after death and resides in
					a nonphysical heaven or hell. The goal of achieving freedom from the cycle of
					death and rebirth, or achieving immortality encourages believers to follow the
					rules of their faith.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"What religion a man shall have is a historical accident, quite as much as

					the source&mdash;or the banner&mdash;of conflict between them. Although all
					the major traditions hold peace as an essential virtue, they may also make
					provision for the use of force in certain circumstances, for example, to defend
					their faith or to extend their reach. Religion has provided an excuse for
					hostility between powers throughout history. While tolerance is also considered
					a virtue, heretics and infidels have often been persecuted for their beliefs,
					and religion has been the pretext for attempted genocides such as the
					Holocaust.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"All religions, arts, and sciences are branches of the same tree."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Albert Einstein</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-314" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Challenges to faith</h2></div><p class="intro">Faced with the negative aspects of religious belief and equipped with the
					tools of humanist philosophy and science, a number of thinkers have questioned
					the very validity of religion. There were, they argued, logical and consistent
					cosmologies based on reason rather than faith&mdash;in effect, religions had
					become irrelevant in the modern world. New philosophies, such as
					Marxism-Leninism considered religions to be a negative force on human
					development, and as a result there arose communist states that were explicitly
					atheistic and antireligious.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-315" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New directions</h2></div><p class="intro">Responding to societal change and scientific advances, some of the older
					religions have adapted or divided into several branches. Others have steadfastly
					rejected what they see as a heretical progress in an increasingly rational,
					materialistic, and godless world; fundamentalist movements in Christianity,
					Islam, and Judaism have gained many followers who reject the liberal values of
					the modern world.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many people recognize a lack of spirituality in modern
					society, and have turned to charismatic denominations of the major religions, or
					to the many new religious movements that have appeared in the past 200
					years.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, influenced by the New Age movement of the late 20th century, have
					rediscovered ancient beliefs, or sought the exoticism of traditional religions
					with no connection to the modern world. Nevertheless, the major religions of the
					world continue to grow and even today very few countries in the world can be
					seen as truly secular societies.</p></div></div></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-125"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Our early hunter-gatherer ancestors considered the natural world to
				have a supernatural quality. For some, this was expressed in a belief that animals,
				plants, objects, and forces of nature possess a spirit, in the same way that people
				do. In this animistic view of the world, humans are seen as a part of nature, not
				separate from it, and to live in harmony with it, must show respect to the
				spirits.</p><p class="calibre11">Many early peoples sought to explain the world in terms of deities associated with
				particular natural phenomena. The rising of the sun each day, for example, might be
				seen as a release from the darkness of the night, controlled by a sun god;
				similarly, natural cycles such as the phases of the moon and the seasons&mdash;
				vital to these people’s way of life&mdash;were assigned their own deities.
				As well as creating a cosmology to account for the workings of the universe, most
				cultures also incorporated some form of creation story into their belief system.
				Often this was in the form of an analogy with human reproduction, in which a mother
				goddess gave birth to the world, which was in some cases fathered by another god.
				Sometimes these parental deities were personified as animals, or natural features
				such as rivers or the sea, or in the form of mother earth and father sky.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-316"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00375.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Primal religions</span>&mdash;so-called because
						they came first&mdash;were practiced by people throughout the world and are
						key to the development of all modern religions. Some are still active
						today.</p></div></div><div id="calibre_link-317" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Rites and rituals</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The belief systems of most primal religions incorporated some form of
					afterlife, one that was typically related to the existence of a realm separate
					from the physical world&mdash;a place of gods and mythical creatures&mdash; to
					which the spirits of the dead would travel. In some religions, it was thought
					possible to communicate with this other realm and contact the ancestral spirits
					for guidance. A particular class of holy person&mdash;the shaman or
					“medicine man”&mdash;was able to journey there and derive
					mystical healing powers from contact with, and sometimes possession by, the
					spirits.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Early peoples also marked life’s rites of passage; these, along with
					the changing of the seasons, developed into rituals associated with the spirits
					and the deities. The idea of pleasing the gods to ensure good fortune in hunting
					or farming inspired rituals of worship, and, in some cultures, sacrifices to
					offer life to the gods in return for the life they had given to humans.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbolism also played a key role in the religious practices of early cultures.
					Masks, charms, idols, and amulets were used in ceremonies, and spirits were
					believed to occupy them. Certain areas were thought to have religious
					significance, and some communities set aside holy places and sacred burial
					grounds, while others made buildings or villages in the image of the cosmos. A
					few of these primal religions survive to the present day among dwindling numbers
					of tribespeople around the world untouched by Western civilization. Some
					attempts have been made to revive them by indigenous peoples who are trying to
					re-establish lost cultures. Although their belief systems may seem at first
					glance to be primitive to modern eyes, traces of them can still be seen in the
					major religions that have evolved in the modern world, or in the “New
					Age” search for spirituality.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				beyond the visible one in which we live is complex. Motivated by an urge to make
				sense of the world around them&mdash;particularly the dangers and misfortunes they
				faced, and how the necessities of life were provided&mdash;people in early
				societies sought explanations in a realm that was invisible to them, but had an
				influence over their lives.</p><p class="calibre11">The idea of a spirit world is also associated with notions of sleep and death, and
				the interface between these and consciousness, which can be likened to the natural
				phenomenon of night and day. In this twilight zone between sleep and waking, life
				and death, light and dark, lie the dreams, hallucinations, and states of altered
				consciousness that suggest that the visible, tangible world is not the only one, and
				that another, supernatural world also exists&mdash;and has a connection with our
				own. It is easy to imagine how the inhabitants of this other world were thought to
				influence not only our own minds and actions, but also to inhabit the bodies of
				animals and even inanimate objects, and to cause the natural phenomena affecting our
				lives.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-319"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00326.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-320" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A meeting of worlds</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The figures of humans, animals, and human-animal hybrids in Palaeolithic cave
					paintings are often decorated with patterns that are now thought to represent
					the involuntary back-of-the-retina patterns known as
					entoptic phenomena&mdash;visual effects such as dots, grids, zigzags, and wavy
					lines, which appear between waking and sleep, or between vision and
					hallucination. The paintings themselves represent a permeable veil between the
					physical and the spirit worlds.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to ask the Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of Europe about the
					beliefs and rituals that lie behind their cave paintings, but in the 19th
					century it was still possible to record the cultural and religious beliefs of
					the /Xam of southern Africa, a now-extinct clan of San hunter-gatherers who made
					cave paintings reminiscent of those of the Stone Age, for similar reasons. The
					spiritual life of the /Xam San offered a living parallel to the religious ideas
					archaeologists have attributed to early modern humans. Even the clicks of the
					/Xam San language (represented by marks such as /, indicating a dental click
					rather like a tut of disapproval), are thought to survive from
					humankind’s earliest speech.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"The Storm Bird blows his wind into the chests of man and beast, and

					and on the idea that there are both natural and supernatural realms that are
					deeply intertwined. In their three-tiered world, spirit realms lie both above
					and below the middle, or natural, world in which humans live; each is accessible
					to the other, and whatever happens in one directly affects what happens in the
					other. Humans with special powers could visit the upper or sky realm, and travel
					underwater and underground in the lower spirit realm.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For the /Xam San, the world above was inhabited by the creator and trickster
					deity /Kaggen (also known as Mantis) and his family. They shared this world with
					an abundance of game animals, and with the spirits of the dead, including the
					spirits of the Early Race&mdash;a community of hybrid animal-humans, with
					powers to shape, transform, and create. The /Xam believed that these beings were
					the first to inhabit the earth.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-323"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00213.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Natural phenomena</span> such as eclipses,

					significance or personified as spirits. Supernatural figures could take the form
					of the animals they shared their lands with, such as the eland (a type of
					antelope), the meerkat, and the praying mantis. The creator /Kaggen, who dreamed
					the world into being, usually took human form but could transform into almost
					anything, most often a praying mantis or an eland. While he was the protector of
					game animals, he would sometimes transform himself into one in order to be
					killed and feed the people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Early Race were regarded with awe and respect, but not
					worshipped. Not even /Kaggen the Mantis was prayed to, although a San shaman
					such as //<a href="#calibre_link-34" class="calibre2">Kabbo</a> might hope to intercede with /Kaggen to ensure a successful
					hunt. Because /Kaggen is a trickster, many of the myths surrounding him and his
					family are comic rather than reverent; even the key myth of the creation of the
					first eland includes a scene in which an ineffectual /Kaggen is beaten up by a
					family of meerkats.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Important elemental forces and celestial bodies also became characters in
					stories that explained how they came to be, and why they behave in the way that
					they do. The children of the Early Race, for example, threw the sleeping sun up
					into the sky, so that the light that shone from his armpit would illuminate the
					world. It was a girl from the Early Race who made the stars by throwing the
					ashes of a fire into the sky of the Milky Way. Rain was not thought of as a
					natural phenomenon, but as a large animal. A fierce thunderstorm was a
					rain-bull, and a gentle rain was a rain-cow. Special people who had the power to
					summon the rain, such as //Kabbo, would make a supernatural journey to a full
					waterhole to summon a rain-cow, and then bring it back through the sky to the
					place in need of water. There he would kill the rain-cow so that its blood and
					milk fell down as rain on the earth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain was a vital necessity in the arid desert landscape in which the /Xam
					lived. It was essential to replenish the widely scattered waterholes that they
					moved between, and which were linked to each other by a complex web of story and
					myth, known as <i class="calibre4">kukummi</i> and similar to the
						<a href="#calibre_link-35" class="calibre2">Dreamings of the Australian
						Aborigines</a>.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"My mother told me that the girl [of the Early Race] put her

					interaction of the supernatural beings with humans&mdash;how they have an
					interest in this world, and how humans can, in turn, act to influence and please
					them. All San peoples believe that the spirit realms are accessible, in altered
					states of consciousness, to those who have a supernatural potency, known as
						<i class="calibre4">!gi</i>, imparted to humans and animals by
					their creator. The trance dance is the key religious ritual in which the San can
					use this power to access the spirit world, via trance, and launch their
					essential selves up through the top of their heads and into the spirit world.
					There, they may plead for the lives of the sick, and return with healing power
					so that they can drive out the arrows of disease fired by the dead from the
					other world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The /Xam offered prayers to the moon and stars to give them access to
					spiritual power, as well as good luck in hunting. When /Xam people entered a
					state of altered consciousness, it was believed that they were temporarily dead,
					and that their hearts had become stars. Humans and the stars were so intimately
					linked that when a person actually died, “the star feels that our heart
					falls over [and] the star falls down on account of it. For the
					stars know the time at which we die.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;After death, the links in /Xam belief between the worlds of human experience,
					of spirits, and of natural phenomena become even more apparent. The hair of a
					deceased person was believed to transform into clouds, which then shelter humans
					from the heat of the sun. Death was described in elemental terms: the wind that
					exists inside every human being was said to blow away their footprints when they
					died, making the transition between the world of the living and the world of the
					dead a decisive one. If the footprints remained, “it would seem as if we
					still lived.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"A long time ago, the baboons were little men just like us, but more

					//Kabbo, who in the 1870s was one of several /Xam San released from prison into
					the custody of Dr. Wilhelm Bleek, who wished to learn their language and study
					their culture. They had been jailed for crimes such as stealing a sheep to feed
					their starving families. //Kabbo spoke of his waterholes, between which his
					family would move in the arid desert of the central Cape Colony, camping some
					way from the water so as not to frighten off the animals that came to drink the
					brackish water. Wilhelm Bleek said of him: “This gentle old soul
					appeared lost in a dream life of his own,” and in fact the name //Kabbo
					means “dream.” The god /Kaggen was said to have dreamed the world
					into being, and //Kabbo had a special relationship with him; as a
					/Kaggen-ka !kwi, a “mantis’s man” he was able to
					enter a dream state to exercise powers such as rainmaking, healing, and hunting

				Ainu have close cultural ties with other inhabitants of the north Pacific
				Rim&mdash;Siberian peoples (such as the Chukchi, Koryak, and Yupik) and the Inuit
				of Canada and Alaska. These peoples share, in particular, an animistic view of the
				world, in which every being and object that exists has a spirit that can act, speak,
				and walk by itself. They also believe that the spiritual and physical worlds are
				separated by only a thin, permeable membrane.</p><p class="calibre11">The Ainu consider the body to be simply a container for the spirit; after death,
				the spirit passes out of the mouth and nostrils, and arrives in the next world to be
				reborn as a kamuy, a word meaning both god and spirit. When the kamuy dies in the
				next world, it is reborn in this one. It will always reincarnate in the same species
				and gender&mdash;a man will always be a man, for example.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Kamuy</i> can be animals, plants, minerals,
				geographical or natural phenomena, or even tools and utensils produced by humans.
				Because all spirits, even those of inanimate objects, are considered immortal, after
				death a person’s house may beburned to ensure that his or her kamuy will have
				a home in the other world; their tools and implements may also be broken (to release
				the spirits inside) and buried with the body, for use again in the next
				world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-328"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00262.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-329" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The power of words</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Some kamuy have roles in both the supernatural and human worlds.
					Kotan-kor-kamuy, for example, is the creator god, but he is also the god of the
					village, and may manifest himself on earth as a long-eared owl.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans and kamuy have a close relationship&mdash;so close that kamuy have
					been described as “gods you can argue with.” The kamuy can be
					prayed to, using special carved prayer sticks, but the ritual relationship is
					based more on mutual respect and correct behavior than on worship. If someone
					has angered a god by carelessness or disrespect, they must conduct a ceremony to
					express their remorse. If, however, a person has treated a god with due respect
					and performed all the appropriate rituals, yet still receives bad luck, the Ainu
					can ask the fire goddess, Fuchi, to compel that god to apologize and make
					recompense.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ainu belief, even words are spirits, and the use of words is one of the
					gifts that humans have that gods and things do not. Words can be used to make
					bargains with both gods and things, and also to give pleasure to the gods. For
					example, the Ainu epic songs known as kamuy yukar, or “songs of the
					gods,” are sung in the first person, from the perspective of kamuy rather
					than humans, and it is said the kamuy take delight in watching humans dance and

				widespread religious practices, based on a belief in spirits who can be influenced
				by shamans. These shamans, men or women, are believed to be special people who
				possess great power and knowledge. After entering an altered state of consciousness,
				or trance, they are able to travel to other worlds and interact with the spirits who
				live there.</p><p class="calibre11">Bargaining with the powerful spirits who control these other worlds is often a key
				aspect of the shaman’s activities. For example, the shaman often requests the
				release of game animals (essential in some traditional societies) from the spirit
				world into this world, to gain insight into the future, or for remedies to cure the
				sick. In return, the spirits may ask humans (via the shaman, who acts as an
				intermediary) to make offerings to them or to observe certain rules and codes of
				conduct.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shamans play an important role as healers of the sick; this role emphasizes that
				their journeys are not simply personal and private, but are undertaken primarily to
				alleviate suffering and hardship in the community. This function is reflected in
				some of the (now largely obsolete) terms that have been used to describe shamans,
				such as witchdoctors in sub-Saharan Africa and medicine men in North America.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, shamanism was a dominant feature of many societies from around 45,000
				years ago up until the modern era. The Vikings, practiced a form of shamanic
				divination known as <i class="calibre4">seiðr</i> between the 8th
				and 11th centuries; and shamanic elements appear in the medieval myths of the Norse
				god Odin, who hanged himself in an initiation sacrifice on the World Tree
				(“the axis of the universe”).</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 16th and 17th centuries, shamanic traces were evident in the Benandanti
				spirit-battlers (an agrarian fertility cult) of Friuli, Italy, and in the
				night-flying seely wights (fairylike nature spirits) of Scotland. In more recent
				times, the <i class="calibre4">mazzeri</i> dream-hunters of Corsica show
				clear shamanic influence.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-333"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00122.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"We believe in dreams, and we believe that people can live a life apart from

					Scandinavia, in the area now known as Sápmi (formerly Lapland). Here the
					Sami people, semi-nomadic reindeer herders and coastal fishers, maintained a
					fully shamanic religion into the early 18th century, which has been partially
					revived in recent decades. Their religion can be reconstructed from historical
					sources as well as from close comparison with related cultures in North Asia and
					the American Arctic.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami shamans, or <i class="calibre4">noaidi</i>, could inherit
					their calling or be chosen directly by the spirits. In some other cultures,
					those chosen to be shamans often experienced a period of intense illness and
					stress, as well as visionary episodes in which they might be killed and then
					brought back to life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami shamans had helping spirits in the form of animals, such as wolves,
					bears, reindeer, or fish, whom they imitated when entering a trance. Shamans are
					often said to become the animal they imitate; this occurs through a process of
					interior transformation rather than by visible, exterior change.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things helped the Sami shaman enter a trance. The first was intense
					physical deprivation, often achieved by working naked in the freezing Arctic
					temperatures. The second was the rhythmic beat of the sacred rune drum (among
					similar peoples, such as the Yakut and Buryat, the drum is called the
					shaman’s horse); the drum was decorated with images of the world of the
					gods above, the world of the dead below, and the world inhabited by humans (the
					earth)&mdash;the three realms connected by the World Tree. The third way the
					shaman was helped to enter a trance was through the ingestion of the
					psychotropic (mind-altering) fly agaric mushroom (<i class="calibre4">Amanita muscaria</i>). After taking the mushroom, the shaman would
					fall into a trance and become rigid and immobile, as if dead. During this
					process, male Sami guarded the shaman, while the women sang songs about the
					tasks to be performed in the upper or lower realms, and songs to help the shaman
					find his or her way home.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stories are told of Sami shamans who never returned from the other world,
					often because those responsible for waking them with a spell had
					forgotten the magic words. One shaman was said to have been lost for three
					years, until the person acting as his guardian remembered that his soul needed
					to be recalled from “the coil of the pike’s intestine, in the
					third dark corner.” When the relevant words were spoken, the
					shaman’s legs trembled, and he awoke, cursing his guardian.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Mankind does not end its existence because sickness or some other accident

					(the cosmic axis) before entering the spirit world, either above or below the
					mountain. They might typically ride on a fish spirit, be guided by a bird
					spirit, and protected by a reindeer spirit. A journey to the upper world of
					Saivo would be undertaken in order to plead for game or for help of some other
					kind; a journey to the underworld of Jabmeaymo would be made to fetch back the
					soul of a sick person. This could only be done after the mistress of the
					underworld had been placated with offerings. The shamans were able to
					communicate with the spirits in the upper and lower worlds because their
					shamanic training involved learning the secret language of the spirits.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Netsilingmiut (Netsilik Inuit) shamans&mdash;an Arctic culture, from
					present-day Canada (west of Hudson Bay)&mdash;had similar religious beliefs to
					the Sami. As well as subduing storms and acting as healers, they also mediated
					between the human world and the spirits of the earth, air, and sea. A shamanic
					seance was always held in subdued light, in a snow hut or a tent. The shaman
					would summon his helping spirits by singing special songs. After falling into a
					trance, he would speak in a voice that was not his own&mdash;most often in a
					deep, resonant bass, but sometimes in a shrill falsetto.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;While in this trance state, the shaman could send his soul up into the sky to
					visit Tatqiq, the moon man, who was thought to bring fertility to women and good
					luck in hunting. If he was pleased with the offerings the shamans made to him,
					he would reward them with animals. When the moon was not visible in the sky, the
					Netsilik believed that he had gone hunting for animals to feed the dead.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-337"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000147.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">In some Arctic cultures,</span> animals are
							believed to have spirit guardians who protect them and ensure their
							well-being. Shamans have the power to negotiate with these guardians, on
							behalf of human beings, for the release of animals from the spirit world
							into the human world for hunting and fishing.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Into the sky, under the sea</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to one Netsilik account, one day the great shaman Kukiaq was trying
					to catch seals from a breathing hole in the ice. He gazed upward and realized
					that the moon was gradually moving toward him. It hovered above his head and
					transformed into a whalebone sledge. The driver, Tatqiq, gestured to Kukiaq to
					join him, and whisked him off to his house in the sky. The entrance of the house
					moved like a chewing mouth, and in one of the rooms the sun was nursing a baby.
					Although the moon asked Kukiaq to stay, he was anxious he would not be able to
					find his way home. So he slid back to earth on a moonbeam, landing safely at the
					very same breathing hole he had left from.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, however, the Netsilik shamans would send their souls down to visit
					Nuliayuk (also known as Sedna), the mistress of sea and land animals, at the
					bottom of the ocean. Nuliayuk possessed the power to either withhold or release
					the seals on which the Netsilik depended for food and clothing. She therefore
					had great influence over them. When the Netsilik broke any of her strict taboos,
					she would imprison the seals. However, if the shamans ventured down to her
					watery underworld to braid her hair, she was usually appeased and would release
					the seals into the open sea.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The shamanic tradition of the Netsiliks lasted into the 1930s and 1940s.
					Within the Netsilik community, only the shamans (or <i class="calibre4">angatkut</i>)&mdash;who were protected by their own guardian
					spirits&mdash;were unafraid of the dangerous and malevolent spirits that filled
					the world. A Netsilik shaman might have several helping spirits. For example,
					the spirits of the shaman Unarâluk were his dead mother and father, the
					sun, a dog, and a sea scorpion. These spirits informed Unarâluk about
					what existed on, and beneath, the earth, and in the sea and sky.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Everything comes from Nuliayuk&mdash;food and clothes, hunger and bad

					carpet-snake people, lived there. To the west lived the Windulka, or mulga-seed
					men, who invited the Kunia to a ceremony. The Kunia men set out, but, after
					stopping at the Uluru waterhole, they met some Metalungana, or sleepy-lizard
					women, and forgot about the invitation. The Windulka sent the bell bird
					Panpanpalana to find the Kunia. The Kunia men told the bird they could no longer
					attend since they had just gotten married. Affronted, the Windulka asked their
					friends the Liru, the poisonous-snake people, to attack the Kunia. During a
					furious battle, the Liru overcame the Kunia, who surrounded their dying leader,
					Ungata, and sang themselves to death. During the battle, Uluru was formed. Three
					rock holes high on Uluru mark the place Ungata bled to death, and the water that

				particularly important to societies in the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica,
				notably the Mayans and the Aztecs.</p><p class="calibre11">The Mesoamerican peoples inhabited the area from presentday central Mexico through
				to Nicaragua. The Mayan civilization (which peaked c.250 CE&ndash;900 CE) preceded
				and then coincided with the Aztec civilization, which reached its height around 1300&ndash;1400 CE. Aztec culture drew on the Mayan tradition and the two peoples had
				several deities in common; they went by different names but shared
				characteristics.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-363"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00346.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A reciprocal gift of blood</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Mesoamerican cultures believed that blood sacrifice to their gods was
					essential to ensure the survival of their worlds, in a tradition of ritual
					bloodletting that dated back to the first major civilization in Mexico&mdash;that of the Olmecs, which flourished between 1500 and 400 BCE. In legends, the
					gods themselves had made tremendous sacrifices in forming the world, which
					included shedding their own blood to create humankind; therefore they desired
					similar sacrifices of blood from humanity in return.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Sacrifice and creation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The power of blood and the necessity of sacrifice are central to the Aztec
					creation myth. The Aztecs believed that the gods had created and destroyed four
					earlier eras, or suns, and that after the destruction of the fourth sun by
					flood, the god of the wind, Quetzalcoatl, and his trickster brother,
					Tezcatlipoca, tore the goddess (or god in some versions) Tlaltecuhtli in half to
					make a new heaven and earth. From her body grew everything necessary for the
					life of humankind&mdash;trees, flowers, grass, fountains, wells, valleys, and
					mountains. All this caused the goddess terrible agony, and she howled through
					the night demanding the sacrifice of human hearts to sustain her.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Further cosmic acts of creation followed, all requiring sacrifice or blood
					offerings. One relief shows the first stars being born from blood flowing from
					Quetzalcoatl’s tongue after he had pierced it. Most notably, the creation
					of the fifth sun required one of the gods to cast himself into a funeral pyre.
					Two gods, Tecuciztecatl and Nanahuatzin, vied for the honor, both immolating
					themselves; Nanahuatzin became the sun and Tecuciztecatl the moon. The other
					gods then offered their hearts in order to make the new sun move across the sky
					(the offering of hearts is a recurring theme in Mesoamerican myth and
					ritual).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-366"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00256.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Victims of Aztec human sacrifice</span> were

							the gods.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Humanity’s gruesome debt</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Both the Mayans and the Aztecs were bound to their gods by a blood debt from
					these acts of creation that could never be repaid. After Quetzalcoatl descended
					to the underworld and retrieved the bones of former humans (remains from the
					four previous eras), the gods ground them into a fine meal flour. They let their
					own blood drip onto the flour to animate it and created a new race of
					people&mdash;people whose hearts could in turn satisfy the gods’ own
					need for blood.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mesoamerican myth, each period of 52 years was seen as a cycle, the end of
					which could spell the end of the world. Human sacrifice could be used to appease
					the gods and persuade them not to bring an end to the present age&mdash;that of
					the fifth sun. The Mayans believed that blood sacrifice was necessary for the
					sun to rise in the sky every morning.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aztecs’ sun god, Huitzilopochtli, was locked in an ongoing struggle
					with darkness and needed to be fortified by blood in order for the sun to
					continue in its cycle. Thus the continued existence of the Mesoamerican world
					was seen as extremely tenuous, and in need of constant support through acts of
					sacrifice.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloodletting for the gods took two forms: autosacrifice (self-inflicted
					bloodletting) and human sacrifice. Both Mayans and Aztecs took part in
					autosacrifice. Mesoamerican nobles had what was seen as the privilege and
					responsibility to shed their own blood for the gods. This involved piercing
					their flesh with stingray spines, obsidian knives, and, most often, with the
					sharp spines of the maguey (agave) plant. Blood was drawn from the ear, shin,
					knee, elbow, tongue, or foreskin. Autosacrifice dates back to the Olmec people
					and continued after the Spanish Conquest of Mexico in 1519. Both men and women
					of the Mayan nobility took part&mdash;the men drawing blood from their
					foreskins, women from their tongues. They collected their offerings on strips of
					bark paper, which were then burned; through the smoke from these offerings, they
					communicated with their ancestors and the gods.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"You have yet to take care of bleeding your ears and passing a cord through

					performed it only in special circumstances, such as the consecration of a new
					temple.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aztec sacrifice usually involved cutting the victim’s heart from his
					body. The heart was believed to be a fragment of the sun’s energy
					&mdash;so removing the heart was a means of returning the energy to its source.
					The victim was typically held by four priests over a stone slab in the temple,
					while a fifth cut the heart from the body with an obsidian knife, and offered
					it, still beating, to the gods in a vessel called a <i class="calibre4">cuauhxicalli</i>, an eagle gourd After the removal of the heart, the
					body was rolled down the stairs of the pyramid-shaped temple to the stone
					terrace at the base. The victim’s head was removed and the arms and legs
					might also be cut off. Skulls were displayed on a skull rack. Depending on the
					particular god being honored in the sacrifice, victims might be slain in ritual
					combat, drowned, shot with arrows, or flayed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of sacrifice sometimes reached immense proportions: for example, at
					the rededication of the Aztec temple of Huitzilopochtli, at Tenochtitlan, in
					1487, around 80,400 victims were said to have been sacrificed to the god, their
					clotted blood forming great pools in the temple precinct. Even if a more modest
					estimate of 20,000 victims is accepted, this was still slaughter on a vast
					scale.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aztec ritual year was marked by sacrifices to various gods and goddesses.
					Although the gods could also be propitiated with smoke from incense and tobacco,
					and with food and precious objects, blood was what they really craved.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"And this goddess cried many times in the night desiring the hearts of men

					and the Aztecs. At the end of each year in Aztec society, a man representing
					Mictlantecuhtli, the god of the underworld, was sacrificed in the temple named
					Tlalxicco, “the navel of the world.” It is thought that the victim
					was then eaten by the priests. Just as human flesh sustained the gods, so by
					consuming a god (embodied in the sacrificial victim) a form of communion could
					be enacted. Less high-ranking celebrants ate figures made from dough, into which
					sacrificial blood was mixed. To break apart and consume these dough figures,
					known as <i class="calibre4">tzoalli</i>, was also to commune with
					the gods.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reenactment of the myths of the gods was a feature of Aztec belief and of
					annual rituals. During the main festival of Xipe Totec, the flayed deity, a
					priest impersonating the god donned the flayed skin of a sacrificed captive. As
					the skin tightened and tore away, the impersonator emerged like a fresh shoot
					growing from the rotting husk of a seed, representing growth and renewal. Other
					Aztec sacrifices honor the importance of corn, their staple food. Every year, a
					young girl representing Chicomecoatl, the maize goddess, was sacrificed at
					harvest time. She was decapitated, her blood poured over a statue of the
					goddess, and her skin worn by a priest.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-370"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00208.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Descendants of the Mayans,</span> the Tzotzil

					At death, this soul travels to <i class="calibre4">Katibak,</i> the

				significance in cultures in which religious and daily life were intertwined. This
				was true of the earth lodges, or ceremonial centers, of the Pawnee, one of the

				architecture, making each lodge a miniature cosmos as <a href="#calibre_link-235" class="calibre2">Tirawahat</a>, the creator god and chief of all
				the gods, had prescribed at the beginning of time, after he had made the heavens and

				the altar, which the spirit of Tirawahat was said to occupy when the first rays of
				sun shone on it in the morning. Through this skull, Tirawahat was said to live and
				communicate with the people. Sacred star bundles containing objects used for

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-156"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">The earliest civilizations emerged when scattered nomadic tribes
				began to settle in order to raise crops. Previously localized religious beliefs and
				practices evolved, and the beliefs of different tribes amalgamated around common
				deities and mythologies. Complex pantheons emerged, and an often sophisticated body
				of myths arose from the various strands that had come together, describing the role
				of the gods and mythical creatures in the workings of the world.</p><p class="calibre11">These more formal religions offered explanations for natural phenomena, such as
				the sun, moon, seasons, weather, and the gods’ influence on them. They often
				included creation stories and tales of the interaction of gods and humans. It is
				clear from elaborate tombs left by the early civilizations, such as the Egyptians,
				that belief in an afterlife existed, and that rituals of death and burial played a
				major part in religion. As people settled in ever bigger communities, temples
				dedicated to the gods became focal points in the towns and cities.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilization also gave rise to various forms of written language, which allowed
				these stories of gods and creation to be recorded and embellished over the
				millennia. Religious inscriptions first appeared on the walls of tombs and temples
				in early civilizations, such as that of Egypt. Elsewhere, distinctive traditions
				were also taking shape as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Norse, and Celtic folk
				religions were incorporated into the belief systems of the emerging nations.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-389"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-390" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Coalescing faiths</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By about 1500 BCE, regional religious traditions were well established in many
					parts of the world, and new, more advanced, societies arose, requiring more
					elaborate belief systems. Some new religions also appeared, notably
					Zoroastrianism, which was arguably the first monotheistic faith, while the
					foundations of Judaism were also being laid down.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, the numerous local religious beliefs were incorporated into the
					Vedic tradition, based on ancient scriptures called the Vedas. This later became
					the pluralistic amalgam now known as Hinduism, but alongside this came Jainism,
					which placed more emphasis on a correct way of life than on the worship of
					deities, and Buddhism, which was arguably more a philosophy than a religion, as
					it concentrated on enlightenment without the need for gods.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This focus on moral philosophy was also prevalent in the religions that
					evolved in China and Japan. In the ordered society of the great Chinese
					dynasties, religion and political organization became intertwined. Daoism,
					proposed by the legendary scholar Laozi, advocated a religious way of life
					compatible with Chinese society. Confucius built on this to develop a new belief
					system based on a reinterpretation of respect for the hierarchy, and reinforced
					by ritual. Later, in Japan, traditional religions were unified to create the
					state religion, Shinto, which showed special reverence to ancestors and
					encouraged followers to connect with them through ritual practices.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 6th century BCE, the Greek city-states had been established, and
					classical Greek civilization was exerting a strong influence on the eastern
					Mediterranean region. Religion (although the Greeks did not have a specific word
					for it) was very much a part of life, and, although the gods were believed to
					live separately from the people, they were imagined to lead remarkably similar
					lives. The history of the Greek people, as interpreted by Homer in his epic
					poems, was also the history of their gods. The hierarchy of deities, with their
					very human lifestyles and tempestuous relationships, mirrored Greek society. As
					well as offering an explanation for aspects of the world, the deities gave
					reasons for the vagaries of human behavior, and with their help it was possible
					to divine the future, choose auspicious times for action, and even defeat
					enemies. Most of the time they existed alongside people, unconcerned with human
					affairs, but, to keep them happy, the Greeks erected temples, performed rituals,
					and held regular festivals.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the early civilizations rose and fell, many of their beliefs faded away, or
					were incorporated into the religions that replaced them; the pantheon of Greek

				cities. As these larger settlements grew, so did the need for new social structures,
				a common culture, and shared beliefs in order to unify the population and reinforce
				the political system. Religion not only explained natural phenomena but also
				provided a coherent mythology. In the 4th millennium BCE, the Sumerian people
				inhabited the region. The population of Sumer was concentrated in about a dozen
				city-states; each was ruled by a king, but political power was vested in the high
				priests of each city’s religion. The Sumerians worshipped a pantheon of gods,
				including Enki, god of water and fertility, and Anu, god of heaven. When the
				Babylonians began to settle in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BCE, they absorbed
				the Sumerians and their culture&mdash;including some aspects of their
				mythology&mdash;into their own empire. The Babylonian leaders used the Sumerian
				mythology to reinforce the hierarchy they established, which helped to assert their
				power over their own people and the supplanted Sumerians.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-392"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00360.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-393" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Babylonian religion</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Central to the Babylonian religion was the epic creation story of the

					Sumerian god Enki and the rightful heir to Anu. The story tells of Marduk as the

					including the <a href="#calibre_link-93" class="calibre2">creator god, Tiamat</a> gave him the power to create and organize the universe,
					which he ruled from his chosen home of Babylon. The Enûma Elish provided

					enabled Marduk to settle the destinies of the stars and planets for the year
					ahead. Both in its mythology and its ritual, the Akitu was fundamentally about
					legitimizing kingship; it was a public demonstration that the Babylonian monarch

					Anshar and Kishu, the horizons of the sky and the earth, who themselves beget
					Anu, the god of the sky, and Ea (the Sumerian Enki), the god of the earth and
					water. The shouts of the young gods disturb Apsu and Tiamat’s peace, so
					Apsu attempts to destroy them, but is killed by Ea. At the site of this
					struggle, the god Ea creates a temple for himself, which he names Apsu (after
					his father), where his son Marduk is born. To avenge her husband, Tiamat wages
					war on Marduk, and puts her son Qingu in command of her forces. Marduk agrees to
					fight Tiamat’s army, if all the other gods accept him as king, with
					sovereignty over the universe. Marduk then kills Tiamat and Qingu, and brings
					order to the universe. From Qingu’s blood he creates mankind.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-18" class="calibre2">Created for a purpose</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre2">Renewing life through ritual</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-32" class="calibre2">Beliefs that mirror society</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-39" class="calibre2">A rational world</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				goods and art, but it would not be true to say that they were obsessed with death.
				Instead, they were preparing for the afterlife.</p><p class="calibre11">All their mortuary rituals of embalming, mummification, entombment, and
				remembrance were aimed at ensuring new life after death. Egyptians wanted to live
				after their death as perfected beings in Aaru, the field of reeds, which was itself
				a perfected version of the Egypt they already knew.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaru was the domain of Osiris, lord of the dead. In it, the blessed dead gathered
				rich crops of barley and emmer wheat&mdash;abundant harvests that are joyously

				physical body, the name, the shadow, the ka (spiritual life force), the ba
				(personality), and the akh (the perfected being that could enjoy life in paradise).
				To ensure life in paradise, care needed to be taken of all these constituent parts.
				The body had to be preserved by mummification and buried with a set of funerary
				equipment, including jars containing the internal organs, in rituals that identified
				the deceased with the god Osiris. Reenacting the death and resurrection of the god
				prepared the deceased for the journey to the next world.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Every stage of mummification was accompanied by religious ritual. Embalmers
				enacted the role of the jackal-headed god, Anubis, who was the protective god of the
				dead; Anubis invented the mysteries of embalming in order to resurrect the slain
				Osiris. Embalming spells reassured the deceased: “You will live again, you
				will live forever.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-397"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00220.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-398" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The journey of the dead</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The preservation of the physical body by mummification was important because

				the first recorded monotheistic faiths. It was founded by the prophet figure
				Zoroaster in ancient Persia (modern Iran).</p><p class="calibre11">Zoroaster’s religion developed from the old system of Indo-Iranian gods,
				which included Ahura Mazda, lord of wisdom. In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda
				(sometimes called Ohrmazd) is elevated to become the one supreme god, the wise
				creator who is the source of all good, and represents order and truth, in opposition
				to evil and chaos.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahura Mazda is assisted by his creations, the Amesha Spenta or bounteous
				immortals: six divine spirits. A seventh and less easily definable Spenta is the
				Spenta Mainyu, who is seen as Mazda’s own “bounteous spirit,”
				and the agent of his will.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Zoroastrianism, the good Ahura Mazda has been locked in struggle with
				the evil entity Ahriman (also called Angra Mainyu, or destructive spirit) since time
				began. Ahriman and Ahura Mazda are regarded as twin spirits; however, Ahriman is a
				fallen being, and cannot be considered Ahura Mazda’s equal. Ahura Mazda lives
				in the light, while his twin lurks in the dark. Their struggle, as evil endlessly
				attempts to vanquish good, forms the entire body of Zoroastrian mythology.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahura Mazda battles with Ahriman using the creative energy of his spirit, Spenta
				Mainyu; the exact relationship between these three entities remains an unresolved
				aspect of the religion. Human beings, also Mazda’s creation, have an
				important role in keeping disorder and evil at bay by using their free will to do
				good. Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds support <i class="calibre4">asha</i>, the fundamental order of the universe. <i class="calibre4">Asha</i> is seen as being constantly at risk from the opposing principle
				of <i class="calibre4">druj</i>, chaos, which feeds on bad thoughts, bad
				words, and bad deeds. The essential opposition is between creation and uncreation,
				with evil threatening at all times to undermine the ordered structure of the
				world.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of Zoroaster, with his destiny to recruit humankind to the fight between
				good and evil, tipped the battle in favor of goodness. According to Zoroastrianism,
				it is good that will ultimately prevail.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-402"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00080.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"The goodness of the wise Creator can be inferred from the act of

					he made the Amesha Spenta and a spiritual, invisible world, which included a
					perfect being. The spiritual nature of this world was intended to foil Ahriman,
					who tries to attack it nevertheless. Ahura Mazda defeats Ahriman by reciting the
					holiest Zoroastrian prayer, the Ahunavar, which casts him back into the
					darkness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahura Mazda then gives material form to his spiritual world. He creates one
					primal animal (a bull), and his perfect spiritual being becomes a human being,
					known as Gayomart (meaning mortal or human life).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not long, however, before Ahriman recovers and renews his attack. He
					breaks through the sky in a blaze of fire, bringing with him starvation,
					disease, pain, lust, and death. He also creates demons of his own. Gayomart and
					the bull ultimately die, but upon their deaths, their semen spills on the ground
					and is fertilized by the sun. Ahura Mazda sends rain, which brings forth, from
					the seed of Gayomart, the mother and father of humanity: Mashya and Mashyoi.
					Meanwhile, the bull’s seed gives rise to all the other animals of the
					world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his perfect creation has been spoiled by Ahriman’s
					destructiveness, Ahura Mazda sets a limit on time, which was previously

					lived, but c.1400&ndash;1200 BCE seems likely. Although his teachings draw on
					early Hindu texts such as the Rig-Veda, he regarded his religious insights into
					these texts as visions received directly from God. Zoroaster was already a
					priest among seminomadic, pastoral Iranians on the south Russian steppes when he
					began to preach the worship of Ahura Mazda. At first he found few followers, but
					he did convert a local ruler, who made Zoroastrianism the official religion of
					the Avestan people. However, it was not until the reign of Cyrus the Great, in
					the 6th century BCE, that the religion spread across the Persian empire.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">4th century BCE</b> Zoroaster’s

					active principle of evil, explains why they may be tempted to do wrong. It also
					explains how evil can exist in the presence of a good god. Zoroastrian texts
					state: “What is complete and perfect in its goodness cannot produce evil.
					If it could, then it would not be perfect. If God is perfect in goodness and
					knowledge, plainly ignorance and evil cannot proceed from him.” This is
					to say that Ahura Mazda cannot be responsible for the presence of evil in the
					world: the source of this is Ahriman. The fact that Ahura Mazda has given
					humankind free will means that every moment of an individual’s existence
					requires a choice to be made between what is right and what is wrong, and that
					it is our responsibility to choose good over evil.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This focus on moral choice makes Zoroastrianism a religion in which personal
					responsibility and morality are paramount, not only in conceptual terms but as
					practiced in day-to-day life. Human virtues worthy of, and helpful to, Ahura
					Mazda include truthfulness, loyalty, tolerance, forgiveness, respect for
					one’s elders, and the keeping of promises. Vices such as anger,
					arrogance, vengefulness, bad language, and greed are condemned&mdash;and not

					when they die and once at a Last Judgment at the end of time. The two judgments
					will address, respectively, the individual’s morality of thought and his
					or her morality of action. In both cases, moral failings are punished in hell.
					However, these punishments are not eternal; they cease when the person corrects
					their moral failing in the afterlife&mdash;which, once successfully
					accomplished, is followed by the person going to dwell with Ahura Mazda in
					heaven.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoroastrian teachings tell that as the end of time draws near, the Saoshyant
					(savior) will arise and prepare the world to be made anew, helping Ahura Mazda
					to destroy Ahriman. People will grow pure and stop eating meat, then milk,
					plants, and water, until at last they need nothing. When all have chosen good
					over evil, there will be no more sin, so Az, the demon of lust made by Ahriman,
					will starve, turning on her creator. Ahura Mazda will cast Ahriman from creation
					through the hole that Ahriman made when he broke in. It is at this point that
					time will be at an end.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Saoshyant will then raise the dead, who will pass through a stream of molten
					metal to burn away their sins. According to Zoroastrianism, the world will begin
					again, but this time it will be a world everlasting, free of taint.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of fire and molten metal as a purifier in the Last Judgment is
					reflected in the prominence of fire in Zoroastrianism as a symbol of sanctity.
					It is seen as the purest of the elements. Ahura Mazda is strongly associated
					with fire and also the sun. For this reason, Zoroastrian temples always keep a
					fire burning, symbolizing their god’s eternal power. Some temple fires
					have been kept burning for centuries. Believers bring offerings of wood (the
					only fuel used), and fire priests place these in the flames. Visitors are

					Mani felt that his Religion of Light completed the teachings of Zoroaster,
					Buddha, and Christ.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Zoroaster, Mani saw the world as an eternal struggle between the forces
					of good and evil, light and darkness. This was to have a profound effect on

					sole creator; he and Ahriman are the sons of a preexisting god, Zurvan (Time).
					This doctrine arose from the reasoning that, if Mazda and Ahriman were twin
					spirits (as texts said), they needed a progenitor. Zurvan, a neutral,

				concerning nature and harmony, but its first text, attributed to the philosopher
				Laozi, was written in the 6th century BCE&mdash;an unusually active time for ideas
				that also saw the emergence of Confucianism in China, both Jainism and Buddhism in
				India, and early Greek philosophy. Laozi’s book, the <i class="calibre4">Daode jing</i> (The Way and Its Power) identified the <i class="calibre4">dao</i>, or Way, as the power or principle that underlies
				and sustains all things and is the source of order in the universe. Following the
					<i class="calibre4">dao</i>, rather than hindering or obstructing it,
				not only helps to ensure cosmic harmony, but also leads to personal spiritual
				development and a virtuous, fulfilled, and possibly longer life. What it means to
				follow the <i class="calibre4">dao</i> is succinctly expressed in the
				more modern phrase, “going with the flow.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-414"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00179.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-415"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00340.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">For life to run smoothly</span> along the Way, we

					It is life that eddies and swirls around the <i class="calibre4">dao</i> and, to keep to its path, people must detach themselves from
					material concerns and disruptive emotions such as ambition and anger. They
					should instead live a peaceful, simple life, acting spontaneously and in harmony
					with nature, rather than acting on impulses from the self. This is the concept
					of <i class="calibre4">wu wei</i>, or inaction, inherent in the
						<i class="calibre4">dao</i>; as the <i class="calibre4">Daode
						jing</i> says, “the Way never acts, and yet nothing is left
					undone.” In daily life, Laozi placed great emphasis on those virtues that
					encourage <i class="calibre4">wu wei</i>: humility, submissiveness,
					non-interference, passivity, and detachment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of Laozi came from long contemplation of the nature of the universe
					and its constituents, which in Chinese philosophy are yin and yang. Yin
					comprises all that is dark, moist, soft, cold, and feminine; all that is light,
					dry, hard, warm, and masculine is yang. Everything is made of yin and yang, and
					harmony is achieved when the two are kept in balance. In Daoism such balance is
					sought in mind, spirit, and body through practices such as meditation and
					t’ai chi: physical, mental, and spiritual exercises intended to balance
					the flow of qi, the life force, through the body.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rule of the Han dynasty (206 BCE&ndash;220 CE), Daoist philosophy
					became a religion. Its meditative practices were thought to guide experts to
					immortality. In the <i class="calibre4">Daode jing</i> itself, the
					notion of immortality is not intended literally. Someone who completely accepts
					the <i class="calibre4">dao</i> reaches a plane above the material,
					and achieves immortality by detachment. But the statement that, for the sage,
					“there is no realm of death,” was to be taken more literally by
					followers of the Daoist religion, who believed that actual immortality could be
					achieved through acceptance of the Way.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,

				practice self-denial in order to progress toward moksha, release from constant
				rebirth into this world of suffering. Jainism as we know it was founded by Mahavira,
				a contemporary of Buddha, in the 6th century BCE. However, Jainism takes a long view
				of its own historical development: it is said that it has always existed and always
				will exist. Within the faith, Mahavira is simply regarded as the most recent of 24
				enlightened teachers in the current era. Jains believe each era lasts for millions
				of years and recurs in an infinite cycle of ages. These teachers are called
					<i class="calibre4">jinas</i>, or more commonly, <i class="calibre4">tirthankaras</i>: “builders of the ford across the
				ocean of rebirth.” By following the path of self-denial taught by the
					<i class="calibre4">tirthankaras</i>, Jains hope to free their souls
				from the entanglements of material existence. Without this hope, life is simply a
				continuous cycle of life, death, and reincarnation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-420"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00060.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-421" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Personal responsibility</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Jainism does not recognize any deity, placing full responsibility on the
					actions and conduct of the individual. In order to adhere to a life of
					self-denial, Jain monks and nuns take what are called the Five Great Vows
					&mdash;non-violence (ahimsa), speaking the truth (<i class="calibre4">satya</i>), celibacy (<i class="calibre4">brahmacharya</i>), not taking what is not willingly offered
						(<i class="calibre4">asteya</i>), and detachment from people,
					places, and things (<i class="calibre4">aparigraha</i>). The most
					important of these vows is the practice of ahimsa, which extends beyond avoiding
					violence against human beings to encompass all animals, including the smallest
					organisms found in water or air. The other four Great Vows equip the monk or nun
					to follow the life of a wandering mendicant, dedicated to preaching, fasting,
					worship, and study.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-denial is central to Jainism. It is said within the faith that Mahavira
					himself went naked, having been so deep in thought at the start of his
					wanderings that he failed to notice when his robe snagged on a thorn bush and
					was pulled off. But in the 4th century CE, long after Mahivira’s death,
					the extent to which self-denial should be practiced caused a schism in Jainism
					between the Shvetambara (“white-clad”) and Digambara
					(“sky-clad”) sects. Shvetambara monks believe that detachment and
					purity are mental qualities that are unimpeded by wearing a simple robe.
					However, Digambara monks go naked, believing that the wearing of clothes
					indicates that a person is not completely detached from sexual feelings and
					false notions of modesty. Digambara monks may not even carry alms bowls, but
					must receive food in their cupped hands. Digambaras also believe that liberation
					from rebirth is not possible for women until they have first been reborn as a
					man.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-422"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00348.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Images of the jinas</span> or tirthankaras,

					are similar: renouncing violence, vowing not to lie or to steal, embracing
					chaste sexual behavior, and avoiding attachment to material things. All Jains
					are strictly vegetarian, in line with the vow of nonviolence, and must not do
					work that involves the destruction of life. Some Jains will only use flowers
					that have already fallen from the plant in their worship, arguing that to cut a
					living flower is an act of violence. Lay Jains may marry, but are expected to
					uphold the highest standards of behavior. In this, as in all things, Jains
					follow the path of the Three Jewels: right faith, right knowledge, and right
					conduct.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes there is said to be a fourth jewel, right penance: atonement for
					sins is important in Jainism. At the annual festival of Samvatsari, which
					follows an eight-day period of fasting and abstinence in the monsoon season, a
					full confession is made to family and friends of the sins of the past year, and
					vows are taken not to carry grudges into the new year. Meditation is important,
					too, and Jain daily rituals include 48-minute sessions of meditation, in which
					the aim is to be at one with the universe, and to forgive and be forgiven for
					all transgressions. (Forty-eight minutes&mdash;one-thirtieth of aday&mdash;is
					a <i class="calibre4">mahurta</i>, a standard unit of time in India
					often used for ritual purposes.)</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Jain virtues are: service to others, attention to religious study,
					disengagement from passion, and politeness and humility. Particular merit is
					gained by donating food to monks and nuns. All of these practices combine with
					the self-denial required by even laypersons’ vows to reduce the karma
					(consequences of past deeds) which, the Jains believe, accumulates on the soul
					as a kind of physical substance. All karma, both good and bad, must be removed
					to achieve liberation. The idea is to progress gradually along the path of
					spiritual enlightenment, earning merit little by little, life by life. One of
					the Jain holy texts, the <i class="calibre4">Tattvartha Sutra</i>,
					sets out a sequence of 14 stages through which the soul must pass to achieve
					liberation: the first stage is called <i class="calibre4">mithyadrishti</i>, in which the soul is in a spiritual slumber; the
					final, 14th, stage is <i class="calibre4">ayoga-kevali</i>, which is
					populated by souls known as <i class="calibre4">siddhas</i>, who have
					achieved full spiritual liberation. This final stage is beyond the reach of lay
					Jains.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"I ask pardon of all living creatures. May all of them pardon me. May I

				to systematically explore the notion of goodness and whether moral superiority is a
				divine privilege or is inherent in humankind and can be cultivated.</p><p class="calibre11">Born in the 6th century BCE in Qufu, in modern China’s Shandong Province,
				Confucius was one of a new breed of scholars&mdash;in effect, the first civil
				servants&mdash;who became advisors to the Chinese court, rising from the middle
				classes to positions of power and influence on the strength of their own merit
				rather than through inheritance. In the rigidly class-stratified society of the day,
				this presented an anomaly, and it is this anomaly that lies at the heart of
				Confucius’s thought.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The rulers of the reigning Zhou dynasty believed that they were given their
				authority directly by the gods, under the Mandate of Heaven, and that the quality of
					<i class="calibre4">ren</i> (or <i class="calibre4">jen</i>)&mdash;humaneness&mdash;was an attribute of the ruling
				classes. Confucius, too, saw heaven as the source of moral order, but he argued that
				the blessing of heaven was open to all, and that the quality of <i class="calibre4">ren</i> could be acquired by anyone. It is in fact the duty
				of everyone to cultivate the attributes that make up <i class="calibre4">ren</i>&mdash;seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and
				kindness. To practice these virtues is to uphold the will of heaven.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i class="calibre4">Analects</i>&mdash;sayings and teachings of
				Confucius collected by his pupils&mdash;established a new philosophy of morality in
				which the superior man, or <i class="calibre4">junzi</i> (literally
				gentleman), devotes himself to the acquisition of <i class="calibre4">ren</i> for its own sake&mdash;he learns for learning’s sake,
				and is good for goodness’ sake. Asked by a student to explain the rules to be
				followed by the seeker of <i class="calibre4">ren</i>, Confucius replied,
				“One should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing
				improper, do nothing improper.”</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Confucius was concerned not simply with self-cultivation, but with the relations
				between people, and the proper way to behave in a family, a community, and a larger
				society. Confucius himself admitted students of all classes as his disciples, and
				fundamentally believed that virtue lay in self-cultivation rather than noble birth.
				Because of the rigidity of the prevailing hierarchy in China’s feudal
				society, Confucius had to find a way to promote individual virtue without calling
				for a simple meritocracy. He did so by arguing that the virtuous man accepts and
				understands his place in the social order, and uses his virtue to fulfill his
				allotted role rather than to transcend it. “The superior man,” he
				said, “does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire
				to go beyond this.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-429"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000164.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its

					in an arbitrary and unjust way, they should lead by example, and that treating
					the people with generosity and kindness would encourage virtue, loyalty, and
					right behavior. However, in order to govern others, it is necessary first to
					govern oneself. For Confucius, a humane ruler was defined by his practice of
						<i class="calibre4">ren</i>; without it, he might forfeit the
					Mandate of Heaven. In many ways Confucius’s idea of the perfect ruler
					echoes Laozi’s concept of the <i class="calibre4">dao</i>: the
					less the ruler does, the more is achieved. The ruler is the stable center around
					which the activity of the kingdom revolves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rulers who took this advice to heart also found themselves in need of advisors
					and civil servants whose skill and trustworthiness were founded in the Confucian
					concepts of virtuous behavior; in 136 BCE the Han dynasty introduced new
					competitive examinations for the imperial civil service based on meritocratic
					Confucian ideals. In turn the Chinese concept of heaven acquired a distinctly
					bureaucratic tone, and by the time of the Song dynasty (960&ndash;1279 CE),
					heaven was seen as a mirror image of the court of the Chinese emperor, with its
					own emperor and a vast celestial civil service of lesser deities.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his many references to heaven, Confucius did not believe his moral
					precepts were derived from the gods; instead he found them already existing in
					the human heart and mind. To this extent, Confucianism is more a humanistic
					system of moral philosophy than it is a religion; although even today, with some
					5&ndash;6 million followers, the distinction between the two remains blurred.
					In Chinese popular religion, Confucius has joined the crowded pantheon of gods,
					but many of his followers revere him simply as a great teacher and
					thinker.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-432"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-433" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Building on ritual</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The adoption of Confucianism as a religion stems largely from the fact that
					Confucius upheld the duty to practice rites and ceremonies that honored
					ancestors. This he saw as part of a wider imperative of loyalty to family and
					friends, and respect for elders&mdash;which Confucius defined in what he called
					the Five Constant Relationships (see left). Reciprocity plays a key role in
					these relationships, for Confucianism, at its heart, embodies the Golden
					Rule: do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.
					Confucius believed that by honoring ties of love, loyalty, ritual, and
					tradition, virtuous thought, virtuous action, and respect, not only could
					everybody be good, but society would be bound together in a positive and
					right-thinking way.By revering the ancestors and performing the correct
					rites in their honor, humans could maintain a state of harmony between this
					world and heaven. At the family level, such rites were an echo of those in which
					the emperors made sacrifices to their ancestors and confirmed the Mandate of
					Heaven under which they ruled. Filial piety remains one of the most important

					incorporated elements of Daoism and Buddhism into Confucianism, creating an
					enduring religion that is also known as Neo-Confucianism. Confucius was not the
					first Chinese sage to contemplate the eternal truths, and Confucius himself
					claimed to have invented nothing, but merely to have studied the ideas of
					earlier thinkers, gathering them together in five books, known as the Five
					Classics. Under the Western Zhou dynasty, from 1050 to 771 BCE, scholars were
					highly valued at court, and in the 7th century BCE the so-called Hundred Schools
					of Thought emerged. Confucius lived in a time of philosophical ferment, but also
					of social change, as the power of the Zhou emperors declined and the whole
					social order seemed to be under threat. His focus on order and harmony emerged
					from a genuine concern about potential societal breakdown. The emperors of later
					dynasties such as the Han (206 BCE&ndash;220 CE), the Song (960&ndash;1279 CE)
					and the Ming (1368&ndash;1644 CE) recognized the value of Confucian ideals in
					maintaining social order, and Confucianism became the Chinese state religion. It
					was also a profound influence on daily life and thought into the 20th century,
					and was attacked during the Cultural Revolution for its social conservatism, but
					in recent years a New Confucianism has emerged in China, blending Confucian
					ideas with modern Chinese thinking and Western philosophy. Although Confucius
					built his philosophy on existing concepts and practices, he was remarkable for
					his insistence that human beings are naturally good&mdash;only needing to be
					taught and encouraged, to be virtuous&mdash;and that this goodness is not
					confined to the aristocracy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-436"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00305.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Respect for elders</span> and ancestors is a

				birth to a divine son in the Diktaean cave above Psychro. This cave became her
				holiest shrine and no one, god or man, was permitted to enter. Once a year a fiery

				would often provide more satisfactory responses.</p><p class="calibre11">Oracles could be consulted on any aspect of life, from personal matters, such as
				love and marriage, to affairs of state. Prophecies could also be used for political
				ends: Alexander the Great visited the oracle of the Egyptian god Amun after
				conquering Egypt in 332 BCE, and had his rule legitimized when the oracle recognized
				him as the “son of Amun.” However, the number of oracles was limited,
				and this, combined with the fact that substantial offerings were often advisable,
				meant that personalized access to the gods became the province of the rich and
				powerful. A popular alternative was the service offered by seers or soothsayers,
				who, unlike the oracles, were prepared to travel&mdash;particularly useful for
				Greek armies on the move. These seers interpreted signs from the gods by methods
				such as dream analysis, inferring meaning from chance events, observation of birds,
				and deducing omens from animal sacrifice.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"The Sibyl, with raving lips… reaches over a thousand years with her

				mortals and reflected their history. However, while the Greeks saw their gods as
				remote controllers of the universe, the Romans considered them to be an intrinsic
				part of their lives, and to have a direct influence on every aspect of existence.
				They believed that divine aid was key to successful governance, and so worship,
				ritual, and sacrifice were incorporated into public ceremonies in order to ensure
				the cooperation of the gods. Public ceremonies also helped to strengthen the
				authority of the regime, and religious festivals, often involving public holidays
				and games, contributed to political unity. Religious and state life were
				interdependent, with priests forming a part of the political elite and leaders
				expected to perform religious duties. In time, individual rulers became associated,
				during their lifetime, with a particular god; some eventually became regarded
					<i class="calibre4">as</i> gods&mdash;either by being deified after
				death or even achieving divine status while they were still alive.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-444"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-445" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cults and household gods</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Various cults coexisted with the religion of the state.

					most Roman citizens, however, the local and household gods, the lares and
					penates, were the ones associated with everyday life. They were so interested in
					human affairs that their presence was everywhere; they were open to negotiation,
					and prayers to them often took the form of bargains: “I give so
					that you will give.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation of religion for the Romans was the family. The
					paterfamilias&mdash;head of the family&mdash;was the spiritual leader and
					moral authority, who held legal rights over the property of the family and was
					responsible for its members in society. The home was sacred to the Romans, and
					the heart of the home was the hearth. The spirit of the head of the household
					presided over all the household gods, including the penates, the deities of the
					store cupboard, to whom a portion of each meal was offered on the flames of the
					hearth.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"At Rome as elsewhere, in order to understand the society of the gods, we

					scope was broader than that of the household penates, and shrines to the
					neighborhood lares were often placed at crossroads, a symbol of home in its
					wider sense. The lares are thought to have evolved from earlier cults of
					hero-ancestors, or the spirits of ancestors buried in farmland, with their role
					as protectors of agriculture and livestock. In the Roman Republic, they came to
					be the guardians of businesses, transport, and communication. Lares were closely
					associated with local communities and everyday public life, and were very much
					gods of the plebians (such as soldiers, seafarers, farmers, and traders), rather
					than of the ruling class of patricians, complementing the major deities of the

				that it is not so much a religion as a Japanese way of life, because it is so
				intrinsically linked to the topography of the land and its history and traditions.
				Its origins can be traced to prehistoric times in Japan, when animist beliefs, with
				their respect for nature and natural phenomena, prevailed.</p><p class="calibre11">As the universal belief system of an isolated island nation, Shinto had no need to
				define itself until it was challenged by the arrival of a rival religion, Buddhism,
				in the 6th century CE. The traditional Japanese beliefs lacked complex intellectual
				doctrines, allowing Buddhism and also Confucianism to become influential in Japanese
				theology and philosophy. In response, the Japanese imperial court consolidated
				Japan’s native beliefs with a name&mdash;Shinto&mdash;and in the early 8th
				century, at the request of the Empress Gemmei, the great Shinto texts such as the
				Kojiki (“Record of Ancient Matters”) and Nihon Shoki
				(“Continuing Chronicles of Japan”) were compiled.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;These books recorded the oral traditions of Japanese history and myth, alongside
				the lineage of the Japanese emperors, said to be descended from the gods. They also
				defined a body of ritual that has remained key to Shinto ever since&mdash;perhaps
				more so than belief. Shinto still permeates every aspect of Japanese life, and its
				rituals, in which purification plays a key role, are performed in both spiritual and
				secular situations&mdash;for example, to bring success and good fortune to sporting
				events, new car assembly lines, or construction projects. During these rituals,
				which carry a great weight of tradition, sacred beings called kami are prayed to and
				honored. The word Shinto literally means “Way of the Divine Beings,”
				and Shinto is known in modern Japanese as <i class="calibre4">Kami no
					michi</i>, the “Way of the Kami.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-449"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00311.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Great Japan is the Land of the Gods.

					as god, spirit, or soul. However, in Shinto belief, the term designates not only
					a vast range of divinities and spirit beings, but also the spiritual energy or
					essence that is found in everything, and which defines that thing: kami are
					present, for example, as essences of natural phenomena (such as storms and
					earthquakes) and the geographical environment (rivers, trees, and waterfalls,
					for example). Mountains, especially Mount Fuji, are held to be particularly
					sacred.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As entities, kami include gods, goddesses, and the souls or spirits of family
					ancestors (ujigami) and other exceptional human beings. Shinto teaches that
					these kami occupy the same material world as people, rather than existing on a
					supernatural plane. They respond to prayer and can influence events. However,
					unlike the divine beings in many other religious traditions, kami, although
					godlike, are not omnipotent: they have limitations and are fallible. However,
					not all kami are good&mdash;some can be evil or demonic. But in their more
					benign aspect, they possess sincerity and a will to truth, or <i class="calibre4">makoto</i>, and maintain harmony in the universe
					through the creative potency known as <i class="calibre4">musubi</i>.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-451" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Shinto’s creator gods</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to the Kojiki, at the creation of the universe, the first three kami
					emerged. These included the Kamimusubi (divine/ high generative force kami),
					which was too abstract to be a focus of worship. However, after several
					generations of formless kami, the major Shinto gods appear: Izanagi and Izanami,
					who created the world, or “invited it into being.” Many Shinto
					myths are devoted to them and to the activities of their offspring, Susanoo, the
					storm god, Tsukuyomi, the moon god, and Amaterasu, the sun goddess.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The kami represent the creators of Japan, the very land itself (as the spirits
					of its natural features and natural forces), and those who have gone before&mdash;Japanese ancestors. The ritual worship of these sacred beings therefore
					confirms a powerful connection to Japanese history and tradition.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-452"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00222.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Shinto priests</span> may be male or female;

					and making offerings at shrines and temples. On entering a shrine, a ritual of
					purification is performed. These rituals are central to Shinto, for which ideas
					of purity and impurity are very important. Shinto does not have a concept of
					original sin, but rather believes that human beings are born pure, only becoming
					tainted by impurity later. The sources of impurity are sin (acts within our
					control) and pollution (things beyond our control, such as disease or contact
					with death). These impurities, or <i class="calibre4">tsumi</i>, need
					to be ritually purified. Purification rituals may take a variety of forms, but
					ceremonial hand washing and mouth washing sequences are common to most.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Small shrines known as <i class="calibre4">kami-dona</i> are found
					in many Japanese homes, consisting of a small shelf displaying objects used to
					honor the ancestors and other kami. Public temples and shrines may be as large
					as a village, or as small as a beehive. They are remarkable for their
					simplicity; many originated as sacred areas around natural objects such as
					trees, ponds, or rocks. Each Shinto temple has a gateless entrance called a
					torii, which usually consists of a pair of uprights and a crossbar. Typically,
					every temple also has a wall where worshippers may post wooden votive tablets
					that bear a message to the kami, asking, for example, for success in passing an
					exam or help in finding a suitable marriage partner.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual prayers at the worship hall of a Shinto shrine follow a set
					four-step process, after the initial ritual cleansing. First, money is put into
					an offering box. Next, the worshipper makes two deep bows before the shrine,
					then claps their hands twice, and finally, after concluding prayers, makes one
					last deep bow. In addition to prayer and offerings at shrines, Shinto has
					celebratory festivals known as <i class="calibre4">matsuri</i>, at
					which the kami are honored and important points in the agricultural year are
					marked, such as rice-planting in April. Correctly performed, Shinto followers
					believe that these rituals enable <i class="calibre4">wa</i>, the
					positive harmony that helps to purify the world and keeps it running
					smoothly.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"As you have blessed the ruler’s reign… so I bow down my neck

					Amaterasu (the first emperor, Jimmu, who took power in 660 BCE, was said to be
					her great-great-great-grandson), and this became official doctrine in the 7th
					and 8th centuries. The codifiying of Shinto at this time not only eliminated
					influences from Buddhism, but also placed an emphasis on the superior status of
					the Japanese people in general. This was used, in turn, as the rationale for
					Japan’s political and military ambitions, especially after the Meiji
					Restoration, which returned imperial rule to Japan in the 19th century.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and his court were obliged to carry out ceremonies to ensure that
					the kami watched over Japan and secured its success, a tradition that was
					maintained until the end of World War II. Shinto’s standing in Japan was
					transformed, however, after the country lost the war and was forced to make
					concessions to the Allies. Viewed by the occupying US forces as too militaristic
					and nationalistic, Shinto was disestablished in 1946, ceasing to be the official
					state religion. In the same year, Emperor Hirohito renounced his claim to
					divinity. But while today the emperor is no longer formally regarded as divine,
					the imperial ceremonies are still viewed as important. Shinto’s strong
					emphasis on order and harmony; its regard for social norms, ritual, and
					tradition; and its respect for the emperor means that Shinto has maintained its
					role as the bedrock of conservative Japanese society.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Man by nature is inherently good, and the world in which he lives is good.

					begs Izanagi not to look at her, but he lights a torch and discovers her rotting
					body crawling with maggots. He flees to the land of the living and bathes in the
					sea to purify himself. The message of the contaminating influence of the dead is
					clear: Shinto regards death as the ultimate impurity. For this reason, Shinto

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-173"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Alhough Hinduism could arguably be called the oldest of living
				religions, the term itself is a relatively modern one, which gives a misleading
				impression of a unified faith with a single set of beliefs and practices. Hinduism
				can trace its origins to the Iron Age, but it is in fact more a convenient umbrella
				term covering most of the indigenous religions of the Indian subcontinent. Although
				these religions share some characteristics, they vary greatly in practice and
				encompass a wide range of different traditions. In some of these traditions, the
				faith has remained substantially unchanged since the earliest times.</p><p class="calibre11">While more than three-quarters of the population of India identify themselves as
				“Hindu,” today the definition of such a range of loosely connected
				faiths is as much sociopolitical as religious. The word “Hindu” (which
				shares its roots with the name of the River Indus, and of India) essentially means
				“Indian.” It distinguishes the native religions from those introduced
				to the country, such as Islam, and newer breakaway religions such as Jainism and
				Buddhism.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of defining Hinduism was summed up in an Indian High Court ruling
				in 1995: “… the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does
				not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe
				in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or
				performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features
				of any religion or creed. It may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing
				more.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-463"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000228.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-464" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Common beliefs</h2></div><p class="calibre14">However, certain ideas have remained central to virtually all strands of
					Hinduism, in particular the notion of samsara (the cycle of birth and rebirth of
					the atman, the soul) and the associated belief in the possibility of moksha, or
					release from this endless cycle. The key to achieving moksha is encapsulated in
					the word dharma, which is variously translated as “virtue,”
					“natural law,” “right living,” or simply
					“appropriateness.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, this is subject to a number of interpretations, but three main
					ways of achieving moksha have emerged, collectively known as the <i class="calibre4">marga</i>. These are <i class="calibre4">jnana-marga</i> (knowledge or insight), <i class="calibre4">karma-</i><i class="calibre4">marga</i> (appropriate action or right behavior),
					and <i class="calibre4">bhakti-marga</i> (devotion to the gods). The
					marga allow scope for a very wide range of religious practices to suit the
					different traditions, including a variety of rituals, meditation, yoga, and
					everyday worship (puja).</p></div><div id="calibre_link-465" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Concepts of god</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Virtually all branches of Hinduism accept that there is a supreme creator god,
					Brahma, who with Vishnu (the preserver), and Shiva (the destroyer) form a
					principal trinity, the Trimurti. However, many traditions have their own
					pantheons, or add local and personal deities to the mix. Confusingly, even the
					three major gods (and a lot of the minor ones) often appear in different guises.
					And so, while it may seem that Hinduism is a polytheistic religion, in many
					traditions, it is truer to say that adherents have a belief in a Lord God, who
					is complemented by the many minor deities who have special powers or carry
					particular responsibilities.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-466" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Sacred texts</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The different Hindu traditions have all been shaped by the four Vedas, a
					collection of ancient texts composed between 1200 and 900 BCE. The Brahmanas,
					commentaries on the Vedas, and later the Upanishads, provided a theoretical
					underpinning of the religion, while other texts&mdash;notably the two Indian
					epic poems, the <i class="calibre4">Mahabharata</i> and the <i class="calibre4">Ramayana</i>&mdash;expanded on history, mythology,
					religion, and philosophy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main characteristics of these Hindu traditions is tolerance. As a
					consequence of invasion, first by the Greeks under Alexander the Great, and
					later by Muslims and Christians, Hinduism has adapted and accepted some
					influences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while some reform movements emerged as a result of colonial
					influences, collectively labeling these connected religions as Hinduism gave
					them political clout and a focus for nationalism. This came to a head in the
					struggle for Indian independence in the 20th century, with Mohandas Gandhi
					famously advocating the Hindu weapons of nonviolent resistance and civil
					disobedience, and thereafter establishing an independent India in which all
					religions are not only tolerated but embraced.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				be called “Hinduism”; this is a modern Western term for the different
				religions and spiritual philosophies that have originated within the Indian
				subcontinent. Nevertheless, there are some basic features of these religious ideas
				and practices that are shared by the majority of Hindus, and it is these ideas that
				are grouped together under the umbrella of Hinduism. In practice, individual Hindus
				are free to choose which deities they worship, whether they do so at home or at a
				temple, and how often they take part in religious activities. But they share a
				common social and religious background that sets Hinduism apart from other belief
				systems, especially the monotheistic faiths.</p><p class="calibre11">In the same way as other religions, however, Hinduism seeks to explain how human
				life fits into the universal context. Its rituals and practices aim to address three
				levels of relationship&mdash;person to the divine; person to person; and person to
				him or herself&mdash;and how all of these relate in turn to the universal order of
				all things.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-468"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000181.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-469" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The eternal cosmic order</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Dharma, or “right way,” is a key term for expressing what
					Hinduism is about. In its original form, <i class="calibre4">sanatana
						dharma</i>, it may be translated from Sanskrit as “the eternal
					order of things,” truth, or reality. It expresses the idea that there is
					an underlying structure and meaning to the world; beneath the complexity and
					apparently random nature of events, there are some fundamental principles, and,
					underpinning these, a single, unchanging reality. These ideas are demonstrated
					in Hinduism in the hierarchy of gods and goddesses, each of whom expresses
					particular aspects of a single truth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an eternal order also has implications both for the individual and
					for society. Religion is effectively a way of understanding the place of
					humanity in the world. If the world is capable of being understood, and if it
					has a definite hierarchy or structure, then, by following that order, a person
					can live in harmony with the rest of society and with the universe as a whole. A
					key feature of the forms of religion that came together as Hinduism was that, in
					following this order, or dharma, a person may be required to perform rituals and
					make offerings to the gods (a form of sacrifice) that are thought necessary to
					maintain the sense of order.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that
						cannot be defined but is only to be experienced."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Radhakrishnan, The Bhagavad-Gita</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-470" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hindu ideas of time</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Hindu thought sees time as cyclical, with the universe already having moved
					through three great cycles. Each of these is said to have taken millions of
					years; each coming into being and then passing away.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of time as cyclical has an important consequence for religious
					thought. In the Western, linear, concept of time it is possible to think of
					everything as simply the product of something else that preceded it (the law of
					cause and effect), and it is therefore natural to wonder how the world began.
					This starting point is the only stage at which linear theories of time require
					some kind of input from outside the world itself: something has to have been
					responsible for setting the great train of cause and effect in motion at the
					beginning of time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, in Hindu thought, the ever-turning cycles of time are contrasted
					with an eternal and unchanging reality called Brahman, which exists in and
					through everything. Worldly time runs in cycles, but Brahman is timeless, the
					central force that keeps the cycles moving; it is the eternal reality that
					stands behind the process of creation and destruction that characterizes the
					world of human experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;If the great cycles of time are utterly dependent upon a timeless reality,
					then the right ordering of this changing world depends on awareness of that
					reality. This logic gives rise to the idea that one of the aims of religion is
					to understand and maintain the right ordering of the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-471"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00231.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">By performing rituals</span> in the prescribed

					years, there was a gradual influx of Aryan people from Central Asia into India.
					They brought with them their pantheon of gods, together with ideas that had
					parallels with those of the Ancient Greeks. The Aryans integrated themselves
					into the Indus Valley civilization of northern India, an ancient society known
					to have had its own religious traditions. There is strong evidence to suggest
					ritual bathing and worship of a great <a href="#calibre_link-119" class="calibre2">mother
						goddess</a>;
					other artifacts found include cremation urns and a seal depicting a horned,
					cross-legged deity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What took place was not a sudden or overwhelming change, but an intermingling
					of cultures. In terms of religion, what emerged was a tradition of sacrificial
					worship and ritual that found expression in the hymns of the first great
					collection of Hindu sacred literature, the Vedas. Within this new tradition,
					religious rituals and sacrifices were considered important, because they were
					thought to maintain the order of the cosmos. They also ensured that participants
					understood their place within that order and aligned themselves with it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifice was the primary rite of the Vedic tradition. It was a symbolic
					reenactment of the creation of the world and invoked deities who represented
					either universal qualities, or different features of the one, true reality. It
					was through this worship that a human fulfilled the most important of human
					tasks: forging a link to the divine. The ritual sacrifice was believed not only
					to provide a connection to the invisible realm, but also to establish the right
					ordering of things. In exchange for the sacrifice, a human might obtain
					protection from evil forces and accrue worldly benefits&mdash;such as better
					crops, good weather, robust health, and increased happiness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifice in this context simply meant making an offering to the gods,
					generally of food or drink. Fire was an essential part of any sacrificial
					ritual; fire was thought to exist in both heaven and earth, and thus have a
					divine power that could reach the gods.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vedic religion developed it became important that the sacrifices were
					performed by the right people (the Brahmin class) and in exactly the correct
					form. Details of the hymns to recite and actions to perform were carefully
					prescribed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrificial ground needed to be carefully prepared in a particular area as
					recommended by the ritualistic literature of the Vedas. The texts also specified
					the right wood needed to light the sacrificial fire, and the type of vessel
					required to hold the sacrificial offering (<i class="calibre4">huti</i>). Priests were expected to feed the sacrificial fire with
					offerings that might include ghee, cereal, fruit, or flowers, while chanting
					hymns from the Vedas.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice also needed to be performed on an auspicious date. It might be
					an offering to a particular god or goddess, but especially favored were Agni,
					Varuna, and Indra. Agni is the god of fire; his most important role is to
					manifest as the fire that burns on the sacrificial altar, destroying any demons
					who may attempt to disrupt the sacrifice. Varuna, the god of the sky, water, and
					celestial ocean, is also the guardian of <i class="calibre4">rta</i>
					&mdash;the cosmic order. He is the most prominent god of the Rig-Veda (the
					ritual book of the Vedas), responsible for separating night and day. He is
					believed to have created the waters, to prevent the rivers and oceans from
					overflowing, and to sustain the universe. Indra, the god of thunder, rain, and
					war, is known for his indulgence in <i class="calibre4">soma</i>, a
						<a href="#calibre_link-120" class="calibre2">sacrificial drink</a>; securing his goodwill is considered essential&mdash;he is
					locked in an eternal struggle against the forces of chaos and nonexistence, and
					it is his efforts that separate and support heaven and earth.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"We concentrate our minds upon the most radiant light of the Sun god, who

					and the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, the ancient Persian religion, which,
					like Hinduism, has its roots in very early Aryan cultures. Produced by pressing
					the juice from certain plants, it had intoxicating, possibly stimulant and
					hallucinogenic properties. The Rig-Veda describes it as “King
					Soma,” proclaiming: “We have drunk <i class="calibre4">soma</i> and become immortal: we have attained the light the Gods
					discovered.” It was prepared by priests as an offering to the gods in
					order that its energizing properties might assist and inspire them, although it
					seems likely that the priests themselves also partook.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly agaric (Amanita muscari) or psilocybin mushrooms may have been the source
					of <i class="calibre4">soma</i>; both are common inducers of trance
					in shamanic rituals. Marijuana and ephedra have also been proposed, the latter
					for its highly stimulating effects, consistent with descriptions of the god
					Indra downing soma as a preparation for battle.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-473" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Gods as aspects of order</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As Hinduism developed, the Aryan gods of the Vedas were joined and in many
					cases superseded by others. Minor Vedic gods were also elevated to much more
					prominent positions. Later Hindu literature contains a huge range of gods and
					goddesses, reflecting the blending of different traditions and different periods
					in the history of early Indian religion. From these gods there emerged a ruling
					triumvirate responsible for the existence, order, and destruction of the
					universe. These three gods&mdash;the Trimurti, or trinity&mdash;represent
					different aspects of reality: Brahma, the creator (not to be confused with
					Brahman); Vishnu, the protector and guardian of humanity; and Shiva, the
					destroyer, or, he who balances the forces of creation and destruction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The god Shiva is often represented, in images and in sculpture, as Shiva
					Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance. Shiva’s cosmic dance is shown as taking
					place within a circle of flames, which represents the ongoing process of birth
					and death. He has four arms: in his upper right hand he holds a drum, whose beat

					express a rhythmic balance between creation and destruction. His right foot is
					raised in the dance; his left treads on a demon, representing ignorance. This

					times, been based on the concept of dharma, extending the theory of the order
					and structure of the universe to include the correct ordering of human life and
					society. Historically, it is probable that, with the invasion of the
					light-skinned Aryans, a contrast was established between them and the
					darker-skinned native inhabitants of India, with the latter being treated as
					inferior. This led to a social system of four main classes, or varnas, a word
					meaning “color.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in Hinduism, this historical explanation is overlaid by a
					mythological account of the origin of the class system. In the Rig Veda there is
					a hymn to the Divine Person (Purusha) in which the body of a primal human being
					is sacrificed and divided up to create the four main varnas or classes of
					people: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra. Brahmins are members of the
					priestly class, who are said to have been created from Purusha’s mouth.
					Kshatriya is the military or administrative class, created from Purusha’s
					arms, while Vaishyas are members of the merchant class, formed from
					Purusha’s thighs. Shudra is the class of the common working people, hewn
					from Purusha’s feet. Because they all come from the single human reality,
					Purusha, they are interdependent and all have an essential part to play in the
					ordering of society. Their roles reflect their dharma&mdash;their divine
					duty.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the first three varnas are said to be twice-born in a sacred thread
					ritual, the <i class="calibre4">upanayana</i>, which marks the
					person’s acceptance of responsibility as a Hindu. The ritual is generally
					performed when, or soon after, a child turns eight, and has the effect of
					establishing his or her social position. Below the four varnas are those who
					find themselves completely outside the class system; formerly called outcasts
					they are now generally referred to as Dalits, meaning “the
					oppressed.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-144"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000093.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">According to Hindu tradition</span>, the four

							the primal man.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-476" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Class distinctions</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The four varnas are sometimes referred to as castes, but that is not strictly
					accurate. The Indian caste system is based on an equally ancient way of
					classifying people, broadly in terms of their occupation. There are a very large
					number of such classes, or <i class="calibre4">jati</i>, each with a
					corresponding social status. The two different approaches seem to have become
					entangled as Hindu society developed in the later Vedic period (from around 1000
					BCE), and the crucial differences between them became blurred.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the varna system the different social classes are all essential to to
					the right ordering of the world; since everyone comes from a single primal human
					figure, Purusha, everyone depends upon one another. Only the Brahmins were
					portrayed as a superior class&mdash;understandably, given that in the Vedic
					literature they are the ones empowered and authorized by tradition to,
					literally, maintain the sense of order in the universe. By contrast, the caste
					system was discriminatory, emphasizing separation as being necessary in order to
					avoid “pollution”: higher-caste people began to fear that they
					would be contaminated by contact with a low-status person. The caste system
					encouraged social fracturing, with rules forbidding people of different castes
					to mix together and especially to marry. This divisiveness was recognized in the
					Constitution of India, drawn up in 1948, which prohibited discrimination against
					lower castes, although popular prejudice has taken longer to eliminate.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"All living entities have different characteristics and duties that

					Mahavira, became critical of the formal and class-bound nature of Vedic worship.
					They welcomed followers from any class, and all were treated equally. These
					teachers argued for an emphasis on personal insight rather than inherited
					privilege. They also rejected the authority of the Vedas, and were therefore
					branded as unorthodox. But by around 500 BCE a definite shift in the way
					religion was viewed throughout Hindu society had taken place. Rather than being
					seen as a means of maintaining order, it now seemed to offer a way to escape the
					bondage of physical life by achieving a purely spiritual existence. Seeking
					liberation from, rather than alignment with, the established order became
					paramount. And in the centuries that followed, the Hindu tradition embraced the
					idea of personal devotion as a means of liberation, and worship became a matter
					more of personal engagement than simply the correct performance of sacrifice.
					Over time, personal forms of devotion and ritual developed, so much so that
					shrines became a common feature in people’s homes, and a Brahmin was no
					longer required to enable acts of devotion to take place.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-478" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Religion and society</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the Vedic period, religion was focused primarily on the individual finding
					his or her place within the universe, and within society, and living in the way
					that had been determined for that individual, according to the varnas; it had,
					therefore, both a personal and a social dimension, as well as an apparently
					rational system for prescribing how the personal and social interacted.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This early phase of Hinduism highlights an issue for all religion, namely
					whether it should be based mainly on the individual, or on society as a whole.
					Religions are embedded within society, and it is sometimes difficult to
					distinguish truly religious ideas from beliefs and attitudes that arise from the
					political or cultural milieu within which the religion developed. It is also the
					case that religious rules and traditions may be used by a ruling elite to
					maintain their own position.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even posing the question of whether religion should focus on the individual or
					society is problematic, for it implies that a personal experience of religion is

						<i class="calibre4">sruti</i> and <i class="calibre4">smriti</i>. The term <i class="calibre4">sruti</i>, which
					means “that which is heard,” is used to describe Vedic literature,
					which was heard by priests and scholars through the process of revelation, or of
					the realization of undoubted truth. This canonical knowledge was then passed
					down via the oral tradition from one generation of Brahmins to the next.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four collections of Vedic hymns, composed over a period of 1,000
					years. The first, thought to date back to 1200 BCE, is the Rig-Veda. Associated
					with these, and also <i class="calibre4">sruti</i>, are the
					Brahmanas, which provide instructions about the performance of ritual; the
					Aranyakas, which outline discussions on meditation and ritual; and the
					Upanishads, which provide philosophical interpretations. Vedic <i class="calibre4">sruti</i> literature is the ultimate authority for
					Hindus.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The term <i class="calibre4">smriti</i>, which translates as
					“that which is remembered” is used to describe the remaining Hindu
					literature, notably the great epic poems, the <i class="calibre4">Mahabharata</i> and the <i class="calibre4">Ramayana</i>.
					While not having the same status as <i class="calibre4">sruti</i>,
					because they are not thought to be divinely inspired, these texts are
					nonetheless important because they are open to interpretation. This significant
					strand of Indian literature is still hugely influential and includes the

				which had been composed by the 6th century BCE. They record the highest level of
				teachings, reserved for the finely trained, meditative minds of Hindu sages or
				gurus. Their central concern is the nature of the self; in effect they argue that to
				understand the self is to understand everything.</p><p class="calibre11">Western philosophy has traditionally taken two positions on the nature of the
				self. For the school known as dualist, the self is nonphysical and distinct from the
				body. Whether it is called the soul or the mind, it is the thinking and feeling
				aspect of what we are&mdash;the “I” that experiences the world. It is
				this “I” that absorbs sensory data and makes sense of it. Materialists
				(or physicalists), on the other hand, argue that only physical things exist,
				therefore the self is no more than a way of describing the activity of the
				brain.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Within Hinduism, however, the Upanishads explored a view that differs from both of
				these Western approaches. In these texts, the self is described as having three
				parts: a material body; a more subtle body, which is made up of thoughts, feelings,
				and experiences; and a pure consciousness, called the atman. The atman, it is
				claimed, is identical with the absolute, impersonal reality, Brahman. Therefore,
				although we may experience ourselves as separate, small, and vulnerable individuals,
				our true selves are actually at one with the fundamental reality of the
				universe.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-487"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00237.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-488" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The self as nothing</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Upanishads express the idea of atman by way of dialogues and images. One
					of the most famous is from the Chandogya Upanishad. It is a dialogue between the
					sage Uddalaka Aruni and his son, Svetaketu. The sage asks the boy to bring and
					cut open a fig. When his father asks him what he sees inside it, the son
					replies, “seeds.” The sage then asks his son to divide one of
					those seeds, and describe what he sees inside that. The answer is
					“nothing.” The sage then points out that the whole great fig tree
					is made of just such “nothingness.” That is its essence, its soul,
					its reality. And, the dialogue concludes, “That is you,
					Svetaketu!”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement, “That is you!” (in Sanskrit, “<i class="calibre4">Tat tvam asi!</i>”), is probably the most famous
					in all Hindu philosophy. It rests on the idea that analysis of any apparently
					solid object will eventually arrive at an invisible essence, present everywhere,
					which is Brahman. This applies to everything, from a fig to the human self.
					Beyond the physical and mental aspects of the self, Hinduism says there is
					something greater, the atman, which can be nothing other than Brahman, the
					single, absolute reality. There is no distinction between us and this ultimate
					divine reality.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-489"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00191.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Microscopy has helped science</span> to

					attempts to give us some sense of what Brahman might be like. A bowl of water is
					brought and the son is asked to taste the liquid from different parts of the
					bowl. It tastes pure throughout. Salt is then dissolved in the water. Now,
					although the appearance remains the same, all of the water tastes of salt. In
					the same way, Brahman, the absolute reality, is unseen but present
					everywhere.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mundaka Upanishad uses a different image for Brahman. Just as thousands of
					sparks fly from a large fire and then fall back into it, so innumerable beings
					are created from Brahman, “the imperishable,” or “Great
					One,” which is described as unborn, breathless, mindless, and pure&mdash;but bringing forth breath, mind, and all the senses. “Its heart
					is the whole world. Truly, this is the Inner Self of all.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In this understanding, the way we experience the world through the senses,
					viewing it as consisting of objects separate from ourselves, is not the absolute
					truth; there is a reality that underlies and sustains everything, which is
					invisible and within our innermost self.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-490"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000274.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">An endless cycle of lives</span> is what lies

					sacrifices to the gods maintained the sense of order in the universe. The
					Upanishads internalized that process. They claimed that reality is to be found
					as an absolutely simple, still point, deep within the self. And that reality is
					universal, not individual. Just as making a sacrifice in the correct way was
					thought to align the self with the universal order, so being aware of Brahman as
					the true self is to align yourself with reality itself.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hindus believe that karma (actions) produce consequences&mdash;both good and
					bad&mdash;not just in the external world, but also for the person who performs
					them. Hinduism developed an idea of reincarnation in which the self takes on a
					succession of bodies over the course of many lifetimes. The form each life takes
					is determined by karma from the previous life. However, knowledge that
					“atman is Brahman” can release a person from the constant cycle of
					birth, death, and rebirth (which is known as samsara). Karma is generated by the
					actions of the physical body and the subtle mental body (such as an
					individual’s thoughts and feelings), but the person who is aware of the
					atman, and therefore of Brahman, residing deep within the self, will transcend
					the level of the two bodies (physical and subtle mental) at which karma
					operates.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hindus hope that, by generating good karma, they will improve their
					prospects in future lives, there is always the threat that bad karma will lead
					to them being reborn into a lower caste, or as an animal. However, this is not
					as important as it first appears, because moving on to another life (good or
					bad) is not viewed as a final goal in Hinduism. Unlike in monotheistic
					religions, in which the prospect of life beyond death is a promise to be
					welcomed, in Hinduism the aim is to be released from the suffering that
					inevitably arises from living and dying in one life after another.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"When many candles are kindled from another, it is the same flame that

					scientific analysis of matter, but presented in the language of a prescientific
					age. Today, the equivalent would be to say that everything is comprised of
					subatomic particles, energy, and the fundamental forces.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the purpose and implication of the Upanishadic dialogues and modern
					science are quite different. In the Upanishads, reasoned argument is not an end
					in itself, but a means of leading a person to an intuition that goes beyond
					words. The logic of the argument for the identity of atman and Brahman
					represents no more than the starting point for understanding them. The aim of
					the Upanishads’ teachings is to encourage students to internalize and
					meditate on the arguments until the reality that they suggest is directly
					experienced&mdash;in a way that goes beyond reason and language. This wordless
					awareness is said to produce a state of bliss (<i class="calibre4">ananda</i>).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that a self formed by sense experience and reason alone
					would suffice for the purposes of a human life. This was challenged by the sages
					who produced the dialogues of the Upanishads. The Katha Upanishad uses a chariot
					as an analogy of the self. The senses are the chariot’s horses and the
					mind is its driver. But riding in the chariot is the atman. The implication of
					this image is that, for someone whose whole awareness is limited to reason and
					sense experience, the onward rush of the chariot is without purpose, since it
					lacks a passenger who is making the journey. That is what the intuition of the
					atman restores.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hinduism does not see gaining consciousness of the atman as easy. It can occur
					only after other possible identities have been examined and discarded as
					inadequate. It is not a fact to be learned, but an intuition that can gradually
					inform a person’s conscious awareness.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"Concealed in the heart of all beings is the Atman, the Spirit, the Self;

					body, the possibility of surviving death and living on in another form becomes
					logically possible. Most Western religions see each individual soul as being
					created at a particular point in time, but capable of living on indefinitely
					following the death of the body. Hindu thought sees the self as timeless, having
					no beginning, and identified with the single, undifferentiated reality. This
					self takes on physical form in a succession of lives, which is the idea of
					reincarnation. For Western monotheistic religions, the issue is whether the soul
					is genuinely separable from the body, and how, if separated, it might maintain
					its identity. For Hindus, the issue is to intuitively grasp that this self and
					this life are only a part of something much larger, and that the self is one
					with the fundamental reality of the universe.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-36" class="calibre2">Animism in early societies</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre2">Man and the cosmos</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-55" class="calibre2">Seeing with pure consciousness</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-105" class="calibre2">Man as a manifestation of God</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-97" class="calibre2">Mystical experience in Christianity</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-9" class="calibre2">Sufism and the mystic tradition</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				and correct ways of living that might secure these aims. Hinduism proposes that life
				has several main goals: dharma (right living); the linked concepts of <i class="calibre4">artha</i> (wealth) and <i class="calibre4">kama</i> (pleasure); and moksha (liberation). The pursuit of dharma&mdash;living as duty obliges&mdash;keeps a person on the righteous path. The
				search for wealth and pleasure leads people to learn valuable lessons, as well as
				producing children, supporting the family, and being in a position to give alms. The
				final goal, moksha, is a liberation from the concerns and things of the earthly
				world.</p><p class="calibre11">By the 6th century BCE two very different traditions in Indian religion existed.
				Most people in India followed the Vedic tradition, offering sacrifices to the gods
				and hoping for a life of wealth and pleasure, moderated by the moral and social
				principles encoded in dharma. However, others had become attracted to a different
				lifestyle&mdash;that of the wandering ascetic, committed to serious physical and
				mental discipline in order to achieve spiritual liberation, and shunning both wealth
				and pleasure. This ascetic tradition, known as <i class="calibre4">shramana</i> (a Sanskrit word that translates as something like
				“to work at austerity”) was very influential in the development of
				both Buddhism and Jainism. The Dharma Sutras&mdash;sacred texts on the rules of
				correct behavior&mdash;suggested that a person who had studied dharma (virtue or
				right living) was essentially faced with three possible paths: the continued study
				of the Vedic texts as the principal goal in life; a life seeking wealth and
				pleasure; or the renunciation of everything in order to become an ascetic. The last
				choice was not an uncommon one in Hindu society at this time; the most famous
				example is that of Buddha, who abandoned his privileged life as Prince Siddhartha
				Gautama, leaving his wife and baby son in order to become a wandering
				teacher.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the position of the followers of the <i class="calibre4">shramana</i> tradition&mdash;that asceticism was more spiritually
				valuable than the seeking of <i class="calibre4">artha</i> (wealth) and
					<i class="calibre4">kama</i> (pleasure)&mdash;placed them in
				opposition to Vedic tradition. For around a thousand years, the Vedas had been used
				to teach that seeking material comfort and personal fulfillment were noble goals in
				life, if correctly pursued. So, was it necessary to choose between such radically
				different paths? Or might it be possible for a person to enjoy the benefits of all
				four traditional goals?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-494"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00046.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-495" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Having it all</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In about the 5th century BCE, further commentaries on dharma known as shastras
					offered a new approach: instead of making one final choice, a person might work
					toward different goals in succession, as they moved through four stages of life,
					or <i class="calibre4">ashramas</i>: student, house-holder, retiree,
					and renunciate, or ascetic. The correct aims in life, and correct behavior,
					would not only depend on the <a href="#calibre_link-144" class="calibre2">individual’s varna, or social class</a>, but would also vary with the stage reached in
					life.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Of Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Shudras, O Arjuna, the

The boy attends a <i class="calibre4">gurukula</i> (a school) where he studies Vedic
					literature with a guru, or teacher. He learns about dharma&mdash;right living
					&mdash;in an academic way, together with history, philosophy, law, literature,
					grammar, and rhetoric. Education traditionally continues until the age of around
					25 or 30, and during this stage, as well as showing respect to parents and
					teachers, students are expected to abstain from sexual activity, sublimating all
					their energy into their learning.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of his education, a Hindu man is expected to marry and have a
					family. This is the start of the <i class="calibre4">grihastha,</i>
					or householder, stage, during which every man is expected to be economically
					active, supporting not just his wife and children, but also elderly relatives.
					Traditional Indian households often include three or four generations who pool
					their income and use a single kitchen. This extended family tends to be
					organized on hierarchical lines, both for men and women. Householders are also
					expected to offer support to ascetics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The householder upholds the duties of his dharma and his varna (class), but,
					unlike in the other three stages, part of his duty is the pursuit of <i class="calibre4">artha</i> (wealth) and <i class="calibre4">kama</i> (desire), including sexual pleasure and procreation. To
					describe this stage of life as one in which wealth and pleasure are the primary
					goals, however, may give a distorted view of its obligations, for it involves
					caring for the extended family and offering hospitality.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-497"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00004.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">A man measures fabric</span> in his place of

					the arrival of the first grandson. Originally, it involved becoming a
					“forest dweller,” opting for a simple life of reflection into
					which a man could retire with his wife&mdash;although, at this stage, ceasing
					to have sex. Today it is generally a matter of letting go of overall
					responsibility for business and financial matters, allowing the next generation
					to take over, but also having time to study and offer wise advice.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Hindus never get beyond the retirement stage to reach that of the
					ascetic; they are only allowed to enter the fourth stage of life once they have
					fulfilled all their obligations to their family. This is the point at which the
					individual sets aside all worldly concerns and ties, and devotes his life to the

					concept that defines morality and lifestyle: <i class="calibre4">varnashrama-dharma</i>, literally the right ordering of life
					(dharma) according to one’s class (varna) and stage in life (<i class="calibre4">ashrama</i>). As a formula for prescribing how to live
					correctly, it is very different to those of other religions, where one set of
					moral commands applies equally to all. It is a moral system that recognizes
					flexibility and difference in people’s circumstances. It also aims to
					prevent pride in those of the higher classes, who must undergo a disciplined
					education in order to develop self-detachment and prepare them, mentally, to
					relinquish their worldly gains and responsibilities in later life. It confers
					value on the labors of the householder, recognizing that, both economically and
					practically, those in the second stage of life support everybody else. And it
					gives dignity to the elderly, with the final letting go of practical and
					domestic responsibilities seen as a positive opportunity for spiritual
					growth.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-500"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000287.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The various spiritual obligations</span> of

					throughout Hindu society, forming the background against which men lived out the
					four stages, with their moral and spiritual principles. In this traditional
					scenario, women do not feature in the first or last stages of a man’s
					life, and marriage is considered to be a contract between families, rather than
					a matter of romantic attachment. If a new wife is to be introduced to an
					extended family home, it is clearly problematic if she is not well suited to the
					man in terms of dharma, varna, or his <i class="calibre4">ashrama</i>. This explains the origins of certain Hindu social attitudes
					and traditions&mdash;for example, the arranged marriage&mdash;but many of
					these now clash with the outlook of some Hindus brought up in a more
					individualized and secular society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hinduism is to a large degree more about practice than belief, and it is
					closely bound up with ideas about age and class. Western concepts of individual
					rights and equality do not sit easily alongside some of the early Hindu
					teachings, and with the Westernization of attitudes, greater social mobility in
					modern India, and the practice of Hinduism in communities globally, it remains
					to be seen whether the the four stages will remain a viable model for Hindu
					life.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-502"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MORAL PRINCIPLES</h4><p class="intro">Hinduism has five broad moral principles: ahimsa (not killing), <i class="calibre4">satya</i> (speaking the truth), <i class="calibre4">asteya</i> (not stealing), <i class="calibre4">brahmacharya</i> (sexual continence), and <i class="calibre4">aparigraha</i> (not being avaricious). The way each of these is
					practiced depends on the stage of life. For instance, celibacy will not be
					practiced by householders, whose duty it is to have children. These principles
					define external morality, but there is also a tradition of inner cultivation to
					practice during all stages of life, which involves the pursuit of five
					qualities: cleanliness, contentment, pure concentration, group study, and
					devotion to God. The five qualities reflect the progression from the early Vedic
					tradition, based on ritual, to a religion of personal spiritual development and
					devotion, which developed many centuries later.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-135" class="calibre2">Self-denial leads to spiritual

				duty. It tells of a dialogue between Krishna (an incarnation of the supreme god
				Vishnu) and the warrior-prince Arjuna. Arjuna is about to go into battle against
				another branch of his family in a dispute over who should rule the kingdom. As a
				member of the <i class="calibre4">kshatriya</i> class (the military or
				ruling elite), it is his duty is to fight. Yet he despairs of killing some of those
				on the “other side”&mdash;his relatives or those whom he respects as
				great teachers.</p><p class="calibre11">In the opening section of the Gita, Arjuna says that he would rather give up the
				struggle over the kingdom than be involved in the slaughter. Not only does the idea
				of killing members of his family and his teachers go against his deepest
				inclinations, but he also fears that it will have negative consequences, creating
				bad karma for all involved (in Hinduism, killing a relative is thought to lead to
				the downfall of a family and rebirth in hell).</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Arjuna is caught between two apparently conflicting principles: should he do his
				duty as a member of the warrior class or avoid the disastrous karmic consequences of
				killing? Advice comes from his charioteer, who turns out to be none other than the
				god Krishna.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Krishna tells Arjuna that he should do his duty and fight. The act of killing
				would only create bad karma if it was done for the wrong reasons&mdash;out of
				hatred or greed, for example. The ideal is for the individual to do his or her duty,
				whatever it is and however much it goes against personal inclinations, but to do it
				with selfless motives. Not only will such action not cause harm, but it will be a
				step toward personal liberation.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Krishna argues that personal motives are what count when considering any type of
				action. He applauds the willingness to act dutifully out of selfless motives,
				setting aside any selfish preferences. Krishna then gives Arjuna a second reason for
				going into battle: the self is immortal and passes through a succession of
				incarnations, so no one is really killed. Only the body dies; the soul will live
				again in a different body.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to

					religions&mdash;in which not killing was the first precept and foundation of
					morality. This represented a departure from the Vedic class system and its
					traditional obligations. Arjuna’s dilemma reflects that clash of moral
					priorities, and Krishna’s advice is an attempt to maintain class

				physical and mental, which are used to help achieve spiritual insight and escape the
				limitations of the physical body.</p><p class="calibre11">Ideas about yoga are found in the 6th century BCE in the early philosophical Hindu
				texts known as the Upanishads, and there is a section on yoga in the ancient
				Sanskrit scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. The first systematic account of yoga is found
				in the Yoga Sutras. Some scholars attribute this text to the philosopher Patanjali,
				who lived in the 2nd century BCE. However, it is now generally agreed that it was
				written between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE by more than one author,
				and that it includes traditions and practices from earlier periods. The Yoga Sutras
				comprise a set of techniques to promote mental calmness and concentration, which are
				deemed necessary for gaining greater insight.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although originally devised for those who had taken an ascetic path, yoga was
				later developed as a set of practices that could be used by everybody. The physical
				postures and techniques for breath control are not an end in themselves. They aim to
				calm the mind and make it singular in its focus&mdash;single-pointed. The mind can
				only become calm once the senses have been controlled. It is only then that inner
				freedom and insight may arise.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-508"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00148.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-509" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A path to release</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to the Yoga Sutras, yoga enables the practitioner to avoid mental
					afflictions, such as ignorance, ego-centered views, and extremes of emotion. It
					also offers freedom from the “three poisons” of greed, anger, and
					delusion (a goal that Buddhism shares).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yoga Sutras set out the practice of yoga in eight steps. The first two are
					preparatory and show the context in which yoga becomes effective. First is the
					practice of a morality of restraint, particularly of ahimsa (not taking life).
					The second focuses on personal observances, such as the study of philosophical
					works and contemplation of a god in order to gain inspiration. The next three
					steps aim to control the body and senses: adopting physical postures (asanas) to
					control the body, controlling breathing, and withdrawing attention from the
					senses. Finally, there are three mental steps: concentrating the mind on a
					single object, meditating on that object, and arriving at a state of absorbed
					concentration. These steps are progressive, leading to the final release from a
					mundane awareness of self and world, with its mental afflictions, into a higher
					consciousness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, yoga is widely practiced as a healthful physical regime that also
					promotes inner calm. But it is important to remember that in the context of
					Hindu religion, the term yoga encompasses disciplines and practices not only of
					posture, but of morality, meditation, knowledge, and devotion, and that taken
					together, their aim is to release the true self or consciousness (<i class="calibre4">purusha</i>) from the entanglements of matter
						(<i class="calibre4">prakriti</i>), thereby restoring it to its
					natural condition. So, while many in the West think of yoga as a form of

				which could be visited by worshippers, and gradually, alongside the priestly rituals
				connected with birth, coming of age, marriage, and death, there developed a
				tradition of making personal acts of worship, or puja, to the deities that was open

					Hindu gods are frequently referred to according to the tasks they perform, such

					it through puja. However, puja is not always connected with personal requests
					and thanksgiving. It may be performed by a large gathering of people at a
					festival, such as the Durga Puja. This annual, nine-day celebration of the

				Hindu philosophy known as Vedanta (“the end of the Vedas”)developed in
				the 9th century. It sought to systematize and explain material found in the ancient
				scriptures of the Vedas, and to explore the nature of Brahman as discussed in the
				philosophical works, the Upanishads (the last section of the Vedas).</p><p class="calibre11">There are various branches of Vedanta, but the one established by Shankara is
				called Advaita (non-dualist) Vedanta. It states that there is only one
				reality, even if we may experience it in different ways. This non-dualist
				belief lies in contrast to later forms of Vedanta in which the deity assumes a
				personal role.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shankara argued that human reason is limited to the objects of sense
				experience: that is, it is not possible to get outside or beyond the senses
				to see the world as it really is. Even within the world of experience it is possible
				to be mistaken, because all sensory knowledge is ambiguous. To use Shankara’s
				example, a coil of rope may be mistaken for a snake, or vice versa. Further, a
				person may know it is possible to be fooled by what is seen, heard, or
				touched&mdash;but what if the whole enterprise of gathering information from the
				senses is itself a form of illusion?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-518"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000248.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-519" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An unknowable Brahman?</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Upanishads had taught that there is a single ultimate reality, Brahman,
					with which the innermost self, the atman, is identified. However, the problem is
					that Brahman is not an object of sense experience because it is not part of
					reality (as worldly objects are)&mdash;it is reality itself. Ordinary objects
					can be known because they are distinguished from one another by qualities that
					the senses can detect. Brahman, by contrast, because it has no physical
					attributes, cannot be grasped by rational interpretation of what is known
					through the senses.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should be made of the idea of a supreme being, or of the divinities
					used in religion? There appears to be a profound difference between what the
					Upanishads have to say in terms of philosophical argument and what is actually
					practiced in the Vedas, in terms of gods and goddesses that are addressed in
					worship. How, for example, can Brahman be both personal (knowable) and
					impersonal (unknowable) at the same time? How, if it is eternal and absolute,
					can it be described in any way?</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"The problem for the Advaitin is to solve how from the pure Brahman the

						<i class="calibre4">nirguna</i> Brahman (unqualified reality),
					known only through pure consciousness, and <i class="calibre4">saguna</i> Brahman (qualified reality), which is more like the
					traditional idea of a God who exists and acts in the world. Brahman remains the
					same reality, but can be known in different ways. One means of expressing this
					is to say that there is nothing in the world that is not Brahman&mdash;it is
					the basic reality; however, there is also nothing that is Brahman: there is no
					separable, knowable object that corresponds to the idea of Brahman. To explain
					this, Shankara offers the example of the sun shining down on a number of pots,
					all of which are filled with water: each pot offers its own particular
					reflection of the light of the sun, and yet there is still only one sun. How
					then might Brahman be known? Shankara’s answer lies in the identity of
					Brahman and the atman, the innermost self of pure consciousness. He states that
					Brahman cannot be known externally, via the senses, but can be known internally,
					because it is our innermost essence.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-521"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00372.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">In Shankara’s philosophy</span>, human

					of understanding it. From the conventional and pragmatic standpoint, we have the
					world of sense experience, with all its variety. From an absolute standpoint,
					however, we need to recognize that the experienced world is unreal: it is an
					illusion. We can therefore only experience the ultimate reality, free from
					illusion, through an awareness that comes from pure consciousness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that Shankara took this idea of the two levels of truth from
					Buddhism, in which a similar distinction was being made at this time between
					pragmatic and absolute truth. For both Hindu and Buddhist thought, this
					distinction represented a necessary step in bringing the fundamental
					philosophical ideas of religion together with actual practice. During the first
					millennium, religious practice had been moving increasingly toward devotion to
					various gods and goddesses (or, in the case of Buddhism, different bodhisattva
					images), each of which was regarded as reflecting a true aspect of reality. For
					both Hinduism and Buddhism, this was not an attempt to denigrate conventional
					religion, but to set it in a broader philosophical context.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-523"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000278.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Shankara proposed that</span> the world of the

							causing us, for example, to see things that may not be present.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-524" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Not quite an illusion</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The most obvious way to describe Shankara’s view of the world is that
					he regards it as an illusion (maya), although his claim is slightly more subtle
					than that. Shankara suggests there are two levels of reality, which are both
					false in some way: the apparent world (which we appear to see and touch
					around us), and the pragmatic world (which is a view of the world according to
					our own preconceived notions). While the apparent world is derived from our
					senses’ interpretation, the pragmatic world is derived from our minds
					projecting outward, imposing our ideas upon our environment (such as organizing
					a spiky green shape into “a leaf”). However, both of these ideas
					of the world are incorrect since they are only our representations of the world.
					So we can say that the world of our experience is an illusion, but not that the
					world itself&mdash;beyond the knowledge given by the senses&mdash;is an
					illusion. The world of the senses is maya (illusion). Shankara’s
					philosophy is described as non-dualist because of this; there are not two
					different realities&mdash;the world and Brahman&mdash;but just one.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person becomes aware of the identity of atman (the true self) and
					Brahman (a single reality), there follows a recognition that the conventional
					self, as an object among other objects in the world, is partly an illusion.
					Enlightened awareness is a realization of what we have been all along&mdash;the
					atman of pure consciousness; and compared with this idea, the
					ever-changing and superficial physical body is relatively unreal.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"This world is transitory. One who has taken birth in it is living as if in

						<i class="calibre4">saguna</i> Brahman (unqualified versus
					qualified reality), and the contrast between knowledge gained through sense
					experience, and understanding acquired through pure consciousness, are of
					fundamental importance&mdash;not just for an understanding of Hinduism, but for
					religion in general.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;These distinctions suggest that there are two levels of religion. At a popular
					level there may be devotion to a chosen deity (as in the bhakti tradition), and
					the portrayal of gods and goddesses as having particular qualities or acting
					within the world. However, this devotion is no more than a preliminary step on
					the path toward knowledge and liberation. Liberation can only be achieved
					through the mental discipline required for a level of meditation that leads to
					insight. And that insight, for Shankara, is of a single reality; there is no
					separate world of the gods. This means that if there is only one reality that is
					knowable through inner consciousness, then no religious ceremonies are
					necessary; all a person needs to do is develop insight through the practice of
					meditation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is tempting to say that Shankara promotes philosophy rather than religion,
					but that would not be strictly true: the quest for an awareness of the unity of
					atman and Brahman requires disciplines of meditation that are more of a
					religious exercise than a philosophical questioning. The sort of self-control
					required for insight is not merely intellectual.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shankara’s approach allows him to draw together two very different
					traditions into a single system: the religious ceremonies of the Vedas and the
					later commentaries on them; and the mental discipline of the ascetics, who saw
					themselves as beyond the stage of religious rituals.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"The pure truth of Atman, which is buried under Maya

					many to provide a reliable way to understand the world&mdash;often reflect only
					scientists’ interpretation of the phenomena they examine and are always
					open to modification. The world of sense experience, for example, even when
					explored at the limits of scientific knowledge, is just an approximation of
					reality, measured through the tools available, as opposed to reality itself. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the scientific methods used in attempting to discover reality may
					actually interfere with and influence the nature of what is observed. For
					instance, the very act of observing and measuring an experiment at quantum level
					can significantly alter the outcome.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What science may perceive as truth or reality would, in Shankara’s
					philosophy, still be considered an illusion, on the grounds that there are two
					completely different levels of truth, and that gods and scientific laws alike
					can only approximate to an ultimate reality beyond both reason and sense
					experience. Instead, pure consciouness can only be achieved by transcending

					<a href="#calibre_link-271" class="calibre2">Adi Shankara</a>&mdash;built around the notion of of a single underlying reality, Brahman, with which the
				self (atman) is identified. The starting point for Ramakrishna’s thinking was
				the idea that, in meditation, a person comes to appreciate the divine within, and
				that, to whichever god or goddess they might be devoted, there is only one spiritual
				reality. Therefore, within Hinduism, each person is free to worship in his or her
				own way, while recognizing that ultimately there is only one “Holy
				Power” (Brahman). To Ramakrishna, this suggested that it might be possible to
				experience all religions in just this same, internal or personal way, and therefore
				all spiritual paths might eventually lead to the same goal.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-529"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00013.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as

					described the manner in which he performed Islamic prayers, so that, for a time,
					he felt he really possessed the Muslim faith, and did not even experience any
					desire to look at Hindu temple images.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Muslims would not consider this to be a valid experience of
					Islam, given that he did not engage with its cultural and social practices.
					However, for Ramakrishna, this entirely internal experience led him to conclude
					that any inner journey of self discovery will enable a person to identify with
					what Ramakrishna’s disciple Vivekananda would later describe as the
					“eternal ideal of the spiritual oneness of the whole universe.”
					For Ramakrishna, if religion means a process of internal transformation, and if
					God represents the ultimate reality, it follows that, using whatever set of
					religious ideas are available, an individual can follow a path that is bound to
					converge with all others who are on a similar quest. Ramakrishna believed that
					an individual could encounter “the God within” through any
					religious tradition, and that this transcended any external, cultural, or

				emphasis on nonviolence and the welfare of all creatures. However, he was opposed to
				the idea that, in the face of social injustice, a person should simply retire into
				private spirituality and avoid confrontation. Hinduism had long been divided between
				those who thought that they should follow their social duty, as determined by their
				class and stage of life, and those who opted out of society in order to follow an
				ascetic path of personal religious discipline. Gandhi felt committed to seek
				political and social justice, while at the same time maintaining the fundamental
				ascetic value of nonviolence. He also saw the self-destructiveness and futility of
				opposing violence with violence.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;He believed that an individual could only genuinely seek the truth by discounting
				his or her social position and self-interest. He therefore argued that the

				spent in prison. He regarded noncooperation and civil disobedience as
				“weapons of truth” that an individual or society should not be afraid

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-102"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Buddhism is regarded by some as more of a philosophical system than a
				religion because it does not explicitly involve a god or gods. Its origins are also
				atypical: its founder, Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha (“awakened
				one”), based his teachings not on any mystical vision or appearance, but on
				conclusions he reached after a long period of experience and
				thought&mdash;enlightenment, rather than revelation. Gautama neither affirmed nor
				denied the existence of deities, since they were irrelevant to his ideas, but some
				branches of Buddhism have since become more theistic, even if deities are not
				central to their practice.</p><p class="calibre11">The India in which Gautama grew up was dominated by the Brahmanic religions, and
				incorporated Hindu belief in the idea of samsara&mdash;a soul caught in an eternal
				circle of birth and rebirth. Buddhism proposed a radically different view of how the
				cycle could be broken. Instead of relying on Hindu religious practices, such as
				worship and ritual, Gautama advocated a change of lifestyle; instead of sacred texts
				giving divine guidance and authority, Buddhism offered its founder’s
				teachings as a starting point for meditation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-540"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000192.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-541" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Basic tenets</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The doctrine of Buddhism was passed by word of mouth, at first to
					Gautama’s immediate group of followers, and then through the teachers of
					the monastic order that he founded. It was not until the 1st century BCE,
					hundreds of years after his death, that Gautama’s teachings first
					appeared in written form, in the Tipitaka. This was written in Pali, a Sri
					Lankan dialect, rather than Sanskrit, the language of the scholars. The
					so-called Pali Canon was followed by commentaries, such as the Mahayana Sutras,
					which interpreted Buddha’s teaching.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What Buddhism lacked in theology, it made up for in its analysis of the
					reasons a soul might get caught up in samsara; it explored how to achieve
					enlightenment and nirvana&mdash;the ultimate extinction of desire, aversion,
					and disillusionment. Gautama explained that the main obstacle to escape from the
					cycle of samsara was human suffering, caused by desires and attachments that can
					never be satisfied. He set out “Four Noble Truths”&mdash;the
					central doctrine of Buddhism&mdash;to explain the nature of suffering and how
					it could be overcome: <i class="calibre4">dukkha</i> (the truth of
					suffering), <i class="calibre4">samudaya</i> (the truth of the origin
					of suffering), <i class="calibre4">nirodha</i> (the truth of the
					ending of suffering), and <i class="calibre4">magga</i> (the truth of
					the path to the ending of suffering). This last Noble Truth alludes to the
					Middle Way&mdash;the lifestyle advocated by the Buddha, which is simple in
					concept but hard to attain.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-542" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Spread and diversification</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Buddhism spread rapidly from northern India southwards across the subcontinent
					and northwards into China. Different traditions of Buddhism began to emerge. The
					two main branches, Theravada and Mahayana, continue to the present day, much
					along regional lines.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Theravada, with its conservative and austere approach, remained closer to
					Buddha’s original teachings, but became increasingly localized to
					southern India and especially Sri Lanka. Theravada was revitalized in the 12th
					century when trade took it into Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahayana Buddhism had a more overtly religious following, offering its
					adherents temples and rituals, as well as rich symbolism and images of the
					Buddha. Like Theravada, Mahayana also dwindled in India, but it was
					enthusiastically adopted in Tibet, China, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. A key
					element of Mahayana is the concept of religious leaders known as bodhisattvas,
					who have achieved enlightenment but remain on earth to show the way to
					others.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Later divisions within these two major traditions also occurred. These gave
					rise to such contrasting branches as Zen Buddhism, which aims to clear the mind
					in order to allow spontaneous enlightenment without ritual, scripture, or
					reasoning; and the various forms of Tibetan Buddhism that are characterized by
					colorful temples, images, and rituals.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Buddhism is estimated to have more than 500 million adherents, and is
					considered to be the fourth largest religion in the world (after Christianity,
					Islam, and Hinduism). However, despite growing Western interest in it as both a
					religion and a philosophy, it has been in decline since the latter half of the
					20th century, falling from its position as the largest single religion in the
					early 1950s.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				and political change. There was terrible bloodshed as local rule by tribal groups
				gave way to the rise of new kingdoms. Cities were expanding, drawing people away
				from the simplicity of agricultural village life, and trade was flourishing. At the
				same time, people were starting to ask fundamental questions about life and the
				basis of religion.</p><p class="calibre11">On the one hand, there was the established Vedic religion, based on sacrifice and
				the authority of the Vedic texts, to which few outside the brahmin, or priestly
				class of Indian society, had access. This was a formal and conformist religion; it
				required obedience to tradition and maintained class differences. On the other hand,
				many wandering teachers were challenging formal religion. Some of these withdrew
				from society to practice asceticism (the self-denial of material comforts), opting
				for simplicity and deprivation as a means of spiritual development. They rejected
				both physical comfort and social norms, and lived outside the class system. Other
				wandering teachers followed the Lokayata materialist philosophy, rejecting
				conventional spiritual teachings in favor of a life based on pleasure, in the belief
				that there is nothing beyond the physical world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-544"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00158.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-545" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Siddhartha seeks answers</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One wealthy man, Siddhartha Gautama, decided, on reaching adulthood, that his
					comfortable lifestyle was incompatible with his growing awareness of
					life’s hardships and the certainty of death. In addition, material
					comforts offered no protection from these harsh realities of life. So he
					embarked on a religious quest to find the origin of suffering, and the answer to
					it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For seven years he practiced severe asceticism, depriving himself of all but
					the minimum sustenance, but he found that this did not help him find the
					knowledge he sought. He therefore abandoned the ascetic life, while remaining
					determined to discover the cause of suffering. He is said to have gained
					enlightenment (becoming aware of the true nature of reality) during an all-night
					session of meditation, and this gave him an answer to the problems of suffering,
					aging, and death. From that point his followers were to refer to him as Buddha,
					an honorary title meaning one who is fully awake or the enlightened one.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-546"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00238.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Enlightenment</span> came to Siddhartha after

					level, this suggests a middle way between the two types of existence that he
					rejected: the life of luxury, attempting to obtain protection from
					suffering with material comforts, and that of extreme austerity, denying himself
					almost everything in pursuit of spiritual growth. The approach or way he found
					involved a moderate amount of discipline in order to live an ethical life, free
					from indulgence in either sensual pleasures or self-mortification. But
					Buddha’s Middle Way is also set between two other extremes:
					eternalism (where a person’s spirit has purpose and lives forever) and
					nihilism (extreme skepticism in which the value or meaningfulness of everything
					in life is denied).</p></div><div id="calibre_link-548" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Eternalism and nihilism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Vedic religion, particularly as it was developed in the texts known as the
						<a href="#calibre_link-164" class="calibre2">Upanishads</a>,
					argued that the true self of every person is the atman, which is eternal and is
					reincarnated from life to life. The atman is linked to the physical body only
					temporarily, and is essentially independent of it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Crucially, the Vedic religion identified this atman with Brahman, the
					fundamental divine reality that underlies everything. Ordinary things in the
					world (such as trees, animals, and rocks) are an illusion, known as maya; truth
					and reality are to be found beyond these physical things. When Buddha rejected
					the eternal nature of the self, he was rejecting a key feature of Hindu thought
					and religion.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha also rejected the other extreme&mdash;nihilism, which holds that
					ultimately nothing matters or has any value. Nihilism can be expressed in two
					ways, both of which were practiced during Buddha’s lifetime. One way is
					the path of asceticism: purifying the body by the harshest austerity
					possible, and rejecting everything that the worldly consider to be of value.
					This was the path that Buddha had attempted and found wanting. The other way of
					living out nihilistic beliefs was that taken up in India by followers of the
					unorthodox Lokayata school of philosophy: the wholehearted embrace of
					materialism. Their view was that if everything is simply a temporary arrangement
					of physical elements, there is no enduring soul that can be influenced by good
					or bad deeds during life. Furthermore, if there is no life after death, the best
					policy is to seek as much pleasure as possible in this life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in rejecting these two extremes, Buddha did not simply opt for a
					Middle Way in the sense of a negotiated compromise; rather, his view was based
					on an insight that is key to understanding the whole of Buddhist
					teaching: the concept of interconnectedness.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-549" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Three marks of existence</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Buddha pointed out that all things in life come about as a result of certain
					causes and conditions; when these cease, the elements that depend upon them will
					also cease. Nothing, therefore, has a permanent or independent existence. The
					Sanskrit term for such mutual dependence is <i class="calibre4">pratitya
						samutpada</i>, of which a literal translation might be things
					stepping up together. The phrase is sometimes translated as dependent
					origination, better to convey the idea that nothing originates in
					itself&mdash;everything is dependent upon prior causes. We live in a world in
					which everything is interconnected and nothing is the source of its own
					being.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple but profound observation leads to what are known as the three
					universal marks of existence. The first is <i class="calibre4">anicca</i>: that everything is impermanent and subject to change. We
					may wish it were not so, but it is.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha said that the quest for permanence and the certainty of things
					having a fixed essence leads people to have a general sense of dissatisfaction
					with life (dukkha), and this constitutes the second mark of existence. Dukkha is
					sometimes translated as suffering, but it means more than physical suffering or
					the inevitability of death&mdash;it points to existential frustration. Life
					does not necessarily provide us with what we want and, at the same time, it
					contains things, events, and other people that we don’t want. Nothing in
					life gives us complete satisfaction; everything has its limitations.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The third mark of existence is anata: that, because everything is constantly
					changing, nothing has a fixed self or essence. Conventionally, we see things
					(such as trees) as separate from one another, and define them on that basis. In
					reality, however, because everything depends on those elements that bring it
					about (trees cannot grow without soil, water, and sunlight), nothing can be
					defined or permanently fixed in the way that our common sense and language
					supposes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of interconnectedness, as well as the three marks of existence
					implied within it, is a matter of observation rather than argument. It is not a
					statement of how the world should be, simply that this is how it is&mdash;and
					that attempts to deny it are the root cause of our daily frustration.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha’s subsequent teaching was shaped by the concept of
					interconnectedness. By relating dukkha, or dissatisfaction, to the process of
					change, the concept suggests that there are ways or conditions under which it
					could be minimized. Buddha explained what these were in the teachings that
					became known as the Four Noble Truths and the <a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre2">Noble Eightfold Path</a>.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-550"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00239.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Buddhist monks do not</span> cultivate
							hardship for its own sake; they are expected to eat moderately and
							depend on the gifts of lay people for their food&mdash;a practical
							example of interdependence.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-551" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Applying the Middle Way to daily life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In many practical ways, the spirit of the Middle Way shapes Buddhist practice.
					For example, some branches of Buddhism emphasize the value of the monastic life,
					but vows are not taken for life, and many of those who spend either a few months
					or years as a monk or nun later return to <a href="#calibre_link-145" class="calibre2">family
						life</a>.
					Similarly, in order not to cause unnecessary suffering, Buddhists aim to be
					vegetarian. But if it is difficult to obtain a vegetarian diet, or medical
					conditions suggest that a carnivorous diet is necessary, meat-eating is
					acceptable. Monks, who rely on gifts of food, are expected to eat whatever they
					are given. None of this is a matter of compromise; it is the recognition that
					everything depends on prevailing conditions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Middle Way also has profound implications for our general understanding of
					religion, ethics, and philosophy. In practical terms, it argues that the reality
					of life, with its constant change and the inevitability of old age and death,
					cannot be permanently avoided either by material security or self-denial. Taken
					into a person’s heart, this view can shape that person’s values
					and ethics, and affect how they choose to live their life.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises.
						When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of
						this, that ceases."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Buddha</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-552"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00284.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Just as a flower lives</span> and then dies,
							Buddha’s universal marks of existence hold that everything is

							flux.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-553" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A flexible philosophy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In terms of religion, Buddhism’s denial of the unchanging, eternal self
					as defined in the Hindu Upanishads was revolutionary. It suggested that life
					cannot be understood, or its suffering avoided, by conventional religious
					beliefs. Buddhism&mdash;if seen as a religion rather than an ethical
					philosophy&mdash;does not deny the existence of gods, or some form of an
					eternal soul, but regards them as an unnecessary distraction. When asked if the
					world was eternal, or whether an enlightened person lived on after
					death&mdash;questions that are often seen to be at the heart of religious
					belief&mdash;Buddha refused to answer. In terms of philosophy, Buddhism argues
					that knowledge starts from an analysis of experience, rather than abstract
					speculation. This meant that Buddhism was able to remain undogmatic, flexible,
					and open to new cultural ideas, while retaining its basic insight. The
					interconnectedness of all things, experienced in the balance between continuity
					and change, is the basis upon which Buddhist philosophy is built.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddhism’s concepts also had psychological significance. By suggesting
					that the self was not simple and eternal, but complex and subject to change, it
					became possible for people to explore the self as a non-fixed entity. Moreover,
					Buddha’s invitation to follow the Middle Way was open to all, making
					Buddhism, despite its lack of interest in a god or gods, an attractive
					proposition in a society bound by convention and ritual.</p></div><div class="calibre18"></div><div class="section_feature6" id="calibre_link-53"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-554"><img alt="" src="images/00143.jpeg" class="calibre20" /></div><p class="intro">Born in 563 BCE into the ruling family of the Shakya clan of northeast India,

					Noble Truths,” which give an overview of the human problem of suffering
					and solutions for it. The Truths, which are believed to be the subject of the
					Buddha’s first sermon following his enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree,
					revolve around this issue.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of Buddha’s Four Noble Truths is dukkha, the truth of
					suffering. This is the idea that all life involves suffering, which lies at the
					heart of Buddhist teachings, and was the revelation that began Siddhartha
					Gautama’s long search for truth. Human life, Buddha said, is fragile and
					always vulnerable. What is more, life is characterized by suffering. The nature
					of this suffering is very broad, meaning not necessarily intense pain, but also
					lesser, more widespread feelings of dissatisfaction. It may be the emotional
					suffering caused by the death of a loved one, an enduring sense that life is
					somehow pointless or empty, or simply a feeling of being stuck in an unpleasant
					situation, such as a traffic jam. Dukkha is the feeling that arises in
					situations that cause stress, discomfort, or dissatisfaction. It makes us feel
					that we want to be somewhere, or even someone else.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha thought that the search for happiness leads people in the wrong
					direction. Individuals crave things&mdash;sensual pleasure, wealth, power,
					material possessions&mdash;in the hope that these things will make them happy.
					But the falsity of this thought lies behind <i class="calibre4">samudaya</i>, the Second Noble Truth: that the origin of
					suffering is craving. <i class="calibre4">Tanha</i>, the Buddhist
					term for this craving, indicates people’s attempts to hold on to what
					they like, imagining that if only they could have a certain thing and keep it,
					all their problems would be solved. <i class="calibre4">Tanha</i> can
					be translated as “thirst,” suggesting how natural and essential
					this craving seems to us. Buddha argued that even so, this craving is
					counterproductive, leading only to more suffering and unhappiness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Buddha, this craving for things goes beyond material objects and
					the wish for power&mdash;it includes the need to cling to particular views and
					ideas, rules, and observances, which is equally harmful. In this way, Buddhism
					takes a radically different view from the majority of religions, which tend to
					regard people’s acceptance of doctrines and religious observances as
					essential to salvation. While Buddha did not say that such beliefs are harmful
					in themselves, he warned against clinging to them in the assumption that they
					will automatically help in the path to overcome suffering.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-557"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00329.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">People are often moved</span> to tears at

This means that
					something must cause suffering; and if that cause is removed, suffering will
					cease. The Second Noble Truth identifies craving as the cause&mdash;so Buddha
					said that if the craving were to stop, the suffering would cease. The Third
					Noble Truth, <i class="calibre4">nirodha</i> (the cessation of
					suffering and the causes of suffering), refers to the absence of craving.
					Putting an end to craving does not involve stopping life’s normal
					activities&mdash;Buddha himself carried on teaching for 45 years after his
					enlightenment, and was subject to all the usual problems that afflict human
					beings. Rather, it refers to a state in which a person understands and deals
					with life, without the emotional need to crave for it to be other than it
					is.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Third Noble Truth comes a point of peace called, in Sanskrit,
					nirvana. This is a state beyond craving or desire for anything or anyone. It is
					not the same as extinction; Buddha was critical of those who tried to escape
					reality by craving annihilation. Rather, the triple fires of greed, hatred, and
					illusion&mdash;three characteristics that perpetuate human suffering&mdash;are
					blown out like a candle. In other words, by letting go of destructive craving,
					the mind is liberated from suffering and unhappiness. This leads to a state of
					engaged happiness: a form of happiness that results from good moral
					conduct.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike everything else, nirvana is not thought to be the result of cause and
					effect, but stands beyond or outside it. It is said to be permanent and
					unchanging: while everything in the world around us, and we ourselves, are
					temporary and have arisen because of certain conditions, nirvana is an
					unconditioned, uncaused state and is therefore an absolute truth for Buddhists.
					This blissful state of being is accessible to us on earth and in our lifetimes.
					Unlike most religions, which encourage people to live a moral life in the
					present in order to attain happiness in a world beyond this one, Buddhism says
					that a true end to suffering is possible immediately, in this world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha himself attained a state of nirvana at the age of 35, and through his
					teachings sought to show others how to reach this enlightenment. The Fourth
					Noble Truth describes “the path that leads to the end of
					suffering.” This is <i class="calibre4">magga</i>, the Middle
					Way, also known as the “Noble Eightfold Path.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-560"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00333.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Material goods</span> such as shoes may be
							advertised as must-have items, in an attempt to create a desire or

					However, these need not be taken sequentially as they are eight principles,
					rather than actions, that allow Buddhists to overcome craving and achieve
					happiness. The Noble Eightfold Path deals with the three basic aspects of the
					Buddhist life: wisdom (in the first two steps), virtue (in the next three), and
					concentration (in the final three). Wisdom, for Buddha, is made up of two
					directions in which to turn the mind: “right view” and
					“right intention.” The first of these is important in order to be
					able to see and identify the cause and cure of suffering, as outlined in the
					Four Noble Truths. Without a willingness to explore that view, the rest of the
					path makes little sense. Right intention could equally be described as
					“right commitment”&mdash;it refers to our intention to follow the
					path, because a mere understanding of the teaching (without also adopting an
					intention to act on it) is of no use.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps three, four, and five of the path offer practical moral guidelines.
					Buddhist morality is not about rules to be obeyed, but about creating conditions
					that facilitate the path toward enlightenment. Step three states that we must
					use “right speech”: avoid telling lies, speaking harshly or
					cruelly, and listening to or spreading purposeless chatter and malicious gossip.
					Instead, we must cultivate the opposite: truthful, positive, kindly, and
					purposeful speech.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Step four says that we must take “right action” by following the
					five moral “precepts”: not to destroy life, not to steal, not to
					misuse the senses, not to lie, and not to cloud the mind with intoxicants (the
					last is of particular importance for those who are engaging in the mental
					training that forms the final part of the path). The fifth step also supports an
					ethical approach, suggesting that we must pursue a “right
					livelihood.” This is the requirement to earn a living in a way that does
					not go against Buddhist moral principles.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"There are four kinds of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging
						to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of
						the self."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sammaditthi Sutta</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-165"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">THE PALI CANON</h4><p class="intro">In the 400 years after Buddha died, his teachings and the guidelines for
					monastic life were passed down orally using local languages, rather than
					Sanskrit, which was the language used in the Hindu scriptures. However, in the
					1st century BCE, his teachings were written down in Sri Lanka using a language
					and script called Pali, which was closely related to the language that Buddha
					himself spoke. These texts are collectively referred to as the Pali Canon, and
					they form the scriptures of the <a href="#calibre_link-7" class="calibre2">Theravada
						Buddhist tradition</a>.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pali Canon is also known as the Tipitaka (in Pali) and the Tripitaka (in
					Sanskrit), meaning “three baskets.” It is divided into three
					sections: the Vinaya Pitaka, which contains guidance on monastic life; the Sutta
					Pitaka, a collection of Buddha’s sayings and accounts of events in his
					life; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a philosophical analysis of Buddha’s
					teachings.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-561" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cultivating right mind</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The last three steps advise on how to carry out the right mental training for
					reaching nirvana. Step six says that “right effort” should be
					applied. This requires a person to be conscious of and set aside negative or
					harmful thoughts as they arise, replacing them with their positive equivalent.
					So, for example, at the beginning of the Dhammapada (the “Verses of the
					Dhamma”), the Buddha says that those who resent the actions of others, or
					brood upon injuries sustained in the past, will never become free of hate. Right
					effort encapsulates the conscious intention to break the cycle of resentment and
					negative response.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh step tells us to pursue “right mindfulness.” It is
					all too easy for our minds to become distracted, flitting from one thing to
					another. An important step in mental discipline is to be fully aware of the
					present moment and to allow the mind to be quietly focused on just one thing.
					This is seen in meditation techniques such as “mindfulness of
					breathing” or “just sitting,” which generally form the
					starting point for training in Buddhist meditation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The final, eighth, step on the path encourages us to apply “right
					concentration.” The practice of meditation is a crucial aspect of
					following the Buddhist dhamma. This step recognizes that control of the mind is
					central to being able to overcome suffering, since what is being addressed is
					not physical pain or death itself, but the sense of existential angst that can
					accompany them. In insight meditation, a person may calmly and deliberately
					contemplate those things that most people try to avoid thinking about, such as
					death. In a meditation on <i class="calibre4">metta</i>, or love,
					positive thoughts are cultivated toward others, from people we love to those we
					naturally find most difficult. This exercise encourages benevolence and the
					development of a more positive set of mental qualities.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Noble Eightfold Path offers a program of self-development. However,
					Buddhism does not have a set of commands or doctrines to be accepted; instead,
					it suggests a way to live that will ease suffering. Different people will
					concentrate on different aspects of the path, depending on their circumstances.
					In addition, the path itself is not a straight route that begins at step one and
					ends at step eight. It is not considered necessary to deal with any one of the
					steps before moving on to another step. The three main aspects of understanding,
					morality, and meditation may be used to reinforce one another. Some steps,
					however, such as those that deal with ethical issues, may be important in
					setting up the conditions in our lives in which meditation can become truly
					effective.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"There is a Middle Way… which leads to peace, to direct knowledge,

						teaching</a> is “interconnectedness”: the idea
					that everything arises because of preexisting causes and conditions. The
					Buddhist path is therefore one that works always with context; it aims to create
					the conditions that allow angst and suffering to be replaced by contentment and
					happiness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that if we look at the chain of causes and effects of events in our
					lives, we can look for the links that might be changed so that our lives can
					take a different course. If it were not possible to choose differently and alter
					the outcomes of situations, people’s fates and their every action would
					be absolutely determined, with no escape from suffering. So, although Buddhism
					takes from Hinduism the idea of karma (that actions have consequences), it does
					not accept this in any rigid or mechanical sense. There is always an element of
					choice in our actions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddhist view of actions and consequences is presented in graphic form in
					the “Wheel of Life,” a complex piece of iconography that depicts
					suffering and possible ways to overcome it. Everything within the wheel
					represents the world of samsara&mdash;a world of endless rebirth in which all
					beings are trapped as a consequence of their karmic actions. The wheel itself is
					held within the jaws of a fearsome demon, who represents death.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the wheel are three creatures&mdash;a cock, a snake, and a
					pig&mdash;that represent the three poisons: greed, hatred, and ignorance.
					Buddha saw these as the starting point or root of the unwholesome life and thus
					of human suffering. Surrounding them is a circle filled with human beings either
					descending or ascending, who pass by a series of realms depicted in the next
					circle. These realms are those of humans, animals, gods, <i class="calibre4">asuras</i> (warlike beings constantly doing battle), hungry ghosts,
					and hell (the lowest of states). The implication is that people can move from
					one realm to another. It is from the human realm that they may escape to a
					happier state of existence through the teachings of Buddha.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For those seeking to understand the process by which Buddhists can achieve
					this&mdash;by overcoming suffering&mdash;it is the outermost wheel that is the
					most important. The twelve <i class="calibre4">nidanas</i>, or links,
					in the outer wheel give graphic expression to the interconnectedness that is
					central to Buddhist teaching. They feature people and buildings, from a blind
					man (who represents a starting point in total spiritual ignorance) to a house
					with five windows (representing the mind and senses). There is a crucial
					opportunity offered between the seventh and eighth <i class="calibre4">nidanas</i>, which show a man with an arrow in his eye (representing
					feelings of pain) and a woman offering a man a drink (feelings leading to
					craving). It is this link&mdash;between the pain or pleasure that comes from
					contact with the world and the resulting craving&mdash;that is critical. If the
					link holds, the process of re-becoming (samsara) continues forever. If it can be
					broken, there is the possibility of escape from the cycle of existence and
					suffering.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The breaking of the link signals a return to the starting point of
					Buddha’s route to the end of suffering: the ability to engage with life
					without allowing that experience to generate the craving that arises from
					attachment and disappointment. And to set up the conditions to help break that
						<i class="calibre4">nidana</i> link, people should follow the
					Noble Eightfold Path. Through taking action they may find nirvana. According to
					Buddhism, there is no god to save humanity, so what people need to cultivate is
					wisdom rather than faith.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Finding themselves threatened by danger, people take refuge in spirits,

					most of the questions posed by Western philosophy, such as speculation about why

				could achieve enlightenment, since they practiced Buddhism and helped the community
				of monks. About a hundred years after Buddha died, debates began about how strictly
				the monastic rules should be obeyed. As Buddhism spread, it developed different

					these precepts has a positive counterpart, effectively generating five rules
					relating to things one should do. The first of these is to treat all beings with
					loving-kindness (<i class="calibre4">metta</i>); indeed, one of the
					principal meditation practices in Buddhism is the cultivation of goodwill toward
					everyone&mdash;treating friends, strangers, and even those that one might find
					difficult with equal care and concern. The broad, positive approach evident in
					this first rule underpins the other four. Positive goodwill toward others
					supports the principles of generosity; nonexploitation (the third precept is
					generally taken to prohibit adultery, rape, and other forms of sexual
					exploitation); honesty; and the keeping of a clear head to ensure corrrect
					decisions and actions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the principle of not killing was a key feature of Buddhism from its

					made by the Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century BCE. This is evident from the many
					edicts that he issued, 32 of which have been discovered carved on pillars or
					rock faces. As well as advocating the avoidance of killing, Asoka promoted
					support for the poor, the protection of servants, and the establishment of

					Milinda</i>, written anonymously in the 1st century CE. This text
				describes the discussions between a Buddhist sage known as Nagasena, and King
				Milinda&mdash;the Indo-Greek ruler of northwestern India, c.150 BCE.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-581"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00110.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The monk Nagasena</span> is often referred to as
						one of the Sixteen (or Eighteen) Arhats, beings who have realized a very
						high level of spiritual attainment.</p></div></div><div id="calibre_link-582" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Analyzing the self</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Milinda starts by innocently asking whether the person he is greeting is
					indeed Nagasena, whereupon Nagasena launches straight into the discussion by
					stating that although the name Nagasena is conventionally used to refer to
					himself, there is actually nothing that corresponds to it. The word is a
					designation, a “mere name,” because “no real person is here
					apprehended.” In an absolute sense, Nagasena does not exist.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewildered, the King asks how that can be the case, since Nagasena is clearly
					standing there in front of him. To answer this, Nagasena uses an analogy. He
					observes that the King arrived in a chariot, so it is obvious that a chariot
					exists. But he then starts to analyze the various parts of the chariot: the
					axle, the wheels, and so on, and asks the King if any of these
					“are” the chariot&mdash;eliciting the answer that they are not.
					So where is the chariot, Nagasena asks, if it is not the wheels, or the axle,
					and so on? Clearly, there is no chariot over and above the parts from which it
					is constructed. Chariot is a name applied to the collection of those parts when
					they are put together to make the vehicle. In the same way, Nagasena argues,
					there is no fixed or permanent self over and above the various parts of which we
					are made. Nagasena does not represent anything that Milinda could point to. Like
					the chariot, “Nagasena” refers to a set of elements that exist in
					a state of mutual dependence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddhists view the human being as made up of five interdependent <i class="calibre4">skandhas</i> (literally, heaps). These are: form (our
					physical body); sensations (information about the world that is constantly fed
					to us by our senses); perception (our awareness of the world through
					sensations); and mental formations or impulses (our ongoing flow of ideas,
					intentions, and thoughts about the things we perceive).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth <i class="calibre4">skandha</i> is consciousness: the
					general sense we have of being alive&mdash;including an awareness of the
					information streaming in from our senses, and of our thoughts, ideas, and
					emotions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The key feature of Nagasena’s argument is that each of these <i class="calibre4">skandhas</i> is constantly changing. This is most
					obvious in the case of form, or the physical body, as we change from being a
					baby to an adult through the physical process of aging. But it is also true of
					the other four <i class="calibre4">skandhas</i>: they too are in no
					way fixed. They reflect a constantly changing stream of experience and response
					as we engage with life. This means that not only is it impossible to point to
					Nagasena, it is also impossible to say whether anyone is the same person during
					the course of one lifetime. Nevertheless, we still have a sense of a person
					being the same over a lifetime, since each of us has a past and a future.
					Nagasena points out that it is absurd to say he remains the same over time, but
					likewise absurd to say he does not. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Nagasena insists that the questions themselves are wrong, because
					they presuppose a fixed self instead of one that is dependent upon the body. In
					a further example to illustrate the dependency of the self, Nagasena asks
					Milinda to consider milk, curds, butter, and ghee. These are not the same
					things, but the three later stages&mdash;curds, butter, and ghee&mdash;cannot
					be made unless milk first exists. That is to say that butter only exists because
					milk exists; it depends on the existence of milk. In the same way, says
					Nagasena, “do the elements of being join one another in serial
					succession: one element perishes, another arises, succeeding each other as it
					were instantaneously.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"I am known as Nagasena. But the word “Nagasena” is only a

					that the material body is linked to a nonphysical mind. In doing so, he used an
					argument that is exactly parallel to Nagasena’s. A visitor to the city of
					Oxford who has been shown various colleges, libraries, and so on, asks,
					“But where is the university?” Ryle claims that there is no
					university over and above its constituent parts. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, there is no mind that exists separately from the body. People who
					suppose that there is are making a category mistake&mdash;where things of one
					kind are presented as though they belong to another. It is wrong to treat the
					mind as though it is an object of substance, when mind refers to a collection of
					capacities and dispositions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the end of the 20th century, and into the 21st, most Western
					philosophers have argued for a materialist (or physicalist) view of the mind:
					that mind is simply a word that describes brain function. For modern science,
					there is no self over and above the body; the brain performs a complex
					processing of experience and response, which we think of as our mind, or self. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This differs from Nagasena only in the way that the sage applies a closer
					analysis of the way in which we experience ourselves as thinking, feeling, and
					responding beings. As he pointed out to King Milinda, even the fact that we do
					this does not mean that there is a separate thing called the self.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The other modern philosophy that unwittingly builds on this Buddhist idea is
					existentialism. It is often summed up in the phrase “existence precedes
					essence,” meaning that we are born and exist before our lives have
					obtained any sense of purpose. Existentialism suggests that we shape our lives
					by the choices we make, and should acknowledge our responsibility for doing so:
					we are what we choose to do&mdash;we do not have an internal real self or
					essence.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present

					teaching: the difference between conventional and absolute truth. In order to
					function normally, we have to assume a pragmatic or practical approach and refer
					to objects as though they have a recognizable, permanent, and independent
					existence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be impossible to communicate if everything had to be described in
					terms of its constituent parts. Buddhism therefore accepts the need for such
					conventional truth, but constantly guards against mistaking it for absolute
					truth.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-587"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">A MEETING OF CULTURES</h4><p class="intro">The meeting between King Milinda and Nagasena occurred in the context of a
					meeting of cultures. Buddhism had spread to northern India through the teachings
					of missionaries sent by the Emperor Asoka around 100 years earlier. Meanwhile,
					the influence of classical Greece was spreading eastward from the Mediterranean,
					and, when it reached northern India, it was adopted by local rulers (a process
					known as Hellenization). Milinda&mdash;or Menander, as he is known in
					Greek&mdash;was one such king. He ruled a region known as the Indo-Greek
					Kingdom&mdash;in present-day northwestern India&mdash;in the 2nd century BCE,
					so we may assume that Nagasena lived in that area sometime between the 2nd and
					1st century CE.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;While evidence of Milinda exists in the form of coins and references by
					classical writers, we know very little about the philosopher-monk Nagasena. His
					only appearance in literature is his dialogue with the King in <i class="calibre4">The Questions of King Milinda</i>, a widely respected
					text in Theravada Buddhism that was written in the 1st century CE. One legend
					about Nagasena states that while living in Pataliputra (modern-day Patna,
					India), he created the Emerald Buddha, a jade statue of Buddha clothed in gold,
					which is now in Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok, Thailand.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-43" class="calibre2">Preparing for the afterlife</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-54" class="calibre2">The ultimate reality</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-55" class="calibre2">Seeing with pure consciousness</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-56" class="calibre2">The enlightenment of Buddha</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-57" class="calibre2">Immortality in Christianity</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					people started to speculate about Buddha’s previous lives, and the
					actions and characteristics he must have displayed in those lives to move toward
					nirvana. These musings led to the compilation of Jataka tales or “birth
					stories,” involving characters, sometimes human and sometimes animal,
					that depicted the Buddhist qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom deemed
					necessary for progress toward enlightenment. In turn, these stories led to the
					idea of the “bodhisattva”: a being who is capable of
					enlightenment&mdash;or of buddhahood&mdash;but who chooses to remain in the
					world, continuing to be reborn, in order to benefit all other beings. This idea
					brought about a remarkable change in the overall view of the Buddhist path.
					Instead of striving to become an arhat, or “worthy one” (the term
					used for those of Buddha’s followers who have gained enlightenment), it
					was now possible for Buddhists to dedicate themselves to the more exalted path
					of becoming, in effect, apprentice buddhas&mdash;bodhisattvas who engage with

					was implicit in the original Buddhist dhamma. Its scriptures&mdash;notably the
					Lotus Sutra&mdash;present an image of Buddha preaching to beings in a vast
					universe made up of many world systems, of which this present world is a very
					small part. Followers of Mahayana argue that the earlier teaching was a
					necessarily limited version, and that their own was kept hidden for many
					centuries, awaiting the right conditions to allow it to be preached. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahayana Buddhism, although it developed in India, spread north and was
					established in China and then in Tibet. The earlier tradition still exists as

					will arrive in the future to preach the truth of the dhamma. However, in
					Mahayana Buddhism, lay people as well as the monastic community are encouraged
					to reach nirvana and thereafter to become bodhisattvas. Once the possibility of
					a vast number of bodhisattvas was accepted, each dedicated to the task of
					universal enlightenment, the floodgates of Buddhist iconography were opened,

					flaming sword (representing the wisdom with which he cuts through the veil of
					ignorance).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The most widely venerated of images is that of Avalokiteshvara, the
					Bodhisattva of Compassion. His name is a Sanskrit word meaning “The Lord
					who looks down.” He looks upon earthly beings as a good father would upon
					his children, offering them assistance and trying to liberate them from their
					faults and suffering through his unwavering compassion. Known to Tibetans as
					Chenrezig, Avalokiteshvara takes on a female form as Kuan Yin in China, and
					Kannon in Japan. Avalokiteshvara is most commonly depicted as having four arms:
					two are crossed over his heart, a third holds a lotus flower, and a fourth holds
					a rosary. The crossed arms symbolize the boddhisattva’s compassionate
					outpouring from his heart to earthly beings. The lotus flower represents
					enlightenment and pure wisdom, while the rosary symbolizes his desire to
					liberate earthly beings from their endless cyclical existence. The <a href="#calibre_link-176" class="calibre2">14th Dalai Lama</a>
					is traditionally thought of as an incarnation of this Bodhisattva of
					Compassion.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all Mahayana images are elaborate in appearance. Each of the <i class="calibre4">dhyana</i> or “meditation” buddhas such
					as Buddha Amitabha, for example, are depicted sitting cross-legged, wearing a
					very plain robe, their eyes closed in meditation. However elaborate or not these
					images may be, and however far removed they may appear to be from the
					straightforward teaching of the historical Buddha, they are all taken to
					represent aspects of enlightenment. They are not gods to be worshipped, although
					it may be hard to remember this when observing Buddhists paying tribute to them
					in temples and shrines.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-595"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00300.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Buddhists may offer</span> incense or flowers

					In meditation, a person may become adept at visualizing his or her chosen image,
					being able to construct it imaginatively at will. So, the practitioner of
					meditation has an ongoing relationship with a particular image. It is often
					selected for that purpose, on the advice of a teacher, in order to address a
					particular quality&mdash;represented by the image of a bodhisattva or
					buddha&mdash;that the individual needs or wants to develop. The benefit of such
					a practice is generally only apparent over a period of time; it is not seen as
					an automatic process, but one that requires sustained personal attention to the
					qualities and ideals that the image represents.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"May I be an unending treasury for those desperate and forlorn. May I

					development, whether used for meditation or instruction. A mandala is a
					geometric pattern in which various shapes, letters, and images of buddhas and
					bodhisattvas are intricately interwoven in a complex image.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The patterns are carefully created out of colored sand, displayed at
					festivals, and then destroyed. Their destruction is important because it
					reinforces the idea that everything is temporary. To attempt to retain the
					images would encourage clinging and craving, which are counter to Buddhist
					teachings since they lead to frustration and suffering. It is only through
					letting go&mdash;embracing detachment&mdash;that the journey to enlightenment
					can begin.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-597" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Emptiness and buddhas</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (see facing page) argued that everything is
					empty of inherent existence. By this he meant that nothing in the world,
					including all living beings, has a self or, therefore, an underlying essence (or
					“inherent existence”). He maintained that this idea was implied by
						<a href="#calibre_link-53" class="calibre2">Buddha’s original teaching</a>
					about the concept of interconnectedness, which
					sees earthly items and beings as having no essence (or “own
					being”) because they are all dependent on the prior existence of
					something else. Given that we ourselves have no independent, underlying essence,
					the aim of meditation is to see beyond our senses and the ideas we have gained
					from them, to look directly upon ultimate truth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the buddhas and bodhisattvas may be conjured up in meditation, this
					suggests that they are neither substantial (in other words, they do not have a
					physical embodiment), nor located somewhere else in the universe. Each of the
					images conjured up is not a representation of a person, but part of the ultimate
					truth about the person who sits in meditation. The vast array of buddha and
					bodhisattva images are merely temporary aids to assist a person in recognizing
					that every individual is a potential Buddha.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be

				an offering before a Buddha image), while Tibetan Buddhism is colorful and dramatic.
				During worship, monks may chant repeated phrases (mantras), wear striking
				headdresses, blow horns, and use elaborate hand gestures (mudras)&mdash;often while
				holding small symbolic objects (<i class="calibre4">vajras</i>) and
				bells. Lay Buddhists may also chant, turn prayer wheels, and set out colorful prayer
				flags. At festivals, there may be dramatic performances and dancing, with huge
				images on cloth spread out or hung on temple walls, and the creation and destruction
				of intricate sand patterns, known as <a href="#calibre_link-59" class="calibre2">mandalas</a>. How is
				all of this, which seems so different from the early simplicity of the Buddhist
				path, explained and justified?</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-602"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00165.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">For more than a thousand years, Buddhism and Hinduism coexisted in India and
				influenced one another. When Padmasambhava, revered as the founder of Tibetan
				Buddhism, took the religion to Tibet in the early 8th century, it was in a form
				influenced both by the general Mahayana tradition, which had already spread to
				China, and by the devotional tradition (<i class="calibre4">bhakti</i>)
				of Hinduism that had developed in India during the previous centuries. <i class="calibre4">Bhakti</i> involved a more personal and emotional
				engagement with worship, which was taken a step further in both Hinduism and
				Buddhism with the development of Tantra.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tantra involves not just thinking about what will be achieved by spiritual
				practice, but also a process of acting out. For instance, rather than simply
				visualizing an image of a buddha, the practitioner imagines him or herself <i class="calibre4">as</i> that buddha. This process of emotional engagement
				involves the whole person, not just the intellect, encouraging him or her to feel
				what it would be like to be enlightened.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for example, the mudras that are made in Tantric worship are the same as those
				depicted on the images of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Each of the mudras expresses a
				particular quality: an open-handed gesture, palm turned outward, expresses
				generosity; the fearless mudra with the right hand raised as though giving a
				greeting, a blessing, or even a stop sign, is believed to induce a feeling of
				determination. By making these gestures, a Buddhist imitates the image of the buddha
				or bodhisattva, and thereby identifies with what it represents. Chanting, mudras,
				and other aspects of Tantric Buddhism aim to immerse the worshipper in a dramatic
				expression of what the path toward enlightenment is about, by not just explaining
				it, but making it feel real.</p><div id="calibre_link-603" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Personalized rituals</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Tantric rituals are performed under the instruction of a teacher, or lama, who

					perform, depending on their personal inclinations and what they hope to

				enlightenment to happen naturally, as a result of a clearing of the mind, and does
				so without the need for rational argument, texts, or rituals. In other words, it
				creates the conditions in which a person’s mental clutter, which detracts
				from clarity of the mind, can be replaced by direct insight.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zen claims to continue a tradition that goes back to the earliest days of Buddhist
				teachings. There is a story that one day, surrounded by his disciples, the Buddha
				simply held up a flower, turning it in his hand without speaking. One of the
				disciples, Kasyapa, smiled; he had seen the point. That wordless insight, it is
				claimed, was passed down from teacher to disciple for 28 generations to Bodhidharma,
				who took it to China, from where it spread to Japan. So, rather than being a product
				of the development of the two main <a href="#calibre_link-7" class="calibre2">Buddhist
					branches, Theravada and Mahayana</a>, Zen sees
				itself as having developed independently via a separate line of transmission.</p><div id="calibre_link-608" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Buddha mind</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Central to Buddhism is the idea that existential unhappiness is caused by the
					illusion that each person has a fixed ego, which is separate from the rest of
					the world, yet which clings to it, trying to hold on to what changes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zen sees this as the small, superficial mind; one that people acquire at
					birth, then develop, influenced by those around them. However, it holds that
					people also have a Buddha mind, freed from egocentric, conceptual thinking. This
					is innate, but hidden by the clutter of the small mind. People gain nothing by
					discovering their Buddha mind, they simply recognize what they have had all
					along.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zen teacher Dogen said that the true self is not the superficial ego that each
					person has now, but the original face he or she had before they were born and
					molded by experience. It is only when people develop their own faces that they
					see themselves as separate entities and become egocentric. Dogen is therefore
					suggesting that people should strive to recognize who they were before they were
					conditioned by life and experience.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-609"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00265.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Sitting and meditating</span> is all that is

					in Japan in the 12th century by Eisai, and reformed in the 18th century by
					Hakuin. This school introduced the Zen view that the world is an illusion and
					that reality is in fact a simple, indivisible unity. Zen has no scriptures or
					formal teachings; it is an oral teaching, a tradition of meditation passed from
					teacher to pupil&mdash;hence the importance of practicing only under the
					guidance of an experienced teacher.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A key feature of Rinzai Zen, introduced by Hakuin, is the use of
					koans&mdash;unanswerable questions that shatter conventional thinking. Probably
					the best-known koan is Hakuin’s, “What is the sound of one hand
					clapping?” Those who think they know the answer to a koan should think
					again, and let go of all preconceived notions. Rationally examining a <i class="calibre4">koan</i>, or a Zen dialogue (a <i class="calibre4">mondo</i>) is unlikely to yield great insight, since it is too easy
					to view it only within the parameters of personal discursive thought. A Zen
					teacher will try to guard against that happening. </p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of Zen practice, a person may suddenly experience
					satori&mdash;insight or enlightenment. This is not a one-time or permanent
					state of enlightenment, but a momentary experience that may be repeated many
					times. It is said to happen almost as if by accident; it cannot be forced,
					because wanting to achieve satori is a form of grasping. Zen does not seek to
					define reality or the nature of satori.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soto Zen was developed in Japan in the 13th century by the teacher Dogen, who
					had traveled in China and there encountered a meditation tradition called
					Ts’ong Tung. His form of meditation is very different from the Rinzai
					form. Instead of trying to trigger sudden insight, Soto Zen is based on sitting
					meditation (zazen) and a more gradual process of enlightenment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soto considered that religious traditions and rituals could be dispensed with:
					enlightenment could be achieved simply through the practice of zazen. This
					involves periods of sitting in an upright, cross-legged position, facing a blank
					wall, interspersed with reflective walking, known as <i class="calibre4">kinhin</i>. In meditation, the mind is cleared of its flow of ideas,
					so that the process of sitting is exactly what enlightenment is about. A person
					does not sit in order to become enlightened; in the act of sitting that person
					is <i class="calibre4">already</i> enlightened. Stilling the mind and
					clearing away the illusion of a separate self is enlightenment.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"If you understand the first word of Zen you will know the last word. The

Careful
					attention to a piece of calligraphy or raking sand in a garden&mdash;both of
					which are features of Zen practice&mdash;can help to free the mind from the
					constant process of thinking, allowing a person to act in greater harmony with
					nature. That is why Zen finds expression in many artistic forms, from flower
					arranging to computer design.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zen is about creating situations that bring insight, without trying to explain
					or express it rationally. To try to describe the goal of Zen is to have failed
					to understand it: Zen aims to set the mind free from content; it is not part of
					that content. Zen is not studied, it is practiced; and if satori or
					enlightenment is finally achieved, nothing new is known&mdash;all that is known
					is that it is not necessary to know anything. Deliberately full of paradoxes,
					Zen aims to gradually break down the normal processes of logical thought.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting to explain something is to grasp at it, and that grasping is what
					the Buddha described as the cause of suffering. In a world where people seek to
					gain things, to claim knowledge and insight like personal possessions, Zen is
					the ultimate frustration. Collecting beautiful Zen artifacts could never result
					in understanding what lies behind their production. Zen is letting go.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, Zen returns to the earliest phase of Buddhism, before the buddha
					and bodhisattva images, devotional practices, and revered scriptures.
					Enlightenment is open to all: indeed, everyone is already enlightened, if only
					they could recognize it. Zen dispenses with almost everything related to
					religion and presents itself as a path of insight and understanding that is
					without religious trappngs.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also deliberately anarchic, its stories provocative, and its teachers
					notoriously challenging. Asked to summarize Buddhism, Bodhidharma is believed to
					have replied, “Vast emptiness; nothing holy”&mdash;not what was
					expected, but to the point.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!"</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Zen koan</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-612"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00216.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">That wind, banner, and mind</span> are not

					Some Jews, later known as the Sephardim, settled in Spain, Portugal, North
					Africa, and the Middle East, but the majority, the Ashkenazim, formed
					communities in Central and Eastern Europe. Inevitably, the geographical
					separation led to differences in the way Judaism developed between the groups,
					and various different religious traditions evolved. In Spain, a Golden Age of
					Jewish thinking flourished between the 10th and 12th centuries, which produced
					great philosophers such as Moses Maimonides. This was also the center, in the
					Middle Ages, of interest in the more mystical aspects of Judaism, known as
					kabbalah. In eastern Europe, a number of the more isolated small Jewish
					settlements, the shtetls, found that the scholarliness of</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;their religion did little to promote strong community ties, and a more
					spiritual movement, Hasidism, emerged as a result. In the following centuries,
					there were further divisions in Judaism, largely over matters of interpretation
					of Jewish Law. Orthodox Judaism advocated a strict adherence to the Torah, which
					was considered to be divine in origin, while Reform and Conservative Judaism
					took a less rigorous approach, regarding the Torah more as a set of guidelines
					rather than obligations. An issue that divided the different branches of Judaism
					in the 20th century was the status of women. In spite of the doctrine ruling
					that Jewish identity is passed down solely through the maternal line, women were
					not able to play an active part in religious ceremonies until recently.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-617" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Oppression and identity</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Largely because of their position as displaced immigrants and their
					distinctive faith, Jews have been widely persecuted throughout their history. In
					many places, they have been isolated in ghettos, and suffered violent
					vilification and attacks. From the 18th century on, countries such as the US and
					France granted them full rights, and there was a movement toward greater
					integration. However, this posed a question of identity. Were the Jewish people
					a religious, ethnic, cultural, or national group? Zionism, which arose in
					response, pressed for the formation of a Jewish state, and matters were brought
					to a head in the aftermath of the Holocaust with the formation of the State of
					Israel in 1948. Today, it is difficult to assess how many followers of Judaism
					there are, because many who identify themselves as Jewish are not actively
					religious. However, it is estimated that there are more than 13 million Jewish
					people in the world, the majority of them living in either North America or
					Israel.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				Judaism, and dates back to the beliefs of the Israelites, an ancient Middle Eastern
				people. In fact, Jews view themselves as bound to God by a series of covenants. The
				Abrahamic covenant was the first, specifically singling out the Israelites as
				God’s chosen people, while the later Mosaic covenants (mediated by Moses)
				renewed this initial bond.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-619"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000026.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">The Israelites, sometimes called Hebrews, were a people who occupied part of
				Canaan, roughly equivalent to modern Israel and Palestine, perhaps as early as the
				15th century BCE. In around 1200 BCE, during a period when this part of the world
				was under Egyptian rule, an inscription was carved that contains the first mention
				of Israel as a people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 6th century BCE, many of the Israelites were forced into exile in
				Babylonia. During this period of exile, much of the Hebrew, or Jewish, Bible was
				composed. It sets down the history of the Israelite people and the origin of their
				religious beliefs.</p><div id="calibre_link-620" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The first covenant</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Like many peoples in the ancient Middle East, the Israelites were polytheists,
					but worshipped a national god, one whom they viewed as offering their people
					particular protection. Jews were later to deem their God’s name too holy
					to pronounce and did not preserve its original vowels, so it became known only
					by its four consonants: YHWH (probably pronounced “Yahweh”). YHWH
					was also known by several other names, including El and Elohim, meaning
					God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Book of Genesis, the first of the five books of the Torah
					(the first section of the Hebrew Bible), it was by God’s decree that the
					Israelites first settled in Canaan. He called on a man, Abraham, born in the
					Mesopotamian city-state of Ur (in modern-day Iraq) and commanded him to travel
					to a place named Canaan, which was to become the Israelite homeland. The Torah
					recounts that in Canaan, God established a covenant with Abraham, which took a
					similar form to a type of royal grant that kings of the time handed out to loyal
					subordinates. It stipulated that, as a reward for Abraham’s loyalty, God
					would grant him many descendants who would inherit the land. As a sign of this
					compact, Abraham and all the male members of his household were circumcised. To
					this day, Jewish boys are circumcised on the eighth day after their birth as a
					sign that they are parties to this pledge.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham had two sons, Ishmael and Isaac. God blessed Ishmael, promising that
					he would become the father of a great nation. But it was Isaac that God chose to
					inherit the covenant from his father, appearing to him directly. Isaac in turn
					handed down the covenant to his son Jacob, who in his turn received the name
					Israel from God and handed the covenant down to all his offspring.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are known as Israel’s patriarchs, because
					they represent the first three generations included in the covenant with
					God.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-621"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00312.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Abraham’s loyalty</span> was tested

					migrated to Egypt, where their descendants were subsequently enslaved. Several
					generations later, when the Israelite population in Egypt had increased, God
					appointed Moses, an Israelite raised in the Egyptian court, to lead the people
					out of slavery and back to the land of Canaan. The Israelites’ escape
					from Egypt (the Exodus) involved many miracles: God struck the Egyptians with
					plagues that included afflicting them with boils and turning the Nile to blood,
					and he split the Red Sea so that the Israelites could pass through. With these
					miracles, God demonstrated his power, and his loyalty to the covenant with the
					patriarchs.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;After liberating the Israelites from Egypt, and before leading them into
					Canaan, God brought them to a mountain called Sinai, or Horeb. Moses ascended
					the mountain to speak to God, and a new covenant was established between God and
					the entire people of Israel. The covenant at Sinai recalled God’s
					salvation of Israel and promised the Israelites that they would be God’s
					treasured possession if they observed the commandments that he had given to
					Moses on Mount Sinai.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Torah, God spoke these commandments aloud from the top of
					Mount Sinai, which was covered by cloud and fire, while all the people of Israel
					listened from below. Tradition has it that these commandments were inscribed
					personally by God onto the two stone tablets that Moses brought down from the
					mountain, although the Torah is not consistently clear on this point. Moses
					broke the tablets in anger when he saw that the Israelites had built a false
					god, a golden calf, while he was on the summit. He returned to Mount Sinai to
					have a new set of stone tablets inscribed, and these were placed in a gilded
					chest called the Ark of the Covenant. The ark was equipped with poles so that it
					could be carried by the Israelites as they continued to Canaan.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-623"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00129.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">When the Israelites</span> fled Egypt during

					collection of writings composed mostly in the Hebrew language and written over
					the course of the first millennium BCE. With some variations in sequence and
					content, these same scriptures make up the Old Testament of the Christian
					Bible.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish tradition divides the Bible into three parts. The first, called the
					Torah or Pentateuch, describes God’s creation of the world and his
					covenant with Israel, and outlines the commandments that were imposed on the
					Israelites. Tradition attributes the Torah to Moses, but modern scholars believe
					that it was written by many authors over several centuries.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bible, Prophets, includes a narrative of Israelite
					history. This runs from the people’s entry into Canaan to the end of
					their kingdom, when their capital and temple are destroyed and their people
					exiled. It also contains the writings of the prophets.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The final part, called Writings, comprises a diverse collection of later
					literature.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-625" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The commandments</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The most famous commandments in the Sinai covenant are the Ten Commandments,
					or the Decalogue. The Decalogue comprises the most fundamental rules of
					Israel’s covenant. It prohibits the worship of other gods or the
					depiction of God in physical form; it says that each week the Israelites must
					observe a sacred day of rest, the Sabbath; and it prohibits certain actions,
					such as murder and adultery.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Decalogue, the Torah includes numerous laws that God is
					said to have conveyed to the Israelites indirectly through Moses, both at Sinai
					and on other occasions. These laws also form part of the covenant. According to
					a calculation in the Talmud (rabbinic interpretation of Jewish law) there are a
					total of 613 commandments in the Torah.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;They address many aspects of the Israelites’ life in Canaan. Some
					constitute what we would consider civil law, describing systems of government,
					regulating property disputes, and setting guidelines for dealing with cases of
					murder and theft, among other matters. Others relate to the construction of a
					sanctuary for worshipping God, and establish sacrificial rites to be performed
					by a hereditary priesthood. Still others direct the behavior of individual
					Israelites, instructing them on matters ranging from what they may eat, and whom
					they may marry, to the fair and charitable treatment of other people. Generally,
					the commandments aimed to establish a society that was just, by the standards of
					the day, and distinctive in its service of God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The final book of the Torah, Deuteronomy, describes a third covenant between
					God and Israel, established in the land of Moab (in modern-day Jordan) before
					the Israelites entered Canaan. Deuteronomy tells that God commanded Moses to
					make this additional covenant with the people of Israel. It took the form of a
					final address from Moses, who was to die before he entered the promised land.
					Moses recalled God’s salvation of Israel, relayed further commandments
					that God had given him at Sinai, and promised that God would bless the
					Israelites if they obeyed the commandments, and curse them if they disobeyed.
					The covenant at Moab reaffirmed the Israelites’ loyalty to their God and
					his commandments.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-626" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The covenant in practice</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In principle, traditional Jews consider the laws of the Torah eternally
					binding. However, the commandments have been subject to centuries of
					interpretation, and many are no longer applicable in practice. Certain laws
					pertaining to the rule of kings, for example, have not been applicable since the
					fall of the monarchy of Judah in the 6th century BCE, and the sacrificial rites
					have not been practiced by mainstream Jews since the Romans destroyed their
					temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. In addition, many of the Torah’s laws deal
					with agriculture and are considered binding only in Israel. In the present day,
					Jews maintain a range of approaches to the commandments and their
					interpretations. Traditional Jews observe the Sabbath, the festivals, and
					dietary laws (such as avoiding certain meats and not mixing meat and dairy), as
					well as other rules. But for many modern Jews, the essential laws are those that
					pertain to the love of one’s neighbor and the just treatment of other
					human beings. Progressive Jews often cite a dictum attributed to Rabbi Hillel
					the Elder on the Golden Rule: “That which is hateful to you, do not do to
					your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the
					explanation.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-627"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00177.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The rituals of Judaism</span>, such as the

					patriarch’s descendants as an inviolable gift. Yet it is stated elsewhere
					in the Bible that the Israelites’ hold on the land is conditional on
					observance of the commandments. This conditionality is said to explain why the
					Israelites were eventually conquered by their enemies and exiled from their
					land. Parts of the Torah include exile among the curses that would befall the
					Israelites if they violated the covenants at Sinai and Moab; many modern
					scholars believe that these passages were written in response to these
					events.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Torah asserts that God never abandoned his covenant with
					the patriarchs. While in exile, the Israelites had the opportunity to repent,
					and God led them back to their land, thereby upholding his covenant with
					Abraham. In this way the promise of the land, although conditional, remains
					eternal: the Israelites might lose the land for a time due to their sins, but
					they need not lose hope of returning.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-630" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The “Chosen People”</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Torah offers little in terms of explanation as to why God chose the
					patriarchs and their descendants, yet it emphasizes that by virtue of their
					covenantal relationship with him, the Israelites are privileged above other
					nations. The authors of the Bible did not view the Israelites as inherently
					superior to other people&mdash;on the contrary, they often describe them as
					sinful and unworthy&mdash;but they clearly perceived Israel’s status as
					special. As Jews came to believe that their god was the one God who ruled the
					whole world, their status as his chosen nation took on even greater
					significance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, Jews have struggled to understand why God chose them and
					what this choice implied about their place in the world. One ancient tradition
					suggests that, rather than God choosing Israel, Israel chose God. This tradition
					maintains that God offered the commandments to all the nations of the earth, but
					all except Israel rejected them, finding them too burdensome. In accordance with
					this view, the Israelites’ status is not a result of choice on
					God’s part, but a product of free will. At the same time, it seems to
					deny freedom of choice by holding individuals responsible for the decisions of
					their ancestors.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Jewish mystical traditions with origins in the Middle Ages suggest a
					different perspective, asserting that the souls of Jews were chosen at the time
					of creation and are qualitatively superior to those of non-Jews. However,
					prominent thinkers from the major modern denominations of Judaism (Modern
					Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform) emphatically reject any claims of essential
					difference between Jews and non-Jews. Modern Jewish thinkers tend to view the
					covenant instead as imposing a mission on Jews to live in accordance with
					God’s will and thereby convey God’s truth to the world. Some have
					suggested that Israel is not unique in having been chosen by God, and that other
					peoples may have been chosen to fulfill other missions. Some liberal Jews reject
					the idea of chosenness on the grounds that it presupposes superiority over other
					people and encourages ethnocentrism.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"The meaning of Jewish history revolves around the faithfulness of Israel

					parent to child through the maternal line; so the child of a Jewish mother is
					automatically Jewish and bound by the commandments. This inherited status cannot
					be forfeited: a Jew who does not observe the commandments has violated the
					covenant, but he or she remains a Jew. On the other hand, it is possible for a
					non-Jew to become Jewish through conversion. Under rabbinic law, a convert to
					Judaism must accept the Jewish commandments and be immersed in a ritual bath
					(and if male, be circumcised), at which point he, or she, assumes all the rights
					and duties of a Jew.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, conversion to Judaism involved a commitment to a strict regime
					of observance. Today, progressive Judaism places greater emphasis on individual
					autonomy in determining Jewish identity and its obligations. In both Reform
					Judaism in the US and Liberal Judaism in the UK, the children of Jewish fathers
					and non-Jewish mothers are accepted without formal conversion if they
					self-identify as Jewish.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of varying beliefs and practices, the concept of the covenant remains
					central to all streams of Judaism. It represents and defines the individual
					Jew’s purpose in the world, linking him or her to the Jewish people
					across the span of history, and to the Jewish God.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-632"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00083.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">How an individual joins the covenant</span>

					predominated. Around this time, the earliest clear articulation of monotheism in
					the Bible emerged, in a collection of writings known as Second Isaiah. It
					emphasizes that YHWH created, and rules over, the world alone. Israel’s

				ruled by kings. A ritual called anointing, in which oil was poured on the
				monarch’s head, functioned much like a coronation and served to indicate
				God’s election of the ruler, who was referred to as God’s anointed
				one, or in Hebrew, Messiah. Originally, the term Messiah was used for any anointed
				leader, but over time it came to refer to a specific ruler who would arise in the
				future and rescue Israel from its enemies, ushering in a golden age&mdash;the
				Messianic Era. Jewish tradition offers much speculation as to the events that would
				characterize the Messianic Era, but most agreed that it would be a period of
				brotherhood and glory on earth, when delicacies and miracles would be commonplace,
				swords would be beaten into plowshares, and the wolf would live with the
				lamb.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-643"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00229.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">Some traditions speculated that the Messiah would be an earthly ruler (with a
				close connection to God), others that he would be a heavenly figure appointed in a
				time before creation itself. Similarly, a number of traditions envisioned the
				Messianic Era to be part of the normal course of history, while for others it was a
				miraculous time when God’s spirit would reign on earth.</p><div id="calibre_link-644" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A Messiah from David’s line</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One of the first kings of the united monarchy of Israel and Judah was a man
					named David, who reigned from around 1005 to 965 BCE. According to the Bible,
					David was instrumental in uniting the people of Israel and defending them
					against the Philistines. The Bible relates that God loved David, referring to
					him as his son, and established an agreement, or covenant, with him, promising
					that his descendants would rule over Israel forever.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Babylonians conquered Judah in 586 BCE, exiling most of its
					inhabitants and destroying the temple, and David’s dynasty came to an
					end. The fall of the kingdom might have suggested that God had broken his
					covenant with David. Yet the people of Judah continued to hold out the hope
					that, some time in the future, a descendant of David would once again rule over
					Israel as God’s Messiah.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning

					predicted that a king descended from David would unite the two kingdoms and
					rescue them from their enemies. Although these prophecies were written in
					different periods and some referred to specific historical kings, later
					generations interpreted them as foretelling the advent of a future Messiah.
					After the Babylonian conquest, some prophets foretold that the people would
					eventually return to their homeland and rebuild their temple. A few envisioned
					that the nations of the world would one day recognize Israel’s God and
					come to worship him in Jerusalem. These visions of a glorious future were not
					unconditional, however. The prophets believed that Israel’s misfortunes
					were God’s punishment for the sins of the people and its leaders and that
					future restoration would only be possible if Israel repented.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-646" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Foreign rule</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The prophets’ visions were partly realized when the Persian king Cyrus
					the Great defeated the Babylonians and allowed many Jews to return to their
					homeland and rebuild the Temple. Indeed, Cyrus is addressed in the Bible as the
					“Lord’s Messiah.” However, a lengthy period of domination
					by foreign powers, including the Greek and Roman Empires, followed the return of
					the Jews to the homeland. During this time, they turned again to biblical
					prophecies about the Messiah and an age of national restoration.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jews drew on prophetic traditions that envisioned a great battle between
					the forces of good and evil, in which God would emerge triumphant and sinners
					would be punished. Jewish apocalyptic works of this period, which include the
					Dead Sea Scrolls, offer elaborate descriptions of this battle and the
					accompanying plagues and tribulations that would precede the advent of the
					Messiah: floods and earthquakes, the darkening of the sun and moon, and the
					falling of the stars from the sky. These events came to be known as the
					“birth pangs of the Messiah,” since for all the agony that they
					would cause they were simply a precursor of the Messianic Era, when evil would
					be banished from earth, the rule of oppressive empires would be swept away, and
					people could live free of distraction and crime.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one

					Qumran, on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. The scrolls are thought to be
					the writings of the Essenes&mdash;an ancient Jewish sect&mdash;that had been
					hidden when members of the sect fled the Romans during the Jewish revolt of
					66&ndash;70 CE. The Essenes rejected the priesthood that was then in control of
					the Jerusalem temple and formed a community in the desert, where they awaited
					the end times, apparently believing that they alone would be redeemed in the
					Messianic Era, which would usher in a new, purer temple and priesthood. The
					scrolls include the earliest known manuscripts of nearly every book in the
					Hebrew Bible as well as a wealth of later Jewish literature, and they have
					contributed greatly to our understanding of Jewish thought in the period.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-648" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Appearance of the Messiah</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Every so often throughout history, an exceptional individual would appear whom
					some people thought might be the Messiah. One such person was Jesus of Nazareth,
					known to his followers as Christ, from the Greek word for Messiah.
					Jesus’s followers, who became known as Christians, continued to believe
					that he was the Messiah after his execution by the Romans, but other Jews
					rejected this claim.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another messianic claimant was Simeon Bar Kokhba, who led a revolt against the
					Romans in 132 CE. His revolt was a colossal failure, which effectively brought
					an end to Jewish life in Jerusalem and the surrounding area. Those Jews who were
					not killed were dispersed throughout the Roman Empire, and many were sold into
					slavery.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of this, and other revolts against Roman rule and the loss, again,
					of the Jewish religious centre in Jerusalem brought new relevance to the
					prophecies from the Babylonian exile.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-649" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Resurrection and afterlife</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Messianic Era was originally envisioned by some traditions as a time of
					national restoration, when Israel would be redeemed and its oppressors would
					perish. Later, however, it was generally believed that it would also be a time
					of judgment for every person, living or dead, when the righteous would be
					rewarded and the wicked punished.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hebrew Bible says little about life after death. Most early biblical
					authors shared the ancient belief that the dead lived on in the underworld, but
					offered little detail on the subject. Many Jews came to believe that a
					person’s ultimate fate depended on his or her conduct in life. Some said
					that the righteous lived on in Paradise while the wicked were condemned to a
					place of torment, called Gehenna. Others emphasized a final judgment in the
					Messianic Era, when the dead would be resurrected. Both ideas persisted in
					Jewish belief, and both the Messianic Era and the individual afterlife are
					commonly referred to as the “World to Come.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-650"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00206.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Some Jewish thinkers maintain</span> the

					belief. Many leaders state that if Jews, as a group, embrace God and obey his
					commandments, they can hasten the Messiah’s arrival. Yet the idea of the
					Messiah has mostly flourished when Jews have been oppressed, and the relative
					freedom of Jews in much of the modern world has lessened the sense of urgency of
					the hope for national restoration. The Reform movement, in particular, rejected
					the ideas of a messianic king, a return to the Jewish homeland, and the
					rebuilding of the temple, although aspects of these beliefs have been
					reevaluated over the years. The one feature of messianism that remains central
					in all streams of Judaism is, however, the belief that humankind&mdash;and the
					Jewish people in particular&mdash;has the ability to bring about a better
					future through righteous action.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"King Messiah, the Son of Man, will arise in the future and will restore

					Jacob’s 12 sons grew into the 12 tribes of Israel (Israelites), occupying
					an area roughly equivalent to the modern territory of Israel. In the late 10th
					century BCE, the Israelites were divided into two kingdoms&mdash;the southern
					tribes formed the Kingdom of Judah, while the northern tribes formed the Kingdom
					of Israel. These two kingdoms were subsequently conquered and broken
					up&mdash;Israel by the Assyrians in 722 BCE, and Judah by the Babylonians in
					586 BCE. However, the people of Judah endured as a distinct group with a
					distinct religion. From this point, they were called “Jews” and
					their religion “Judaism,” although they still thought of
					themselves as Israelites.

				teachings, which he passed on to the people of <a href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre2">Israel</a>. Many of these are recorded in the first five books
				of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, but some Jews also believe that Moses received
				additional teachings (transmitted verbally to the community’s leaders, and
				then from generation to generation), which became known as the Oral Law. This Oral
				Law included additional details about, and interpretations of, the biblical laws.
				From the 2nd century CE, Jewish rabbis (a word meaning “scholars” or
				“teachers”) set out to record the Oral Law. The result was a large new
				body of literature. Many of the rabbis’ writings are collected in a set of
				books called the Talmud which, for observant Jews, is the most important and
				authoritative religious text after the Bible itself.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-655"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00111.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">Part of the reason the Oral Law is important is that the Bible’s laws are
				frequently ambiguous. For example, the Bible prohibits working on the Sabbath, but
				it does not explain what kind of work is prohibited. The Talmud resolves this
				ambiguity by specifying 39 types of activity (including building, cooking, and
				writing) that are forbidden.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to recording the laws given to Moses, the Talmud includes extensive
				discussions between rabbis over interpretation. These discussions are considered
				part of the Oral Law too, because the authority to interpret the laws was handed
				down through Moses.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Each page of the Talmud is designed to reflect this debate: the earliest writings,
				or Mishnah, setting out the law, are surrounded by the discussions, or Gemara, so
				the book can be read a series of conversations between rabbis.</p><div id="calibre_link-656" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Acceptance of the Talmud</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The concept of an oral law has not been universally accepted among Jews. Prior
					to the writing of the Talmud, the doctrine of the Oral Law was promulgated by a
					Jewish sect called the Pharisees. However, two sects&mdash;the Karaites and the
					Sadducees&mdash;rejected this doctrine. The Karaites originated around the 8th
					century in Baghdad and (unlike the Sadducees) still exist today. Karaites have
					their own traditions for interpreting the Bible, but they do not believe that
					any teachings were given to Moses besides those in the biblical text.
					Nonetheless, other branches of Judaism accept the Talmud as a sacred text, and
					Orthodox Jews continue to trace its origins to the Oral Law given to Moses by
					God. Many modern Jews do not take this idea literally, but rather view the
					Talmud as part of a living tradition that preserves and interprets Jewish law
					for every generation and encourages theological debate.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-657"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00115.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The primary purpose</span> of the Talmud is to

					Jerusalem Talmud, which was compiled in the 4th century CE in the Land of
					Israel, and the Babylonian Talmud, which was compiled c.500 CE in Babylonia
					(modern-day Iraq). Although there are many similarities between the two
					versions, the Babylonian Talmud, which is more than 6,000 pages in extent, is
					generally considered to be more authoritative and is used more widely by
					students of Judaism. The Jerusalem Talmud was never completed due to the

				Jewish religion. Yet the idea that God is one may be understood in a variety of
				ways: that is, God could be the greatest of many divine beings, or God could be a
				single being composed of several different elements. In the Middle Ages, a number of
				Jewish philosophers in the Muslim sphere of influence sought to demonstrate that the
				oneness of God, properly understood, excluded all of these other
				possibilities.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-660"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00350.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">Moses Maimonides was a particularly influential philosopher of this school. He
				explained the Jewish tenet of monotheism in terms of the classical Greek
				philosophical doctrine that God is “simple”&mdash;that is, not
				composed of parts or properties.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s oneness, according to Maimonides, is different from the oneness of
				any other being: he is a single, unique, indivisible entity; he is also beyond human
				understanding and description, and therefore cannot be given specific
				attributes.</p><div id="calibre_link-661" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">God cannot be categorized</h2></div><p class="calibre14">God, Maimonides argued, is not “one of a species”&mdash;he is
					not a member of a group of beings that share certain characteristics. Three
					different men, for example, are each individuals, but they share the attribute
					of maleness and therefore belong to the category of males. God, on the other
					hand, has no attributes, and therefore cannot belong to a category of beings,
					divine or otherwise.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s oneness also differs from that of a body, which is divisible.
					This means that God is not like a physical object, which can be broken into
					parts. But Maimonides went further, and argued that God is also intellectually
					indivisible: he cannot have any attributes (as defined by Aristotle), as he
					would then consist of both his essence and his attributes. If God were eternal,
					for example, there would effectively be two gods: God and God’s
					eternity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maimonides’ belief that God has no attributes is a product of a school
					of thought called negative theology, which maintains that it is inaccurate to
					characterize God in any affirmative way. Given the limits of human language, we
					may describe God as eternal, but in truth we can only affirm that God is not
					non-eternal: that is, his essence is beyond comprehension. Maimonides included
					the doctrine of God’s oneness among his 13 essential principles of Jewish
					faith, which also include such concepts as God’s antiquity and the belief
					that the Torah comes from the mouth of God. Many regard these principles as the
					fundamental elements of Jewish belief.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-662"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00260.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">According to Maimonides</span>, God existed

					into a Jewish family. His childhood was rich in cross-cultural influences: he
					was educated in both Hebrew and Arabic, and his father, a rabbinic judge, taught
					him Jewish law within the context of Islamic Spain. His family fled Spain when
					the Berber Almohad dynasty came to power in 1148, and lived nomadically for 10
					years until they settled first in Fez (now in Morocco) and then in Cairo.
					Maimonides began training as a physician due to his family’s financial
					problems; his skill led to a royal appointment within only a few years. He also
					worked as a rabbinic judge, but this was an activity for which he thought it

				Talmud (a compendium of rabbinic interpretations), a body of mystical knowledge
				known as kabbalah. Originally an oral tradition, it was collected in the Zohar
				(“Divine Splendor”) in the late 13th century in Spain. The Zohar and
				its kabbalistic ideas took on a special significance for exiled Jews&mdash;in
				particular for the scholars of Safed in Palestine&mdash;after their expulsion from
				Iberia (present-day Spain, Portugal, and Andorra) in the 1490s. Among them was the
				teacher Isaac Luria, whose interpretation of the Zohar gave a unique description of
				the creation that was applicable to the experience of Jews in exile. It provided an
				explanation of good and evil, and the way to redemption.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-666"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00166.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre11">In Luria’s interpretation, before the creation only God existed. In order
				to make space to create the world, he contracted or withdrew into himself (<i class="calibre4">tzimtzum</i>): a form of self-imposed exile for the sake of
				creation. A divine light streamed into the created space in the shape of 10
					<i class="calibre4">sefirot</i>&mdash;emanations of the divine
				attributes of God. Adam Kadmon (meaning primordial man) formed vessels to contain
				the <i class="calibre4">sefirot</i>. But the vessels were too delicate to
				hold the divine light: the upper three were damaged, and the lower seven completely
				destroyed, scattering the divine light. This destruction of the vessels (known as
					<i class="calibre4">shevirat ha-kelim</i> or <i class="calibre4">shevirah</i>) upset the process of creation and divided the universe
				into those elements that assisted, and those that resisted, the creation: good and
				evil, and the upper and lower worlds.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This damage can be repaired, Luria explained, by detaching the holy sparks of
				divine light to which the forces of evil in the lower world are clinging, and
				restoring them to their source in the upper world: a process of <i class="calibre4">tikkun olam</i>&mdash;repairing the world. The
				responsibility for this rests on the Jewish people, who rescue a holy spark each
				time they obey a holy commandment, and pass one back to universal evil when they
				sin. Until all the divine sparks are reunited in the world of the good, there can be
				no redemption, and humanity will live in cosmic exile.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Luria did not leave a record of his interpretation of kabbalah, his
				esoteric teachings were preserved by his followers. After his death, his ideas
				spread quickly throughout Europe. Because of the rational, comprehensive nature of
				Lurianic kabbalah, kabbalistic study became a mainstay of Jewish thought, and in the
				18th century it formed the basis for the <a href="#calibre_link-105" class="calibre2">Hasidic

				Judaism.</p><p class="calibre11">The movement emerged from the Jewish communities of Central and Eastern Europe
				during the 18th century. These communities were often small and isolated, and their
				lifestyle was very different from that of urban Jews living elsewhere. Mainstream

				and its followers should be allowed freedom of conscience as citizens of the country
				in which they lived; conversely, being a Jew did not imply belonging to a separate

				Previously, Jews had been restricted in where they could live, and had been barred
				from entering universities and the professions, but the force of European
				Enlightenment led to them being given equal rights as citizens. Yiddish-speaking
				Jews learned German, became part of the modern world, and began to feel the freedom
				of individuality. Many Jews started looking to secular education&mdash;rather than
				Jewish tradition&mdash;as a means of achieving their potential. Progressive
				Judaism, which began with the Reform movement in Germany, was a response to these
				changes, to modernity, and to the new freedoms.</p><p class="calibre11">The earliest and most visible reforms emerged in Berlin and Hamburg. They
				concerned the synagogue service: the sermon would be given in German, and men and
				women would sit together rather than being segregated. More radically, the impact of
				modern biblical scholarship led some Jews to question the divine authority of the
				biblical texts, and the traditions that had kept them apart from society. The
				authority of the classical rabbis was now seen to be a function of its time, and was
				also called into question.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some, faced with this new insight and the opportunities it gave rise to, abandoned
				their Judaism in favor of secular nationalism. Others sought instead to modernize
				Judaism in the light of historical, academic study of the religion (<i class="calibre4">Wissenschaft des Judentums</i>). The pace of change was too
				rapid for some, and various groups seceded from the community, perhaps to be served
				by a more orthodox rabbi.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-674"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00218.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"The Talmud speaks with the ideology of its own time, and for that time it was

					Reform prayer book in Hamburg in 1818. Scholars and rabbis, such as Abraham
					Geiger, now began to question key theological assumptions. Geiger recognized
					historical precedents for modifying Jewish tradition to adjust to new
					conditions, and suggested that some observances could be altered to be
					compatible with modern ways of living.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Judaism’s traditional theology was abandoned too. The German
					reformers no longer felt that they could pray for a messiah in the form of one
					person who would return the people to the Land of Israel to rebuild the Temple
					and restore the priestly sacrificial cult. Instead, they replaced the idea of
					the messiah with one of the messianic ideal&mdash;peace for every nation on
					earth&mdash;that every Jew would work to bring about. Even more daring was the
					new idea that the Jews were no longer in exile but could realize their Jewish
					destiny as citizens of a modern nation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This dream was in some ways short-lived. For many there was no real social
					integration without conversion to Christianity, and the Holocaust of Nazi
					Germany and World War II made clear the limits of hope for an enlightened
					humanity.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"A minority is always compelled to think. That is the blessing of being in
						the minority."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Leo Baeck, Progressive Rabbi</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-676" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Religious autonomy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">There is a tension in progressive Judaism, as in other strands of the religion
					today, between being part of a nation and community (universalism), and having a
					unique destiny (particularism). What differs for progressive Jews is probably
					the modern focus on autonomy&mdash;their freedom to determine how they live
					their Jewish lives. Progressive Judaism teaches that responsible autonomy
					requires making choices based on ethics, Jewish education, and commitment to the
					Jewish people, with reverence for the past and a commitment to the
					future.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish theologies continue to develop. Although monotheism remains a
					fundamental tenet of the faith, progressive Judaism’s theology extends
					the notion of a “commanding” God to the idea of an ongoing
					relationship with God, in which each Jew exercises his or her individual
					freedom. The mitzvot, or commandments, are expressions of this
					relationship.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-677" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The concept of monism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Another group of progressive thinkers believes God to be an inseparable part
					of the self, rather than an external divinity. Some have absorbed the views of
					Jewish mystics, who understand the entire creation as taking place within God,
					which means that everything <i class="calibre4">is</i> God.
					Monotheism, or the belief in one god, becomes monism, meaning that there is only
					oneness, and that this oneness <i class="calibre4">is</i> God. These
					theological transformations within progressive Judaism mean that the role of the
					individual and the commandments can no longer be seen as fixed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the newly defined relationship between individual, God, and the
					commandments, Jews in the progressive movement also came to review conventional
					interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. They now regard it as a composite text from
					different historical periods&mdash;a written record of a human encounter with
					the divine, rather than the recorded words of God, meaning that its authority is
					not straightforward. Since God’s intentions were not fixed once in time,
					the revelation could be considered continuous.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way, progressive Judaism recognizes the impact of history and
					human authorship on the development of Jewish law, or Halachah, which is
					traditionally rooted in biblical commandments and the rulings of classical
					rabbis. Halachah has undergone transformation in both progressive and Orthodox
					communities. One progressive view sees Halachah as undergoing continual
					adaptation to respond to ethical and practical problems in the contemporary
					Jewish world. This view takes account of modern scientific developments, such as
					stem cell research, and is strongly guided by contemporary ethics, tackling
					issues such as care at the end of life. Other progressives describe a
					post-Halachic Judaism, perhaps identifying more closely with the ancient Hebrew
					prophets and an ethically driven Prophetic Judaism.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-678"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000123.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Orthodox Jews believe that</span> the Torah
							was given by God to Moses at Mount Sinai. Progressive Jews, however,
							believe it was written by human beings under divine inspiration, and
							should be responded to accordingly.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-679" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Rituals and observances</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Modern approaches to ritual practice also reflect the idea of Judaism’s
					continuing evolution, stipulating that divine authority is not limited to the
					Torah. The Sabbath (Shabbat), for instance, is considered a day of rest and
					holiness distinct from the working week. Progressive Jews respect the Sabbath,
					and are still likely to begin it with lighting Shabbat candles on Friday
					evening, although not all will insist that this be done before sunset, if it
					occurs very early. They may also reject the traditional prohibition on driving a
					motor car to the synagogue on Shabbat.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-680" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dietary laws</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In matters of <i class="calibre4">kashrut</i> (dietary law), some
					progressive Jews might dismiss all the rules as antiquated, while others might
					avoid the meats that are forbidden in the Torah but not concern themselves with
					the later rabbinic prohibitions concerning the separation of meat and milk
					products and the utensils used in the preparation of each. Some might focus
					instead on the discipline of <i class="calibre4">kashrut</i> as a way
					of expressing consciousness of what they eat, perhaps extending this to eating
					organic, fair-trade products or food with low food miles. Others might view
					vegetarianism as a proper or suitable (from the meaning of the Hebrew word
						“<i class="calibre4">kashrut</i>”) diet and
					therefore as a modern, progressive expression of the observance.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-681"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00172.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Progressive communities</span> mark the time

					prayers have been added. Progressive services retain the framework and core
					prayers, but remove some repetition; prayers, and their translations, reflect a
					reworking of concepts that do not accord with progressive beliefs, such as the
					resurrection of the dead, the restoration of the temple, and animal sacrifices.
					Many progressive liturgies avoid feudal and gendered language both for God and
					the community, referring, for example, to the Eternal instead of the Lord,
					ancestors instead of forefathers, and including the biblical matriarchs along
					with the patriarchs.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Novel liturgical compositions may sometimes be included, such as poetry or
					prayers of interfaith understanding, and a shorter weekly passage from the Torah
					read. In many congregations, services are conducted in Hebrew as well as the
					vernacular, and are often accompanied by music. Progressive Jews observe the
					Hebrew festival dates given in the Torah, as is the practice of all Jews in the
					Land of Israel. This is in contrast to Orthodox and Conservative Jews in the
					diaspora, who traditionally extend the duration of festivals by a day, as was
					the custom outside Israel before the Hebrew calendar was fixed in 358 CE.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and men in progressive communities generally enjoy full equality in
					communal leadership (including ordination as rabbis) and in ritual life, whether
					in the synagogue or home. Girls therefore celebrate their ritual adulthood at
					the age of 13 (becoming bat mitzvah) just as boys do (becoming bar mitzvah) by
					reading publicly from the Torah and even leading the congregation in
					prayer.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-683" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Progressive Judaism today</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The core ideals of German Reform Judaism took root, and led to the growth of
					progressive Jewish communities in most countries in the world today. In the UK,
					Reform Judaism and Liberal Judaism emerged, and, with German Jewish immigration
					to the US, an American Reform movement came into being there. This gave rise to
					other progressive communities in the US, such as Reconstructionist Judaism, and
					Conservative Judaism, which is modern in its theology but traditional in its
					practices. Other progressive forms of Judaism are found worldwide, including in
					Israel, where the faith tends toward a more traditional expression of Judaism
					than in the diaspora.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent worldwide resurgence of interest in Jewish learning across the
					religious spectrum has led to an engagement with the study of classical texts in
					Hebrew for their spiritual, literary, and ethical value. Today’s
					believers may draw from a wide range of Jewish and secular influences, and are

				assimilation, until he experienced extreme anti-Semitic feeling in France, an

				were inevitable: Jews tended to gravitate to places where they were not likely to be
				persecuted, but once they had immigrated in significant numbers to these places,
				anti-Jewish feeling arose, and persecution followed. Similarly, even where Jews had
				tried to blend in with the local community and behave as loyal citizens, they were
				still treated as aliens and driven into isolation. He concluded that the solution to
				these problems lay not in assimilation, but in the large-scale separation of Jewish
				people into one place. Anti-Semitism could not be defeated or eradicated, but could
				be avoided by establishing a Jewish nation state.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-687"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"I consider the Jewish question neither a social nor a religious one… It

					Palestine. This proposal marked the beginning of modern Zionism as a political
					movement, rather than a theological aspiration. The following year, 1897, Herzl
					set up an international conference, the First Zionist Congress, at which it
					became clear that the political will for a Jewish state existed, and was
					achievable if Jews in sufficent numbers were to put pressure on the

				were finally admitted into rabbinical schools in the 1980s. Today, only Orthodox

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-5"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Christianity takes its name from the Greek word <i class="calibre4">christós</i>, a translation of the Hebrew word for
				messiah, or anointed one. This title was given to Jesus by a Jewish sect who
				considered him to be the Messiah&mdash;the savior prophesied in the Tanakh, the
				Hebrew Bible&mdash;and the Son of God in human form. Christians believe that
				Jesus’s arrival on earth heralded a New Covenant or New Testament with God
				that followed the Old Testament covenants between God and the Jewish people.</p><p class="calibre11">The main beliefs of Christianity are based on the life and teachings of Jesus as
				recorded by his followers in the 1st century CEin the Gospels (meaning “good
				news”) and the Epistles (or letters) of the New Testament.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians give great significance to the story of Jesus’s crucifixion,
				resurrection, and ascension to heaven. It is the central belief of Christianity that
				Jesus suffered, died, and was buried, before being resurrected from the
				dead&mdash;in order to grant salvation to those who believe in him&mdash;and that
				he then ascended to heaven to rule alongside God the Father.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit in this belief is the acceptance that Jesus was, as the Son of God, God
				incarnate, both human and divine, and not merely a prophet. This led to the concept
				of the Trinity, that the one God exists in three distinct forms&mdash;the Father,
				the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of Jesus also provides a framework for the rituals of Christian worship,
				the most important of which are known as sacraments. Especially significant are the
				sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist&mdash;the taking of bread and wine, as
				Jesus instructed his followers at the Last Supper. Others include confirmation, holy
				orders (the ordination of ministers), confession, the anointing of the sick, and
				matrimony&mdash;although not all of these are accepted by every Christian
				denomination.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-698"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000369.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-699" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Persecution to adoption</h2></div><p class="calibre14">From its beginnings in Roman Judea to its status as the religion with most
					adherents in the world today, Christianity has shaped the culture of much of
					Western civilization. The early Christians were persecuted by both Jewish
					authorities and the Roman Empire, and many were put to death. Nevertheless, the
					faith persisted under the leadership of the early Church. Gradually,
					Christianity came to be tolerated by Roman leaders, and, after the Council of
					Nicea, where a universal Christian creed was agreed, it was eventually adopted
					as the official religion of the Roman Empire in 380 CE.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, Christianity became a powerful force in the political and
					cultural life of Europe and the Middle East. Its influence spread rapidly and
					produced such thinkers as Augustine of Hippo, a convert to Christianity, who
					integrated Greek philosophical ideas into the doctrine. With the decline and
					fall of the Roman Empire, power in Europe moved to the popes, who were
					considered the natural successors of the apostles and the first bishops. In the
					11th century, a split in the Church over papal authority&mdash;the so-called
					Great Schism&mdash;divided Christianity into two distinct branches, the Western
					(Roman Catholic) Church and the Eastern (Orthodox) Church. Christianity also
					faced a challenge from the Islamic Empire from the 8th century on, and, through
					the 12th and 13th centuries, fought a series of Crusades to recapture Jerusalem
					from the Muslims.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-700" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Church power</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Catholic Church retained its influence in Europe, and its dogma dominated
					learning and culture throughout the Middle Ages. Philosophical and scientific
					ideas were often seen as heretical, and even the great Thomas Aquinas found his
					application of Aristotelian reasoning to Christian theology initially condemned:
					only centuries after his death was it adopted as official Catholic dogma.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Renaissance of the 14th and 15th centuries heralded a new challenge to the
					authority of the Church in the form of humanism and the beginnings of a
					scientific Golden Age. The revival of interest in classical learning prompted
					criticism of the Catholic Church, and the Protestant Reformation was triggered
					by publication of Martin Luther’s 95 Theses in 1517. Protestantism began
					to flourish in northern Europe and paved the way for new Christian
					denominations. Of the roughly 2.2 billion Christians worldwide today (around a
					third of the world’s population), more than half are Catholic, roughly
					one third are Protestant, and the remainder are Orthodox.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				end to a century of Judean self-rule and turning the region into a Roman client
				state. Rome was the last in a long line of invading forces, which stretched back
				over 500 years and included Babylon, Persia, Greece, Egypt, and Syria. This repeated
				loss of sovereignty had dented national pride and caused religious consternation,
				challenging the Jewish concept of themselves as God’s chosen people.</p><p class="calibre11">Key Jewish religious texts from previous centuries (such as the prophetic work of
				Isaiah) had promised that a time would come when Israel’s God would be the
				acknowledged ruler of the whole world. He would bring in a system of justice and
				peace for all through his appointed representative, known as the Messiah (meaning
				anointed one). This would be the climax of world history, so the prophecy said: the
				end of the old, existing era and the beginning of God’s era. However, given
				the new Roman occupation, this kingdom of God seemed a distant dream.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-702"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00320.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-703" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Announcing a new world</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In around the late 20s CE, a Jewish rabbi called Jesus began a brief, but
					extraordinary, ministry throughout Roman-occupied Israel. Jesus’s core
					message was that God’s long-awaited kingdom was now arriving. Some people
					who heard his message thought that he intended to raise an army to expel the
					Romans. However, his goal was not Israel’s political independence, but
					the liberation of the entire world from all evil. According to a collection of
					Jesus’s teachings, known as the Sermon on the Mount (found in the Gospel
					of St. Matthew in the New Testament), Jesus announced that God’s kingdom
					now held sway over both heaven and earth, and that under this new rule the
					distorted values of human kingdoms would be overturned. God’s kingdom, he
					said, belonged not to the greedy, the self-assured, and the warriors, but to the
					poor, the meek, and the peacemakers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-704"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00371.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Preaching to his band</span> of disciples,

							God’s kingdom had become a reality.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-705" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">All are welcome</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Jesus’s message was manifested in his actions. Centuries earlier, the
					Jewish prophet Isaiah had said that when God’s kingdom came, there would
					be wonderful miracles of healing: the blind would be able to see, and the deaf
					able to hear that God was now king, and the lame would jump for joy. The
					biblical accounts of Jesus’s ministry are full of stories of healings
					just like these. In addition, Jesus said there was no longer any barrier to
					entering God’s kingdom. Until that time, the Jewish faith had viewed
					non-Jews as beyond salvation, along with those people who failed to adhere to
					God’s laws (sinners), but Jesus said that even these groups would be
					welcomed into the kingdom. Jesus demonstrated the forgiveness of sinners by
					sharing meals&mdash;one of the most intimate and meaningful of Jewish
					activities&mdash;with social outcasts and religious renegades. The future was
					likened to a banquet prepared by God, to which people from all over the world
					would be invited.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But people were confused: wasn’t the kingdom of God supposed to be the
					climax of world history? If so, why did the world not end with Jesus’s
					announcement? The answer that Jesus gave them was that the kingdom would not
					arrive all at once, as most people had expected. In one of his many parables
					(stories used to illustrate his message) he compared God’s kingdom to the
					yeast in a batch of dough. In another, he described the kingdom as acting like
					seeds sown in the ground. Both yeast and seeds take time to produce results,
					growing almost imperceptibly, but are slowly and surely at work.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-706"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00323.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Jesus’s miracles</span>, such as the
							healing of the blind, affirmed that, just as Jesus went among the poor
							and the outcast, so God invited everyone, regardless of status, into his
							kingdom.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-707" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A new religion</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Jesus invited those who heard him to allow God’s kingdom and its values
					into their own lives without delay. He taught that the kingdom of God is both
					now, and not yet, here, that it has begun and continues to grow whenever people
					choose to live by the rule of God, embracing his values and experiencing healing
					and forgiveness. However, Jesus also acknowledged that there would be a future
					moment when, at the climactic end of the present world order, God’s rule
					would triumph over all other kingdoms. When this day of judgment arrived, it
					would be too late to decide to be part of God’s new world. This gave his
					message a note of urgency. People needed to make a decision now; far from being
					a distant dream, the end had already begun.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that Jesus marked the beginning of the end led directly to the
					separation of Christianity from its Jewish roots. The early followers of Jesus
					claimed that they no longer had to wait to discover who God’s Messiah
					would be, because Jesus was that Messiah&mdash;the one God had appointed to
					bring his kingdom to earth. However, Jesus’s opponents refused to believe
					this and decided to silence him by killing him. When Jesus’s followers
					did not give up their beliefs even after Jesus died, and in fact enlarged on
					them&mdash;by claiming that God had confounded Jesus’s opponents by
					raising him from the dead&mdash;it became clear that their faith, led by a
					figure who could not be conquered by death, was something new and distinct
					within the catalog of religions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earliest days, Christianity has been defined by the conviction that
					Jesus’s ministry was the beginning of the end. One of the key prayers of
					Christianity, the Lord’s Prayer, taught by Jesus himself, asks that
					God’s kingdom come on earth “as it is in heaven.” In
					offering this prayer, Christians are asking for the earthly advent of
					God’s kingdom now, even as they wait for it to arrive in fullness at the
					end of present world history.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of

					“kingdom of God” or “kingdom of heaven” as a purely
					spiritual realm that leaves the physical world unaffected. But in the early 20th
					century, New Testament scholars began to take a new interest in the Jewish
					context of Jesus’s ministry, and since then Jesus’s message about
					the kingdom of God has had an especially prominent place in Christian theology.
					By paying closer attention to the background of Jesus’s original message,
					the political and economic implications of the arrival of God’s kingdom
					have become clearer. Christians now believe that the kingdom occurs wherever
					present reality and its values are transformed by the rule of God, a belief that
					has inspired many Christians to champion movements for social change; for
					example, Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement in the United States,
					Gustavo Gutiérrez and the liberation of the poor in South America, and
					Desmond Tutu and the end of apartheid in South Africa.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"The time is fulfilled. God’s kingdom is arriving! Turn around and

					in theology by the term inaugurated eschatology. Eschatology is a word that
					itself evolved from two Greek words meaning “last” and
					“study,” and it refers to the study of the end of things, or the
					end of all things&mdash;the end of the world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Christians, Jesus’s message about God’s kingdom gives
					Christianity an inaugurated eschatology: the end of all things was inaugurated
					(begun but not completed) by his message. The fact that the presence of
					God’s kingdom today in the lives of Christians can still only be called
					the beginning of the end is a reminder that the Christian faith still looks
					toward a final, definitive action by God.</p></div><div class="calibre18"></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-711"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">JESUS OF NAZARETH</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-712"><img alt="" src="images/00280.jpeg" class="calibre20" /></div><p class="intro">Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the Roman province of Judea, in around 4 BCE,

				does our entire being disintegrate like our bodies? Many thinkers in the ancient
				world considered these questions and the issues arising from them. Greek thought was
				influential in the Roman Empire, and Plato’s ideas on these subjects gained
				widespread support in the centuries before Jesus’s birth, death, and
				resurrection.</p><p class="calibre11">Plato’s thinking was dualist. He believed there were two parts to human
				life: the physical body, which constantly changes and eventually dies; and the
				thinking soul, which exists eternally.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third century CE, the theologian Origen of Alexandria explained elements of
				the Christian message using terms from Greek philosophy. In particular, he developed
				Plato’s thinking into a Christian understanding of the soul that would last
				for centuries.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-721"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00042.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-722" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Only souls matter</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Like Plato, Origen believed that while human bodies are mortal and die, souls
					are immortal. For Origen, however, the immortality of the soul is a direct
					implication of God’s unchanging nature. Since God cannot change, the
					relationship he has with humans cannot end once their bodies disintegrate.
					Therefore there must be a part of the human that does not die, and this is the
					soul. A typical Platonist, Origen thought the soul was far more important than
					the body, which was a distraction from a spiritual life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-723"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00328.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">According to Origen,</span> the soul is the

					salvation from that moment on. Unlike the Platonists, the writers of the Hebrew
					Bible had not separated the soul from the body. If there was going to be any
					life after death at all, then a person’s body would need to be raised
					from the dead to go along with its soul. Jesus’s bodily resurrection from
					the dead showed that this was possible for those who believed in him. However,
					after Origen, less emphasis was placed on bodily resurrection, and much
					Christian teaching focused exclusively on the state of the soul before death and
					its fate after death. The souls of those who had rejected God were considered to
					be spiritually dead, and would live out their immortality in hell. However, the
					souls of those who had embraced Jesus’s message would ascend to a state
					of perfection with God in heaven.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-725" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A modern perspective</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Recent Christian thinkers have suggested that Origen relied too heavily on
					Platonism. A growing movement in Christian theology rejects dualism (the
					separation of body and soul), teaching instead that the life of the soul after
					death is possible only if God also resurrects a person’s body. Another
					widespread belief today is that of conditional immortality: immortality is only
					given to those who have believed in Jesus, and not to everyone.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"…the soul, having a substance and life of its own, shall, after its

					an eight-volume defense of Christianity against one of its critics, the

				distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) yet remain only one God. However,
				this idea, which is known as the doctrine of the Trinity, is a central plank in
				Christian theology, setting its understanding of God apart from other
				religions.</p><p class="calibre11">A standardized way of speaking about God, known as the doctrine of the Trinity,
				was settled upon by members of the early Church some 300 years after the death of
				Jesus. A range of ideas had emerged as the faith spread across the Roman Empire and
				beyond, so Church leaders articulated the doctrine as a response.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-729"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00240.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-730" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Rooted in Judaism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The roots of Christianity are in Judaism&mdash;the religion into which Jesus

					monotheistic, so is Christianity&mdash;Christians, like Jews, believe in just
					one God. But how could the first Christians claim to be monotheistic if they
					worshipped both Jesus as God and the God whom Jesus called Father? And how did
					this relate to the Spirit, whom Jesus said he would send, so that God’s
					presence would remain with Christians? Since the Spirit was also worshipped as
					God, did this mean that Christians were tri-theists (believing in three gods)
					rather than monotheists? The doctrine of the Trinity is an attempt to answer
					these tricky questions, with the assertion that Christians worship one God in
					three persons.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-731"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00144.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The Trinity</span> is portrayed as Son,

					his ministry. The implication of this teaching was clear, Jesus was God’s
					Son and he claimed the same divinity as God. He also spoke about his close
					relationship to the Spirit: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send
					in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have
					said to you” (John 14:26). Jesus again hinted at the shared divinity of
					the three persons of God in the Great Commission, a statement in which he
					commanded his followers to “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
					in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew
					28:19). In accordance with these teachings, the early Christians worshipped
					Jesus. After all, he had made it possible for everyone who believed to be part
					of God’s family (a status previously only accorded to the Jews),
					forgiving their past rebellion against God and assuring them that they would be
					included when God brought peace and justice to the world. Jesus had said and
					done things that only God could say and do: as he had implied during his life,
					Jesus was God.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"We believe in one God, the Father almighty…and in one Lord Jesus
						Christ, the only begotten Son of God…and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord

					Empire. With such a wide appeal, it was increasingly difficult to establish a
					uniform understanding of the faith. The Emperor Constantine saw the problems
					these differences were causing, so he called a council of Church bishops from
					all over his empire to meet in Nicea in 325 CE. He encouraged the bishops to
					agree a statement of faith&mdash;in particular, to define the nature of the
					Trinity&mdash;that would be acceptable to all Christians. This creed would be
					recited in churches and would help steer Christians away from heretical beliefs,
					especially those of the <a href="#calibre_link-12" class="calibre2">Arians</a>. In 381 CE, Emperor Theodosius called another council, this
					time in Constantinople. The 325 CE creed was clarified and expanded, resulting
					in the Nicene Creed, which is still recited today in churches all over the
					world.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-734" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Similar but not the same</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The doctrine of the Trinity emerged in response to a series of other answers
					that the early Christians judged to be wrong, or heretical. One such idea was
					Arianism&mdash;the theology of Arius (c.250&ndash;336 CE), a Christian leader
					in Alexandria, Egypt&mdash;which emphasized monotheism so strongly that it
					denied the deity of the Son and, by implication, of the Spirit. For Arius, only
					the Father was truly God. Although the Son was to be honored for having the
					closest possible relationship with the Father, the Son was still only a
					representative of the Father’s deity, and did not share that
					deity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This tallied with some aspects of accepted Christian thinking: one of the
					essential characteristics of God was that he was uncreated&mdash;he had no
					beginning as well as no end to his life. The Arians therefore argued that since
					children have to be born, the Son of God could not possess all the essential
					characteristics of God, because, as a Son, he must have been born. An Arian
					dictum about the Son of God stated that “there was once when he was
					not”: there must have been a time before the Son of God was born, when
					God existed without him. In their view, this logic proved that only the Father
					was truly God. One of the words used to describe the Son was <i class="calibre4">homoiousios</i>, which is a Greek term meaning
					“of similar substance.” The Son was “of similar
					substance” to the Father, but not the same.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arians had preserved monotheism, but at the expense of the Son and the
					Spirit. This was potentially disastrous for the Christian faith, since the
					central claim of Christians was that through the life, death, and resurrection
					of Jesus&mdash;the Son of God&mdash;God himself had saved them. If the Son of
					God was not truly God, then how could they be sure that God really did want to
					forgive them their sins and receive them in his kingdom?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Council of Nicea in 325 CE, Arianism was condemned when its central
					tenet, that the Son was <i class="calibre4">homoiousios</i> with the
					Father, was rejected. Instead, Jesus was declared to be <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>, which means “of the same substance.”
					This distinction made all the difference&mdash;it was agreed that the Son
					utterly shares the Father’s deity. Consequently, it was accepted that the
					Son had no beginning&mdash;God has always been a Father and a Son, together
					with the Holy Spirit.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-12"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00099.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">St. Athanasius of Alexandria</span> is

					3rd-century CE priest in Rome, Sabellius, and his followers. Unlike the Arians,
					the Sabellians affirmed that the Son and the Spirit were truly God. They solved
					the problem of whether God is one or three by maintaining that Father, Son, and
					Spirit are three modes of the one God’s being. This idea is known as
					modalism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, Son, and Spirit can be thought of as masks available to an actor in a
					play. There is only one actor, but he can play three parts, simply by wearing
					three different masks. At first, this might seem like a good way to describe how
					God is experienced: sometimes Christians encounter him as the Father, at other
					times as the Son, and still other times as the Spirit.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if Christians only ever encountered God’s three masks, how
					could they be sure that they had met God himself? After all, people can wear
					masks in order to hide their true identity. What if God wore the masks to
					pretend to be something he is not? And so, instead of talking about masks or
					modes, Christian theologians began to use the Greek term <i class="calibre4">hypostases</i>, which was translated into Latin as personae, or
					persons. They posited that God is three hypostases of one <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> (Greek for essence/being&mdash;in Latin,
						<i class="calibre4">substantia</i>, or substance), so three
					persons of one substance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Such theological reasoning involved stretching the meaning of human terms in
					order to express the magnitude of God appropriately. Some of the theologians who
					achieved this most successfully were the Cappadocian Fathers: Basil of Caesarea,
					Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa (Basil’s younger brother), who
					lived in the late 4th century CE. They explained the difference between
						<i class="calibre4">ousia</i> and hypostases (substance and
					persons) by giving an example: <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> is
					humanity as a general category, while each hypostasis is an individual human.
					Every person has their humanity in common with other people; but at the same
					time, each person has individual characteristics that make them who they are.
					Defining humanity accordingly would involve stating “we experience one
					common humanity in billions of persons,” followed by listing every person
					who has ever lived, is living, and will live.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"Every act which extends from God to the creation… originates with

					divinity in common, in the same way that people share their common humanity.
					There are just three persons of the one divine substance&mdash;Father, Son, and
					Spirit.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By using the language of hypostases or persons, Christian thinkers were able
					to avoid the problems of Sabellius and modalism. It was agreed that Father, Son,
					and Spirit were not three masks worn by a mysterious divine actor, just as there
					is no ideal human lurking somewhere behind all the humans who have ever lived.
					Instead, there are three persons (Father, Son, and Spirit) who, together, are
					God.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"God is divided without division, if I may put it like that, and united in

					rather than as three separate gods? The easy answer is that if the Trinity was
					understood as three separate gods, Christians could not be certain that the God
					of the story of Jesus Christ had anything to do with the God who they believe
					created the world, or who is at work in the world today.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of a Trinity safeguards the unity of God’s relationship with
					the world. Traditionally, the Father is seen as the one who created the world,
					the Son is the one who came into the world to save it, and the Spirit is the one
					who transforms the world into the place God wants it to be. It is important that
					these are seen as one God working in three ways toward the same goal&mdash;to
					share God’s love with the world&mdash;not as three Gods pulling in three
					different directions. <a href="#calibre_link-13" class="calibre2">Augustine</a>
					explained that it is this love that binds the Trinity together.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-736"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000005.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The Trinity</span> comprises three distinct

					Trinity in order to explain how three can be one, and one three. For instance,
					St. Patrick&mdash;a 5th-century CE missionary who took Christianity to
					Ireland&mdash;used the image of a three-leaf shamrock. Others have used the
					analogy of speech to explain the Trinity: the Father is the one who speaks, the
					Son is the word that is spoken, and the Spirit is the breath by which the word
					is spoken. By far the most influential Christian theologian of the 20th century
					was Karl Barth (1886&ndash;1968), a Swiss pastor and professor. He came up with
					a helpful guide for trinitarian thinking, which has been embraced by much
					contemporary theology. The doctrine of the Trinity means that whatever is said
					about the Christian God, has to be said three times, as if telling the same
					story from three different, but complementary, perspectives. This repetition,
					maintains Barth, reflects what God’s existence is really like&mdash;whatever God does, he does as Father, Spirit, and Son.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-738"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00048.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Red rose petals fall</span> inside the

					complicated aspects of Christian theology. Nonetheless, Christians hold to the
					doctrine because they believe it reflects a vital characteristic of God. Just as
					in the debates with the Arians and Sabellians in the 4th century CE, the idea of
					the Trinity is essential to orthodox Christian faith. Groups, such as the
					Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Unitarians, who hold conflicting views on
					this issue are generally not considered authentically Christian by the
					mainstream Church.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting development in recent times has been the notion of the social
					Trinity, in which the cooperation of the three persons of the Trinity is seen as
					a model for human community. Since God can only be God as long the relationships
					between Father, Son, and Spirit are maintained, so humans, made in God’s
					image, can only be truly human as they maintain meaningful relationships with
					God and others.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"As Father, Son, and Spirit are three, they are three agents of what the

Perhaps this
					is because the debates of the 4th century CE were primarily about the
					relationship between Jesus, Son of God, and God the Father, so the Spirit
					received only a brief mention in the creeds. It might also be because the Spirit
					seems the most difficult of the three persons to comprehend, a situation made
					more confusing by the use of the older English term Holy Ghost&mdash;from the
					word <i class="calibre4">gast</i>, meaning
					“spirit.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Gospel of John, Jesus told his followers that he would send
					God’s Spirit to be with them after he had left them and ascended into
					heaven. Because the Spirit was supposed to transform the lives of God’s
					followers from the inside out, so that they would live the kind of holy lives
					that God wanted them to, the Spirit then became known as the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;While Christians of different denominations understand the Holy Spirit in
					different ways, the Pentecostal movement of the 20th century did much to raise
					the public profile of the Spirit. The movement was named after the day of
					Pentecost, when Jesus sent the Spirit to his disciples. On that day, the Spirit
					is said to have appeared as a flame above the heads of the disciples, who were
					filled with the Holy Spirit. This enabled them to preach in languages that had
					been previously unknown to them.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the Holy Spirit’s transformative power is central to
					Pentecostal Christians. They believe that believers may be taken over by the
					Holy Spirit in the way in which the Spirit took hold of the disciples. This very
					intense, personal experience is called a baptism by the Holy Spirit, and
					worshippers actively seek this spiritual renewal over and above their normal
					Christian life.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"The name of Father, Son, and Spirit means that God is the one God in

					enthusiasm for the Spirit into other denominations. The word charismatic comes
					from charismata (Greek for “gift of grace”) and refers to the
					spiritual gifts which are evidence of the Spirit’s activity among
					Christians, including gifts such as healing, prophesying, and speaking in
					tongues (or other languages).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The pronounced role of the Spirit in the Pentecostal and charismatic movements
					has prompted the Church to think through its understanding of all three persons
					of the Trinity, if it is not to inadvertently sideline one or more. The idea of
					the Trinity remains as vital now as ever, informing how Christians speak about
					the God they believe and worship.</p></div><div class="section_feature8" id="calibre_link-264"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-741"><span><img alt="" src="images/00334.jpeg" class="calibre20" /></span></div><p class="intro">Many spiritual gifts are recognized in the Christian Church. For believers,
					these gifts are given by God to the Church to help it do the work of
					God’s kingdom in the world. The gifts are for three main purposes:
					ministry, motivation, and manifestation.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians maintain that the Spirit enables some people to perform special
					roles within the Church. These ministry gifts include full-time callings to be a
					pastor or an evangelist. Motivational gifts are practical gifts that encourage
					the work of the church: these include prophecy, teaching, giving, leading, or
					showing mercy.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the Spirit’s activity is seen in a special way, such as in
					tongues (speaking with unlearned words in order to praise God), healing, or
					other miracles. These gifts are called manifestations, which show the Spirit is
					at work.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible says that the Spirit helps to produce good fruit in the lives of
					Christians: Christians grow into “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
					goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians
					5:22&ndash;23).</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="calibre2">From monolatry to monotheism</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre2">Jesus’s divine identity</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-16" class="calibre2">The unity of divinity is necessary</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					century when Pelagius, a Celtic monk, arrived in North Africa. The controversy
					was initially about the baptism of infants. Pelagius argued that there was no
					need for infants to be baptized to wash away the stain of sin, as was generally
					the belief of the time. He maintained that sin was a result of human free will,
					and since he believed infants had not developed free will, they could not have
					sinned. Moreover, if children chose to follow God’s way as they developed
					free will while growing up, there would be no need for them to be baptized at
					all.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine disagreed with nearly everything Pelagius said. He argued&mdash;based as much on experience as on logic&mdash;that it is impossible for humans
					to choose freely to follow God’s way. From birth, the weak-willed human
					veers toward choosing what is wrong, an idea that became known as original sin.
					In order to choose God, Augustine believed that humans need God’s
					help&mdash;which is precisely why baptism is so important. God chooses to give
					humans his grace (his saving help), and because God is all-powerful, whatever he
					does must be effective. Those humans who receive God’s grace are at
					liberty to make their own decision to choose God, rather than sin. Augustine
					maintained a careful balance: God’s choice does not replace human choice,
					but rather makes it possible for humans to choose.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-745"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00197.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">In infant baptism</span>, Christians believe

					decisions to inconsequential acts, because God has already decided what will
					happen&mdash;the so-called paradox of free will, by which, many argue, that
					predestination robs humans of free will. Augustine’s idea of grace is a
					valuable way of maintaining the balance between God’s choice and that of

					early monks and nuns had retreated from the world in order to live simple lives
					of devotion and prayer. They took Jesus’s words seriously&mdash;
					“What good is it to gain the whole world but lose one’s own
					soul?”&mdash;and so became ascetics, giving up worldly possessions and
					marriage to focus on their spiritual lives. The world was understood to be a
					place of many temptations, which could distract a person from the ways of God.
					As an antidote to the busyness of life, the ascetics sought quiet, contemplative
					prayer. It was said that, “Just as it is impossible to see your face in
					troubled water, so also the soul, unless it is clear of alien thoughts, is not
					able to pray to God in contemplation.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As monasticism spread out from the desert and into Europe, caves were
					superseded by specially designed buildings that became known as monasteries.
					Many were built around a cloister, an enclosed courtyard or garden used for
					meditation. Although monasteries had moved from the desert to more populated
					environments, the idea of retreating from the world in order to nurture
					spiritual life persisted.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-751"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00010.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">In the 3rd century CE</span>, one of the first

					At a time when most Christians were peasants, working long hours simply to
					survive, the monks and nuns worshipped and prayed on their behalf. Monastic
					groups such as the Benedictines (founded in the 6th century) and the Cistercians
					(12th century) offered hospitality and charity as well as prayer. Throughout the
					Middle Ages, monasteries remained centers of education. Monks and nuns copied
					and illuminated precious manuscripts, and passed on their knowledge. According
					to the monastic ideal, retreating from the world gave them the time and energy
					to serve the world in God’s name.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-129"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">EASTERN MONASTICISM</h4><div class="introimgfeature" id="calibre_link-753"><span><img alt="" src="images/00339.jpeg" class="calibre20" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">In the Eastern Christian</span> church there

				Church? Many people today would answer “yes,” pointing out that Jesus
				did not provide his disciples with instructions for setting up a religious
				institution. Some would contend that, in order to be a Christian, it is sufficient
				to have a personal belief in Jesus, without even belonging to the Church, in any of
				its denominations.</p><p class="calibre11">Despite this argument, being a member of the Church has been considered an
				essential element of Christian faith for most of its history. At first, in the years
				following Jesus’s death and resurrection, Christians simply adapted the
				religious gatherings at Jewish synagogues, from which many of the early believers
				were drawn. Like the Jews, Christians came together to pray and sing, share food,
				and read the Scriptures. For Christians, this meant the Hebrew Bible, which became
				known to them as the Old Testament, and a new collection of documents about Jesus
				and his significance, known as the New Testament.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Christian message spread into the non-Jewish world, Christian gatherings
				developed their own identity and were named <i class="calibre4">ecclesia</i>, from the Greek, meaning “called out.” This
				referred to the idea that the group had been called out by God to share the message
				of Jesus with the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-755"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-756" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Mother Church</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By the mid-3rd century CE, the theologian Cyprian had made it clear that
					belonging to the Church was a nonnegotiable element of Christian faith, not an
					optional extra. At this time many Christians were suffering intense persecution
					from the Roman authorities because of their faith; some had renounced their
					beliefs in order to save their lives. Church leaders were unsure what course
					they should take with such people. They questioned whether to readmit them to
					the Church if they truly repented, or whether to exclude them and let them form
					their own, separate communities. Cyprian was adamant that the Church should
					forgive them and allow them back, since in his understanding there could be only
					one true Church, and it was impossible for people to be saved outside it. He
					likened the Church to Noah’s Ark in the Old Testament story of the flood,
					commenting that just as the only people who were saved were those on the Ark, so
					too the only people to be saved from God’s judgment of evil were those in
					the Church.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By Cyprian’s time, the Church had already developed a clearly defined
					structure. Deacons and priests led local congregations, while bishops and
					archbishops were responsible for slightly larger geographical areas. Partly due
					to the political and economic importance of Rome itself during this early
					period, the Bishop of Rome was increasingly seen as the leader of the whole
					Church, and by the 6th century was the only bishop called the pope (from a Greek
					word meaning “father”).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Papal power increased during the medieval period. Although at first the
					Pope’s preeminence was seen as a useful way to ensure the unity of the
					Church, by the start of the 11th century, Eastern Greek-speaking church leaders
					felt they were being unfairly dominated by the Western, Latin-speaking Pope. In
					1054, in the Great Schism, the Church split into Eastern and Western branches,
					citing doctrinal differences as well as the issue of papal authority. However,
					the Pope in Rome still claimed to be leader of the worldwide Church, and at the
					Fouth Lateran Council of Church leaders in 1215, Pope Innocent III reasserted
					his authority over the powerful bishops in the Eastern Church at Constantinople,
					Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Western Europe, the Roman Catholic Church, presided over by the Pope, was
					seen as the only true family of faithful Christians until the end of the Middle
					Ages. The dominance of the Roman Catholic Church in medieval life added weight
					to the idea that it was impossible to be saved outside the Church.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-757"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00203.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The seven sacraments</span> of the Roman

					during the medieval period, its main power was spiritual. It understood that one
					of its main functions was to bring visibility to the spiritual union between God
					and his people. Because the Christian relationship with God seemed intangible by
					nature, it was more convenient to assess Christian faith by the state of a
					person’s relationship with the Church.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the Church, special rites were used to mark different stages of the
					Christian life. Known as sacraments, these rites were physical actions that had
					spiritual significance. Originally, the early Church celebrated only two
					sacraments&mdash;baptism and the Eucharist&mdash;tracing them back to the
					example and teaching of Jesus himself. However, during the Middle Ages, their
					number increased to a total of seven, all of which were offered with the
					authority of the Catholic Church. These were: baptism (the moment a person
					enters the Church and their sin is washed away); confirmation (the point at
					which a person receives the gift of God’s Holy Spirit to help live a
					Christian life); the Eucharist (a regular celebration of the forgiveness
					achieved by the death and resurrection of Jesus); penance (the actions specified
					by a priest in order for a person to be reconciled with God after confessing
					sin); extreme unction, otherwise known as the last rites (anointing and giving
					comfort and the assurance of forgiveness to the dying); and holy orders (when a
					person decides to spend their life serving God within the Church). The last of
					the seven rites was marriage, which was considered a sacrament because the close
					relationship between a husband and wife was thought to mirror the close
					relationship between God and his people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving the sacraments was a clear indication that a person remained a
					member of the Catholic Church, and so could rely on being saved by God. Church
					legislation was therefore developed to guide both priests and lay people as to
					how the sacraments should be properly used. They were considered so important
					that the clergy were forbidden from making a profit from doing their duties. At
					the Fourth Lateran Council, it was decreed that all Christians should receive
					the Eucharist at least once a year at Easter, and should also confess their sins
					and do penance at least once annually. The prayers of a priest at the bedside of
					a sick person were considered so essential that doctors were required to call a
					priest to attend to the patient before they did their own work. These important
					regulations ensured that the Church offered the sacraments freely and regularly,
					and that Church members received what was offered.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"There is one Universal Church of the faithful, outside of which there is

					made it clear that to reject the sacraments of the Catholic Church was to remove
					oneself from the Church and so also to lose the salvation offered on behalf of
					God. If the Church was to be seen as the mother of the faithful, then anyone who
					was not a child of the Church could not enjoy salvation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Special condemnation was reserved for people who not only failed to receive
					the sacraments themselves, but also taught others to reject them. Since it was
					believed that the popes of the Roman Church had inherited and passed on true
					teaching from Peter, one of Jesus’s closest disciples and considered the
					first pope, anyone who rejected the teaching of the pope was held to be
					rejecting the teaching of Jesus. Unrepentant heretics (believing in anything
					other than the teachings of the Catholic Church) faced the punishment of
					excommunication: they were removed from the Church and forbidden from receiving
					sacraments until they changed their minds. If they died before giving up their
					heresies, they could expect to miss out on God’s salvation and to endure
					the horrors of hell.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Middle Ages, the monopoly on salvation by the Catholic
					Church was challenged by the <a href="#calibre_link-49" class="calibre2">Protestant
						Reformation</a>. No longer could a single Christian institution
					claim that there was no possibility of salvation outside itself. However, the

					for hell, Gehenna, referred to a real place outside the walls of Jerusalem, the
					Valley of the Son of Hinnom. It is thought that sacrificial burnings of children
					once occurred here, and the place was considered cursed. This gave rise to the
					popular image of hell as a place of permanent fire.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Middle Ages, the horrors of hell became a regular theme in
					religious art, reminding people of their need to stay within the Catholic Church
					if they wanted to escape the threat of eternal torment.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Christian thinkers have suggested that Jesus did not mean that
					there was an actual place called hell where those who failed to accept his
					message would be punished forever. Hell was just his name for an existence
					without God. Since God is understood to be the author of life, to be without his
					presence is simply nonexistence, or everlasting death.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre2">God’s covenant with Israe</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-50" class="calibre2">Faith and the state</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-51" class="calibre2">The central professions of faith</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-29" class="calibre2">Awaiting the Day of Judgment</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				and “This is my blood.” Since then, this ritual has been celebrated by
				Christians in an act of worship known variously as the Eucharist, Holy Communion,
				the Lord’s Supper, and the Breaking of Bread. But over the centuries, the
				meaning and significance of his words have been the subject of huge controversy. In
				what sense does the bread and wine change into the body and blood of Jesus?</p><p class="calibre11">In the 13th century, the great medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas developed the
				theory of transubstantiation. He drew on the recently rediscovered philosophy of
				Aristotle to clarify previous teaching about the Eucharist. Aquinas’s
				teaching became the official doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Aquinas’s teaching was to explain how the real presence of
				Jesus could be found in the elements of bread and wine. This was important because
					<a href="#calibre_link-111" class="calibre2">Christians</a> believe that the Eucharist
				is a sacrament, a sacred act that is thought to embody a religious truth. If Jesus

					an object or person (such as Jesus) to be found in the accidents or attributes
					of other objects (such as bread and wine). He said that it was also possible for
					one object to be converted into another object: so, as the priest prayed over
					the bread and the wine, the substance of bread and wine was converted into that
					of the body and blood of Jesus (hence the term transubstantiation&mdash;
					“to change from one substance to another”). However, the accidents
					or attributes of the bread and wine remained, so the real presence of Jesus in
					bread and wine was to be believed, but not physically seen.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-765"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00036.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Holy Communion</span> is fundamental to the

					scholastic movement, which was characterized by a new method of contemplating
					the Christian faith in an academically rigorous way. Aquinas was born to a noble

					joined the recently established Order of Preachers (later known as the Dominican
					Friars). He continued his studies in Paris and Cologne, subsequently becoming a

					Christianity was his use of Greek philosophy, notably the work of Aristotle, to
					explain and defend Christian theology. Known as “Thomism,” his
					system of theology became the standard within Catholic thinking for centuries.

				Europe’s religious life, but also over its politics and economics. The Church
				was a major landowner, and, through the feudal system, many peasants found
				themselves indebted to it for their homes and livelihoods, as well as for the care
				of their souls. At the other end of the spectrum, it was in the best interests of
				nobles and rulers to maintain good relations with the Church, obeying its laws, and
				paying tithes and taxes.</p><p class="calibre11">However, in the first decades of the 16th century, a spiritual and social
				revolution shifted power away from the Catholic Church, initiating a new chapter in
				the history of Christianity in Europe. This revolution, now known as the Protestant
				Reformation, was based on the idea that God could be known and worshipped directly,
				without the need for an authorized hierarchy of priests to act as intermediaries.
				The reformers placed the teachings and traditions of the Church under the authority
				of Scripture, and maintained that salvation could only come from personal faith
				rather than from following the Church’s decrees.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-768"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00324.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-769" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Renaissance Europe</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By the 16th century, Europe had begun to shake off the old ideas of medieval
					life. The horizons of the known world were expanding rapidly, with Spanish,
					Portuguese, and French explorers following in the wake of Columbus’s
					voyage to the Americas in 1492. Transport and trade were flourishing as a result
					of advances in seafaring, including a new route around Africa to India.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, the feudal system was being abandoned in favor of new kingdoms and
					city-states controlled by rulers interested in improving the economic
					prosperity of their territories. Culturally, artists, philosophers, and
					scientists were rediscovering the classical learning of the past, in a loosely
					connected movement known as the Renaissance. In short, a new world was arriving
					and it seemed that the Church, with its ancient traditions and structures, was
					set to have a smaller role within it.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-770"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00234.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Martin Luther preaches</span> from the pulpit

					people did not understand. The authorized version of the Bible&mdash;a
					4th-century translation from the original Hebrew and Greek by St. Jerome
					known as the Vulgate, meaning “commonly used”&mdash;was also
					written in Latin. As a result, most churchgoers relied upon their priests to
					explain the truths of Christianity to them. Priests held considerable power over
					their congregations and tended to advocate the traditions of the Catholic
					Church, rather than going back to the original texts.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this meant that there was a consistency to Catholic teaching across
					Europe, there were obvious dangers as well. For instance, how could people in
					the churches be certain that their priests were teaching them what the Bible
					really contained? How could they check the truth of what they heard?</p></div><div id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Conflict with Rome</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Reformation began because a German monk, Martin Luther, believed that
					people were being deceived&mdash;sometimes unwittingly&mdash;by the priests
					and leaders of the Catholic Church of the day.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther was angered by the preaching of the Dominican Johann Tetzel, who had
					arrived in the villages near Wittenberg, Saxony, where Luther was a parish
					priest and university professor. Tetzel was essentially on a fundraising mission
					for the Church: in Rome, Pope Leo X was raising money to build a vast
					church, the Basilica of St. Peter; and, closer to home, the German Cardinal
					Albrecht needed to repay a loan taken out to defray the expenses of his
					position. Tetzel had been authorized to sell certificates, called indulgences,
					which claimed to release people from the threat of suffering for their sins in
					purgatory after their death. Indulgences had been available in the Catholic
					Church for many centuries, but Luther was appalled at Tetzel’s blatant
					sales tactics, which frightened people with terrible images of how much their
					deceased loved ones were suffering in purgatory. “As soon as the coin in
					the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs,” Tetzel warned, and
					many of Luther’s parishioners duly paid for the indulgences in the hope
					of purchasing salvation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther had become firmly convinced, from his studies of the Bible, and
					especially the Book of Romans in the New Testament, that salvation was a free
					gift from God to those who have faith, not something to be bought. He recorded
					his objections to the sale of indulgences in 95 theses, or statements, which he
					sent to his bishop, the Prince of Mainz, and reportedly pinned to the door of
					the church in Wittenberg. A copy of the theses found its way to a printer, and
					the publication became an overnight bestseller.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more was at stake than the collection of funds for a pope’s
					building project and an archbishop’s pocket: Luther’s protest
					raised the issue of authority within the Catholic Church. In 1520, Pope Leo X
					responded by publishing a document explaining how Luther had misrepresented the
					teaching of the Church, and declaring him and his followers to be heretics.
					Luther was invited to retract his views, but he refused, and even burned his
					copy of the Pope’s document.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-772"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00188.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Pope Julius II</span> is shown in this

					faith. The final authority was God’s word itself, as recorded in the
					Bible, otherwise known as the Scriptures. Luther held that it was not necessary
					for Christians to rely upon the traditions and teachings of the Church to come
					to a true knowledge of God and salvation. Instead, Christians could bypass these
					human traditions, which were often inaccurate anyway, and discover truth
					directly from the Bible. This would later be expressed by the Latin phrase sola
					Scriptura, “Scripture alone”: the Reformers were convinced that
					people do not need middle men to interpret the meaning of the Scriptures for
					them. Anyone could read the Bible and come to a clear understanding of
					God’s way of salvation, which, for Luther, did not involve indulgences,
					popes, or many of the other practices of the Catholic Church.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther’s rejection of tradition in favor of returning to original
					biblical sources fell on fertile soil in the early 16th century. The Humanist
					movement (not to be confused with modern, secular humanism) was already seeking
					to recover the classical learning that had been forgotten during the Dark Ages.
					Christian Humanists such as Desiderius Erasmus (1466&ndash;1536) encouraged
					their students to study the original languages of the Bible (Hebrew for the Old
					Testament and Greek for the New) and the writings of the very first Christians,
					the Church Fathers. The Reformation encouraged everyone to join in by reading
					the Bible for themselves.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Those who preach indulgences are in error when they say that a person is

					of the Reformation, there remained a large obstacle. Many people were
					illiterate, and even if they could read, the Bible was available only in Latin,
					and only to a select few, because every copy had to be written out by hand.
					Earlier attempts to translate the Bible into the vernacular had been resisted
					strongly by the Catholic Church. As far back as 1382, John Wycliffe had
					translated the Bible into English, but it was not available to all.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By Luther’s day, however, the printing press, which had been invented
					by Johannes Gutenberg in nearby Mainz in 1440, had revolutionized the publishing
					process. Luther harnessed this new technology: he set out to translate the Bible
					into the German language as it was spoken by ordinary people, publishing the New
					Testament in 1522 and the whole Bible in 1534. The combination of
					Luther’s colloquial language and the relative cheapness of the printed
					Bible meant that Christians across Germany could soon read the Scriptures for
					themselves. Before long, both French and English translations were printed, and
					these fueled the spread of Reformation ideas throughout Europe. Alongside
					Bibles, the printing presses of Europe churned out hundreds of pamphlets and
					books written by the Reformers, which were eagerly consumed by people thirsty
					for new ideas.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Luther has been sent into the world by the genius of discord. Every corner

					the Catholic Church, hence their name, Reformers. However, in a series of church
					meetings known as “diets” (similar to sessions of a parliament),
					it became clear that the Catholic Church would not accept the demands of the
					Reformers, which included independence from the Pope, services in the local
					language rather than Latin, and marriage for the clergy. Hopes for reform of the
					Catholic Church were finally dashed at the Diet of Speyer in 1529.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther’s followers submitted a “Letter of Protestation,”
					refusing to submit to the authority of the Church. From then on, they took on
					the new name of Protestants, which expressed their rejection of Catholic
					authority in favor of their newfound confidence in interpreting the Bible
					themselves.</p></div><div class="calibre18"></div><div class="section_feature9" id="calibre_link-261"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MARTIN LUTHER</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-776"><img alt="" src="images/00140.jpeg" class="calibre20" /></div><p class="intro">Martin Luther was born in Germany, in 1483. He gave up law school in order to
					become a monk, after nearly being hit by a lightning bolt in a thunderstorm. By
					1508 he was teaching theology at the University of Wittenberg, where he was also
					a priest. Luther’s studies led him to his key insight, which would
					develop into the doctrine of justification by faith: God declares Christians to
					be righteous in his sight simply on account of their faith in Him, and not
					because of anything good they might do (or, in the case of indulgences, might
					buy). Luther’s challenge to the pope’s authority made him a wanted
					man, but he refused to recant. He spent the rest of his life preaching and
					writing, and by the time he died in 1546, the Lutheran Church was well
					established.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1520 </b><i class="calibre4">Appeal to the German Ruling Class,</i>

					independence of their states. They began suppressing the Catholic faith and
					Church influence within their territories, adopting the motto, <i class="calibre4">Cuius regio eius et religio</i> (“Whoever is the
					ruler, his must be the religion”). In other words, they demanded the
					right to impose the Church of their choice upon their people.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Once established, the Protestant principle changed both the religious and the
					political landscape of Europe forever. It gave other rulers the grounds they
					needed to remove their kingdoms from the control of the Pope. The English
					Reformation, for example, began when King Henry VIII, a one-time opponent of the
					reformers, sought to curb the Pope’s authority in order to divorce his
					wife, Catherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestantism gave rise to a number of new branches of the Church, known as
					denominations. While the Catholic Church had been the only Church in Europe for
					centuries, a whole host of denominations emerged following the Protestant
					Reformation. While Protestants were agreed that the authority of the Roman
					Catholic Church was to be rejected, they could not agree on a unified
					alternative system of thought. Disputes between some Protestant movements were

					Church was no longer united in its thinking. To try to stem discontent over
					corruption and worldly attitudes, and reclaim lost souls from the Protestants,
					the Catholic Church launched a Counter-Reformation. In 1545, Catholic leaders
					met in the Italian city of Trent, aiming to reestablish the superiority of the
					Catholic Church against the rising tide of Protestantism. By the end of the
					Council of Trent, which spanned 18 years to 1563, traditional Catholic doctrines
					had been reaffirmed, but reforms were also introduced addressing the
					unacceptable practices of the clergy that had sparked the Reformation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;An Index of Forbidden Books was published, naming 583 heretical texts,
					including most translations of the Bible and the works of Erasmus, Luther, and
					Calvin (the Index was enforced until 1966). A church building program was
					started, with the intention of constructing great new churches with space for
					thousands of worshippers, and acoustics designed&mdash;for the first
					time&mdash;for vernacular sermons. Ignatius Loyola, a former soldier and the
					son of a Spanish nobleman, was charged with setting up the Society of Jesus, an
					order of missionaries also known as the Jesuits, who were willing to go anywhere
					without regard to their own safety, to spread Catholicism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church also used a process known as the Inquisition to reassert its
					authority, prosecuting people accused of heresy and using often brutal methods
					to extract the truth from the accused.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-781"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00096.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Churches built in northern Europe</span> for

					host to a marketplace of different churches, each vying for the hearts and minds
					of Christians. While Catholicism could claim a long and illustrious heritage,
					the idea of Protestantism seemed to match the spirit of the age. One of the
					mottos of the Reformation was <i class="calibre4">post tenebras
						lux</i>, “after darkness, light.” After the so-called
					Dark Ages, the Protestant spirit sought to shed the skin of medieval Catholicism
					and embrace a new world of ideas. It was especially confident that reading and
					hearing the Bible in a language that could be clearly understood would lead to a
					relationship with God that was uncluttered by priests, popes, and

					before returning to Geneva, where he remained until his death in 1564. Calvin

				other way around, is today accepted as fact. However, in the early 17th century,
				this theory, which had been published by the Polish astronomer Copernicus in 1543,
				was in direct opposition to the teachings of the Catholic Church and sparked a
				controversy that embroiled the finest natural scientists of the day. Most notably,
				Galileo Galilei, a mathematician in Florence, was condemned as a heretic for
				supporting the theory. The positions of the Church and of Galileo differed because
				of the different ways in which they arrived at truth. According to the Church, truth
				was revealed by God, and was supported by passages in the Bible that suggested the
				earth was at the center of the universe. Science, on the other hand, used
				experimental observations&mdash;Galileo was a pioneer of using the telescope in
				astronomy&mdash;to build theories about the workings of the world. Until well into
				the medieval period, these two methods had existed happily side by side. In the 13th
				century, for instance, the medieval theologian <a href="#calibre_link-179" class="calibre2">Thomas Aquinas</a> had
				encouraged the systematic exploration of the natural world. He took it for granted
				that a deeper understanding of creation would lead to a better knowledge of the
				creator.</p><p class="calibre11">This mutual respect was conceivable as long as the results of scientific reasoning
				coincided with the concept of “divine revelation” (truth communicated
				by God to humans through Scripture) but not when the two thought systems reached
				different conclusions. While both Catholic and Protestant denominations of the
				Church insisted that their faith in divine revelation was well placed, it seemed
				obvious to many that the results of experiment and reason were far more reliable.
				Difficult questions were soon being asked that would shake the foundations of
				Christian belief across the modern Western world, and by the end of the 18th century
				the Church was in danger of losing popular support as people increasingly doubted
				the rationality and relevance of the Christian faith. In response, Christian
				thinkers needed to articulate, in a radically new way, how religion and science,
				faith and reason, could coexist.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-792"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00145.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-793" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">From facts to feelings</h2></div><p class="calibre14">This new era of Christianity was heralded by the German theologian <a href="#calibre_link-180" class="calibre2">Friedrich Schleiermacher</a>. While working as a hospital chaplain in Berlin, he had come
					into contact with Romanticism, a cultural movement that had been born out of a
					reaction against what was perceived as the soulless rationalism of the
					Enlightenment. The Romantics emphasized the importance of feelings and emotions
					in human life at a time when ideas and objects in the world were being valued
					purely for their scientific credibilty and usefulness. Schleiermacher realized
					that as long as Christian belief was assessed according to the same criteria and
					at the same level as scientific knowledge, it would be considered unreasonable.
					Instead of trying to prove the truth of Christianity as though it were a
					scientific theory (as many of his predecessors had), he translated it into the
					realm of feelings, as championed by the Romantics. He emphasized that science
					and faith were not in competition: they should be seen as complementary because
					they both focused on different aspects of human life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-794"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00100.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Romanticism valued</span> emotion above reason

					nature of religion. In his first important book on the subject, <i class="calibre4">Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers</i>
					(1799), he discussed three realms of human life: knowledge, action, and feeling.
					Although he recognized that these three realms are necessarily related to each
					other, he was convinced that they ought not to be confused: according to him,
					knowledge belongs to science, action belongs to ethics, and feeling belongs to
					religion. Schleiermacher believed that the problem facing Christianity was that
					it had often focused too heavily on knowledge and action, and too little on
					feeling. In doing this, Christianity had opened itself up to attack by the
					rationalism of the modern world. On the one hand, scientific reason disputed
					some of Christianity’s fundamental beliefs, such as the miracles and
					resurrection of Jesus. On the other hand, the philosophy of Kant and others saw
					morality as based on universal principles, rather than on the contents of the
					Bible. The challenge to Christianity posed by science and philosophy did not,
					however, disturb Schleiermacher; on the contrary, it presented an opportunity to
					recover what he considered to be at the very heart of the Christian religion,
					which was simply, “a sense and taste for the infinite.” In his
					book <i class="calibre4">The Christian Faith</i> (1821&ndash;22),
					Schleiermacher systematically reinterpreted Christian theology as a description
					of Christian experience. For example, according to him, a statement such as
					“God exists” does not make any claim about the actual existence of
					God; instead, it describes a person’s feeling that he or she is dependent
					upon something that is beyond him or herself.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-796"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00049.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Friedrich Schleiermacher identified</span>
							true religion with a specific type of feeling. It was distinct from

					were using a form of analysis known as historical criticism to look at biblical
					texts. They studied the Bible’s original sources from the Middle East to
					reinterpret its content within a historical context. By focusing on the ways in
					which the Bible had been composed and compiled as a set of human documents, this
					analysis appeared to strip the sacred text of its supernatural origins (the
					belief that it was of divine authorship). The result was that, for many people,
					the Bible could no longer be referred to as the inspired word of God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Friedrich Schleiermacher’s view, however, helped to rescue the Bible
					from what some perceived to be irrelevance. He claimed that since religion
					relates fundamentally to experience, the Bible is supremely important as a
					record of religious experience. It can therefore be used as the ultimate guide
					to Christian experience, as believers compare their own feelings of dependence
					on God with those described within the sacred text.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach to the Bible became known as the liberal view, as opposed to the
					more conservative view, which insisted&mdash;in the face of this historical
					criticism&mdash;that the Bible contained facts about God, and not just facts
					about human experience. Tension between these two views has shaped Protestantism

					spheres of human life (religion to feeling, and science to knowledge), he was
					successful in establishing a means by which they could coexist.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while many Christians embraced Schleiermacher’s thesis as a
					solution to the friction between science and religion, others were dissatisfied
					with what they saw as the relegation of Christian faith to the sphere of
					feelings. They also identified an unintended consequence: Christianity could no
					longer claim to have an authoritative voice in the public sphere if it was
					associated most strongly with an individual’s feelings, since feelings
					are always personal. This seemed to be at odds with the original message of
					Christianity, which concerned the arrival of God’s kingdom in the whole
					world (not just in private religious experience) and indicated an important
					societal role.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set

					generation of scholars, including the eminent Swiss theologian Karl Barth. He
					was particularly appalled that his liberal theology teachers had failed to take
					a principled stand against the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s, and
					claimed that this was because Schleiermacher’s theology had been allowed
					to become far too influential within the Church. He maintained that a private
					Christian experience could be too easily indifferent to the needs of the world
					outside.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Barth argued that for Christianity to be successful in opposing some of the
					obvious misuses of science and knowledge&mdash;such as genocide, the arms race,
					and nuclear armament&mdash;in the modern world, Christian theology would need
					to be based on more than private feelings.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Christian thinkers still face the challenge of explaining to peple how
					they can trust what the Bible says about God, when what it says about the world
					is often disputed by scientific reasoning. Many Christians would answer with a
					modified form of Schleiermacher’s argument. The Bible talks about the
					same reality as that described by science, history, politics, and other social
					sciences. However, it simply answers different questions: not, “how did
					this come to be?” but “why did this come to be?” Science
					and faith&mdash;the “how?” and the “why?”&mdash;do
					not disprove each other, but complement each other. They help Christians to
					reach a more complete understanding of the universe that Galileo observed
					through his telescope.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-800"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00006.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Clergymen</span> carry a symbol of peace,

				God to humankind. To some he is a vengeful God, who not only stands in judgment at
				the end of time, but also chooses whether or not to respond to those who pray. To
				others, he is perceived as an all-knowing presence who has decided the course of
				world history and has reasons for all events, so that every detail of the future is
				mapped out in advance. In this latter representation, God is immune to appeals from
				humans for help because he has absolute prior knowledge of the outcome of every
				situation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-803"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00289.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-804" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Relevance of Prayer</h2></div><p class="calibre14">How the relationship between God and the things that happen is understood has
					deep implications for the role of Christian prayer. If God already knows the
					past, present, and future, then prayer&mdash;communicating with God by offering
					verbal praise or requests, through thoughts and meditations, or in the form of
					deliberate acts of worship&mdash;seems irrelevant. Merely telling God what he
					already knows would carry no hope of changing what will happen. However, if the
					future is not already determined by God and is truly open, then prayer becomes
					an essential part of shaping that future.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"God…is so related to the world that there is between him and that

					possessing a complete knowledge of all things past, present, and future, in the
					20th century some theologians began to reject the idea of his foreknowledge
					(knowledge of the future). If God knows what will happen, then the future must
					already be set in stone, which, they argued, would remove true freedom and
					spontaneity from history. This would also raise questions about God’s
					essential goodness, and whether he is complicit in evil if he has prior
					knowledge of it, but takes no preventative action&mdash;as may be evident, for
					example, in his knowledge, even before the creation, that humans would bring
					suffering and wickedness into the world.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-806" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The future is open</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The classic Christian view of God’s foreknowledge depends upon the
					belief that God exists outside of time, so that what is in the future for human
					beings (and hence is nonexistent and unknowable) is in the past for God (and
					therefore both exists and is knowable). However, this view owes more to ancient
					Greek philosophy than genuine Christian thinking. The Bible describes a God who
					actively accompanies his people through time, not simply watching them from a
					distant position outside of time. Moreover, Christians believe that the coming
					of Jesus as a human being should be understood as the clearest indication that
					God is not outside of time or the reality of human life on earth, since he lived
					a human life, with all its limitations. Consequently, if the future does not yet
					exist for either humans or God, then it can be truly open. Seen from this
					perspective, God is not a distant observer but an active participant in the
					historical process, a presence who listens to the prayers and appeals of people,
					responding to their needs and walking beside them in their journey through
					life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-807"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00198.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The misuse of weapons of war</span>, such as

					foreknowledge (his awareness of future events), immutability (his unchanging
					nature), and impassibility (his freedom from emotion and independence from other
					beings) was not confined to any one school of theology during the 20th century.
					The ideas have been labeled in various ways, including process theology, the
					openness of God, and open theism. In the later 20th century, a group of
					theologians emerged who have been loosely termed the “theologians of
					hope.” These include, in Germany, Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart
					Pannenberg, and in the US, Robert Jenson. One of their principal arguments was
					that because the future does not yet exist&mdash;even for God&mdash;the

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-191"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="intro">Founded in the 7th century, Islam is nevertheless regarded by its
				followers as an ancient faith&mdash;one that has always existed as God’s
				intended religion. Along with Judaism and Christianity, it is an Abrahamic religion,
				tracing its roots back to Ibrahim (Abraham), the first of a line of prophets sent to
				reveal the faith&mdash;a line that also includes Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus).
				Muslims believe the last in this line is the Prophet Muhammad, who received the
				revelations contained in the Qur’an and established Islam as it is known
				today.</p><p class="calibre11">Islam is a strongly monotheistic religion, emphasizing the oneness of an
				incomparable God, Allah (Arabic for “<i class="calibre4">the</i>
				God”), and people’s duty to serve him. Islam teaches that human life
				is a gift from God, and the way a person lives their life will be assessed on the
				Day of Judgment. The central professions of the faith are summed up in the Five
				Pillars of Islam. Religious life revolves round the mosque, which, as well as being
				a center of worship and teaching, acts as a focus for the social life of the
				community.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-809"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000055.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-810" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The last prophet</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The revelation to Muhammad is considered the final and complete revelation
					from God. Memorized by Muhammad’s immediate followers, it was written in
					the form of the Qur’an&mdash;Islam’s holy scripture and the
					ultimate and unquestionable word of God. Beyond the Qur’an, there also
					exist sayings attributed to Muhammad, collectively known as the <i class="calibre4">hadith</i>. The scriptures have inspired a rich
					tradition of scholarly interpretation. From the judgments of theologians on the
					holy books and an examination of the life of the Prophet Muhammad, has emerged a
					system of religious law and moral codes known as shari‘a, which informs
					the civil law of many Islamic countries.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From its origins, Islam has been entwined with civil and political life.
					Muhammad himself was as much a political as a religious leader and thinker.
					Because of his preaching of monotheism, he and his followers were forced to flee
					Mecca (an event known to Muslims as the Hijra, commemorated annually) for
					Medina, where he established the first Islamic city-state, with himself as
					spiritual, political, and military leader. He then led his people back to Mecca,
					conquering the city and establishing the beginnings of an empire to unite the
					disparate tribes of Arabia. Within a century of his death in 632, the Islamic
					Empire had expanded across northern Africa and into Asia. Despite disputes over
					who should succeed Muhammad, which led to the division between Sunni and
					Shi‘a Islam, the Islamic Caliphate&mdash;the Muslim political and
					religious state ruled by a caliph&mdash;wielded great political unity and
					power.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-811" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Islamic Golden Age</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Soon, the Islamic Empire extended over a wider area than Christian Europe.
					However, in contrast to Christianity, which saw scientific thought to be a
					threat to its dogma, Islam saw no incompatibility between its theology and the
					disciplines of philosophy and science. Cities such as Baghdad and Damascus
					became centers of scientific inquiry and learning. Islamic writing and poetry
					also flourished, along with decorative arts, including calligraphy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Islamic Empire eventually fragmented, but Islam remains one of the largest
					of all religions, practiced by some 25 percent of the world population. About
					three-quarters of adherents are Sunni, and 10 to 20 percent, Shi‘a.
					Around 50 countries have a Muslim majority: of these, a handful, including Saudi
					Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran are considered Islamic states, based on
					religious law; a large number of other countries, mainly in the Middle East,
					have Islam as their official state religion; others still have secular
					governments, but predominantly Islamic populations. Indonesia is the country
					with the largest number of Muslims, followed by Pakistan, India, and
					Bangladesh.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 25 percent of Muslims live in the Middle East and North Africa,
					and there are now Muslim communities in almost every other country in the
					world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Islam has come into conflict, both ideologically and politically, with the
					Christian world since the Crusades, and following colonial domination by the
					West. Recent tensions have given rise to a radical interpretation of jihad
					(struggle) by some fundamentalist Muslims as a religious duty to defend their
					faith through conflict. However, Islam is essentially a peaceable religion, and
					most Muslims identify more closely with the compassionate principles of their
					faith.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				Bahira, was living in the Syrian desert when, one day, a boy passing by with a camel
				train caught his attention. After talking with him, Bahira concluded that the sign
				of prophecy was upon the boy. He was destined for greatness, Bahira foretold, and
				should be cared for well.</p><p class="calibre11">The young boy was Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah, who became the prophet of Islam
				and, according to Muslims, God’s final messenger. This implies, of course,
				that there were messengers sent by God (in Arabic, Allah) before Muhammad; these
				include notable figures such as Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus). To Musa, God revealed
				the Tawrat, or Torah, to guide the Jews. To Isa, God gave the Injil, a lost
				scripture with a name that translates as “Gospel,” although it did not
				resemble in its form the four canonical Gospels of Christianity.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims consider Jews and Christians to be “People of the Book,”
				because, like Muslims, they are also monotheists with a holy scripture that was
				revealed to them by God. Muslims honor, in some ways, the revelations God gave to
				messengers before Muhammad, but they also believe that these revelations became
				corrupt. Jews introduced elements to the Torah that did not come directly from God.
				Likewise, Jesus’s followers mishandled his message and distorted the Gospels,
				misrepresenting God’s original intentions. Therefore, Islam teaches that the
				Jewish and Christian scriptures in their current form are no longer God’s
				pure revelations, but corrupted by human error.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-813"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00011.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre17">"Muhammad is…the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Surah 33:40</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">God’s word uncorrupted</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In order to overcome this corruption, God sent down his undefiled word one

					book. Instead, Islam is considered the original, pure, and unique revelation of
					God. It supersedes those revelations that were given to Moses and Jesus and
					mishandled by their followers. Moreover, it marks an end to further revelation.
					Muhammad is the “Seal (last) of the Prophets:” he marks a close in
					God’s revelation and is the last of God’s special
					messengers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the early 7th century, Muhammad claimed the authority of a prophet, whose
					mission was to preach the worship of the one, true God. Many Jews, Christians,
					and polytheists in his native Mecca believed his message. This fledgling
					community of Muslims was persecuted for its beliefs, and so Muhammad left Mecca
					for nearby Medina, where the Muslim community expanded.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Muhammad’s eminent status in Islam, Muslims have always looked to
					his life and words as a model for Islamic living. Many of the things he said and
					did are recorded in the Sunna, which comprises authoritative collections of
					Muhammad’s sayings (hadith) and actions (sunna). These serve as examples
					to Muslims seeking guidance on how to live their lives.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-814"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00341.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Now in Saudi Arabia</span><span class="bold1">,</span> Mecca is the holiest city of the

					trustworthy.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;When in his early 20s, Muhammad was employed by a wealthy widow, Khadija, to
					manage her business. She, too, was a camel-train merchant. Khadija later

					mid-7th century, soon after Muhammad’s death. Muslims believe that this
					compilation, and the ordering of the 114 chapters and 6,000 verses that
					resulted, were divinely inspired.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many sections of the Qur’an contain material that matches, or at least
					corresponds closely to, portions of the Hebrew Bible and Christian New
					Testament. However, according to the Muslim view, these <a href="#calibre_link-85" class="calibre2">holy books</a> are corrupted: the Qur’an is therefore believed to
					function both as a corrective to, and a progression beyond, previous
					revelations.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"Recite! In the name of your Lord who created, created man from a blood

					arranged chronologically or according to topic but, broadly speaking, by length.
					The longer chapters are found at the beginning of the Qur’an, with
					shorter chapters arranged toward the end. As a whole, the chapters cover a wide
					range of topics, providing guidance on worship, politics, marriage and family
					life, care for the disadvantaged, and even matters of hygiene, community
					affairs, and economics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to classify and date the chapters of the Qur’an, modern
					scholars have created a system for identifying them. In this method of
					classification, revelations that appear to have been given to Muhammad early in
					his prophetic career, when he resided in Mecca, are known as the Meccan
					chapters. The earliest of these Meccan revelations are often very rhythmic and
					full of imagery. Many begin with oaths. For example, chapter 95 of the
					Qur’an is introduced with, “By the fig and the olive and by Mount
					Sinai and by this city of security!”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"[It is] a Qur’an which we have divided [into
						parts], in order that you might recite it to the people at intervals.
						And we have sent it down progressively."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sura 17:106</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Later Meccan chapters are more serene and contain frequent illustrations of
					the truth of God’s message drawn from nature and history. They are more
					formal than other chapters and often discuss matters of doctrine. God is
					frequently referred to in these chapters as the Merciful.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Revelations accorded to Muhammad when he was living in the city of Medina are
					classified by scholars as the Medinan chapters. These chapters are quite
					different from the Meccan ones because, by this time, Muhammad was no longer
					leading a fledgling group of followers, but had become the head of a large,
					independent community of Muslims.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the Medinan chapters are characterized less by themes of doctrine
					and the proofs of God’s signs. Instead, more time is spent in discussion
					of legal and social matters and how such rulings should be applied in order to
					regulate life within the growing Muslim community.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in chapter 24 of the Qur’an, Muslims are told to bring
					four witnesses in order to corroborate an accusation of adultery. This was an
					important safeguard for women in a society in which even the sight of an
					unrelated man and woman together might be considered cause for suspicion. The
					testimony of those who do not provide the necessary witnesses should be rejected
					and such persons dealt with harshly according to this Medinan chapter of the
					Qur’an.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"This Qur’an is not such as could ever be produced by other than

							contain.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-822" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Rote and recitation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Western scholarship has added numbers to the chapters and verses of the
					Qur’an for ease of reference. For Muslims, however, chapters are referred
					to by specific, distinguishing words that appear within each chapter. For
					example, the Qur’an’s second and longest chapter is known as The
					Cow. This chapter is named after a story it contains about a heifer that is
					reluctantly sacrificed by the Israelites. In the account, the flesh of the
					sacrificed animal is used to bring a slain man to life again in order to
					identify his murderer.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims also rarely refer to individual verses by number, instead preferring
					to quote the beginning of a passage under discussion. This form of referencing
					of course requires not only great familiarity with the text of the Qu’ran
					but also considerable memorization skills. Nonetheless, many Muslims memorize
					large portions of the Qur’an, and some are even able to commit the entire
					book to memory.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn the entire Qur’an by heart brings great prestige and blessing,
					and a Muslim who has achieved this is known as a hafiz or a guardian of the
					Qur’an. A hafiz keeps God’s holy book alive, and is often called
						<i class="calibre4">shaykh</i>, a mark of great respect. Such
					Muslims often become reciters of the Qur’an, a role that is undertaken
					during daily prayers and other important rituals and ceremonies. This skill is
					so highly prized that auditoriums are often filled to capacity for recitation
					contests.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qur’an has a preeminent place both in Islam and within God’s
					plan for the world. It is considered the divine miracle brought by the Prophet
					Muhammad&mdash;the only miracle, in fact, as Muhammad himself did not perform
					them. Muslims believe that the Qur’an is based on a heavenly prototype, a
					book written in Arabic and existing with God in heaven. This means that, even
					though the Qur’an was given to Muhammad in the form of oral recitations
					and only later written down, the physical book itself is regarded as
					sacred.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-823"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00161.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Reading, learning, and reciting</span>

					will find many characters and stories in common. The words of the Qur’an
					appear to assume some familiarity with Jewish and Christian texts, while
					offering some gentle correctives in certain details. In the Qur’an, for
					example, Adam and Hawwa (Eve) are forgiven by God before being sent from
					paradise, because they begged for His mercy, rather than cast out and cursed as
					in the Bible. Jesus (as prophet, rather than divine figure) appears several
					times, but nowhere near as often as his mother Mary, spoken of in the
					Qur’an with a special fondness. In a miracle unreported in the Bible, the
					infant Jesus speaks up from the crib to defend his mother’s honor when
					ill-wishers accuse her of fornication.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-825" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Respect for the Qur’an</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Muslim belief that the Islamic holy scripture exists in heaven makes the
					handling of its earthly representations a matter of great care and delicacy, and
					there are several guidelines regarding how Muslims should treat their sacred
					book. The Qur’an, and the Arabic text in particular, should never be left
					on the floor or in any unclean place. When displayed among a pile of books, it
					should always be positioned on top; and when placed on a bookshelf, it should
					rest on the highest shelf, with nothing else beside or above it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, before handling the Qur’an, Muslims should make certain
					that they are ritually clean by washing themselves, just as they would before
					worshipping God. The Qur’an should also be carried with care, and for
					this reason it is frequently carried in a bag to avoid damage. If it should
					accidentally fall, then it is honored, sometimes with a kiss, and returned to
					safety. Some Muslims will make a charitable donation in cases where they have
					handled the Qur’an carelessly.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred respect shown towards the Qur’an is maintained for old and
					worn-out copies as well, which may not be thrown away, but instead should be
					disposed of through a respectful burial. This can be done in any appropriate
					place for a burial, including at sea. Some Muslims will also allow a disposal by
					fire.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipulations for the disposal of the sacred text are also meant to apply to
					any paper, jewelry, decoration, or other material on which verses of the
					Qur’an have been written. For this reason, some Muslim-majority regions
					provide special disposal bins so that such material can be collected and
					disposed of properly.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these rules of respect apply not only to the written text of the
					Qur’an, but also to its oral recitation. Since the Qur’an is
					perceived as God’s literal word, it is thought to come alive when it is
					recited. As a result, many Muslims cover their heads when it is read aloud and
					sometimes even during their personal study of the Qur’an.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"…recite the Qur’an in slow, measured rhythmic tones."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sura 73:4</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-826"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00112.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Printed and bound copies</span> of the

					Arabic makes Qur’anic Arabic not only the sacred language of Islam, but
					the language of God as well. For Muslims there is therefore a very real sense
					that the Qur’an loses its status as divine revelation when it is
					translated into other languages. Due to this belief, translations of the
					Qur’an are frequently accompanied by the Arabic text, and even then these
					texts are considered mere interpretations or translations of the meaning of the
					original Arabic. They are in no way substitutes or equivalents of the Arabic
					Qur’an.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Qur’anic Arabic is considered a divine language, other aspects of
					Muslim life and thought are further shaped around the language. For example,
					Muslims throughout the world memorize the Qur’an and their prayers in
					Arabic, regardless of whether or not they understand the language.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps most importantly, the text of the Arabic Qur’an, since it is
					holy, shares certain characteristics with God, its author. Thus, it is perfect,
					eternal, uncreated, and unchangeable. Known as <i class="calibre4">i‘jaz al-Qur’an</i> (the miraculousness or
					inimitability of the Qur’an), this doctrine means that the language,
					literary style, and ideas revealed in the Qur’an are irreproducible and
					cannot be matched by any human endeavor. Everything about it, from the
					grammatical constructions of the Qur’an’s Arabic, to the sound of
					it when it is read and chanted, and the prophecies it foretells, is considered
					miraculous and matchless. According to Muslims, any attempt to equal or surpass
					the Qur’an will surely fail.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the Qur’an’s miraculous nature is its unique
					repetition of basic themes. Opening the Qur’an at any section will often
					yield a treatment of the book’s essential message. This formulaic, and
					almost abbreviated, style is challenging for non-Muslims, or those familiar with
					the narrative structure of other holy scriptures. For Muslims, however, this
					style is a mysterious testament to the Qur’an’s unparalleled
					beauty.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qur’an is not only the most sacred book of Islam, but is also
					considered by Muslims, and even many non-Muslims, as the crowning achievement of
					Arabic literature. As such, the Qur’an is studied for its poetic prose as
					much as it is read for its divine guidance. But the respect, appreciation, and
					matchlessness accorded to the Qur’an are not limited by Muslims to its
					message or its recitation. Even the Arabic script within the holy book has
					significant visual value and plays a central role in Islamic art.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"Falsehood cannot come to it from any direction, it is preserved by God Who
						said: “Verily, We, it is We who have sent down the Qur’an and

					developed into an elevated art form: beautiful Arabic calligraphy was used to
					write out the Qur’an, often in spectacular colored inks and precious gold
					leaf.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the prohibition on portraying animals or human figures, artists
					also developed the Islamic arabesque style. This is a form of artistic
					decoration that consists of rhythmic lines, elaborate scrolling and interlacing
					foliage, and repeated geometric motifs. These artworks&mdash;which appear on
					mosaics, in the Qur’an, and inside mosques&mdash;also have an important
					spiritual message: the endlessly intertwining shapes and patterns, in which
					there appears to be no beginning or end, are intended to prompt reflection on

					of the Prophet’s close companions, formed a group of scribes responsible
					for writing down revelations as they came to Muhammad. Eventually, Zayd and his
					scholars produced a full-length manuscript of the Qur’an, which was
					cross-checked with those who had memorized the revelations to ensure that there
					were no errors. The finished manuscript was presented to Hafsah, one of
					Muhammad’s wives.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Arabic is written without vowels, a correct reading and pronunciation of
					the text depends upon the reader’s familiarity with the language. When
					discrepancies cropped up, the dialect of the Quraysh, Muhammad’s tribe,
					was given precedence. Even so, variations of the written Qur’anic text
					arose. Consequently, Uthman ibn Affan, one of Muhammad’s companions,
					oversaw the production of an authorized version in the mid-7th century. The book
					of the Qur’an as it is known today is largely a result of this
					compilation.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre2">God’s covenant with Israel</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-86" class="calibre2">The Prophet and the origins of Islam</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-51" class="calibre2">The central professions of faith</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-87" class="calibre2">The pathway to harmonious living</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				saying that the religion is based on five principles: “To testify that there
				is no god but God and Muhammad is God’s messenger; to offer the prayers
				dutifully and perfectly; to pay the obligatory alms; to perform the pilgrimage to
				Mecca; and to observe the fast during the month of Ramadan.”</p><p class="calibre11">Known as ‘ibadat (acts of worship) to Muslims, and often referred to as the
				pillars of Islam, these five practices lie at the core of the faith, and all
				branches of Islam accept and perform them.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-833"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00351.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-834" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Profession of Faith</h2></div><p class="calibre14">While not summarizing the whole of Islam as a religion, the pillars serve as a
					kind of outline of minimal obligations for Muslims to abide by. Their simplicity
					and straightforwardness are intentional, for Muslims are intended to follow God
					unencumbered by the heavy burden of religious stipulations. As the Qur’an
					confirms, “[God] has not laid upon you in religion any
					hardship.” With this in mind, the first pillar, and central creed of
					Islam, is a simple acknowledgment of the distinctiveness of the one, true God
					and the unique place of his messenger, Muhammad. This profession of faith, known
					as the shahada (witness), is the only means by which a person may become a
					Muslim. The shahada is whispered in a Muslim’s ear at birth and at death.
					It is also offered as a testimony throughout the day when Muslims are called to
					prayer. Although succinct, the shahada is made up of two significant parts. In
					the first part, Muslims bear witness to the absolute oneness of God. This
					affirms one of the core beliefs of Islam (<i class="calibre4">tawhid</i>, or God’s unity), but it also functions as a
					reminder that polytheism (belief in more than one god) and the worship of any
					being or thing alongside, or in association with, God is the ultimate sin in
					Islam.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the shahada recalls that Muhammad is not just God’s
					prophet, but his special messenger, surpassing other prophets before him. He is
					also honored as the final prophet.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-835"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00261.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">Each Muslim baby</span> has the shahada, the

					the second leader of the Muslim community after Muhammad’s death. He was
					born in the early 7th century and converted to Islam along with his father. As a
					close companion of Muhammad, Ibn Umar stood by the Prophet’s side in
					several battles and was esteemed for his nobility and selflessness.</p><p class="intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, Ibn ‘Umar is known as one of the most trustworthy
					authorities on the early history of Islam. Given his close relationship with
					Muhammad and other important figures in early Islam, he had extensive knowledge
					of the period. He also served as a credible source for many Hadith (sayings) of
					Muhammad. When he was approximately 84 years old, Ibn ‘Umar made a
					pilgrimage to Mecca and died there in 693.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-837" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Commitment to prayer</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The second pillar of Islam is salat (prayer). While Muslims may offer
					informal, personal prayers or requests to God as they wish, the main prayers of
					Islam are prescribed, quite formal and regulated, and are a designated
					opportunity to worship God.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims are summoned to prayer five times every day: at dawn, noon,
					midafternoon, dusk, and evening. In earlier times, and in some cases even today,
					a prayer leader, or muezzin, would ascend a minaret, a tall tower outside the
					mosque, and call local Muslims to prayer by chanting the shahada and urging them
					to come to the mosque. Today, muezzins often chant into a microphone, which
					projects the summons into the community via loudspeakers. Sometimes a
					prerecorded call may be played. Often, Muslims gather for prayers at a mosque,
					but when this is not possible, prayers can be performed alone or in groups in
					any location.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayers are preceded by purification, an act so important that Muhammad is
					thought to have said it was “half the faith.” For the five
					prayers, Muslims begin by washing their hands, mouth, and nostrils with water.
					They wash their entire face and clean their forearms, also passing a wet hand
					over their heads, and cleaning their feet and ankles. The number of times each
					body part is cleansed varies in different schools of Islam. Having ritually
					cleansed themselves, Muslims stand facing the direction of Mecca, the holiest
					city of Islam, and recite their prayers. In mosques, this direction is marked by
					a decorated niche known as a mihrab. Outside mosques, Muslims may find the exact
					direction of Mecca using specially marked compasses and even web-based
					applications. Those praying outside the mosque will usually perform their
					prayers on a special prayer mat, signifying that the act of prayer is performed
					in a clean place.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer is begun with the declaration, “God is most great.” Then
					Muslims recite a set of fixed prayers that include, among other passages, the
					opening chapter of the Qur’an: “In the name of God, the Most
					Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praises and thanks be to God, the Lord of the
					Universe, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the Ruler on the Day of
					Judgment. You do we worship and You we ask for help. Guide us along the Straight
					Path, the way of those on whom You have bestowed Your grace, not of those who
					earned Your anger or who are lost.” The profession of faith is then
					repeated and an offering of peace to others is offered with the words:
					“May the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.” These
					prayers are offered in Arabic and worshippers accompany them with prostrations
					and bows, together with raising and lowering their hands.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To non-Muslim observers, the Islamic prayer rituals may appear complex and
					overly regulated. For Muslims, however, participating in the habits of ritual
					purification and prescribed prayer allows them to worship God freely,
					unencumbered by the burden of their own agendas. As they join in unison with
					other Muslims to pray, they are also reminded of God’s greatness, knowing
					that fellow believers all over the world are worshipping God in the same
					way.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">The shahada</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-838" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Importance of Charity</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The third pillar of Islam is zakat (almsgiving). A central concern in the
					Qur’an is the treatment of the poor, marginalized, and disadvantaged.
					Consequently, Muslims are enjoined to care for the social and economic
					well-being of their communities, not simply through acts of charity, which are
					encouraged, but also by paying an alms tax. All adult Muslims who are able to do
					so offer a percentage, not just of their monetary income, but of their entire
					assets for this tax. This percentage is traditionally set at 2.5 percent, a
					figure arrived at by scholarly agreement, and drawn from references in the
					Sunna, for instance “one-quarter of one-tenth” of silver. In some
					cases, the offering may be up to 20 percent of farming or industrial
					assets.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"God is most great. I testify that there is no god but God. I testify that
						Muhammad is the messenger of God. Hurry to prayer. Hurry to success. God is
						most great."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Call to prayer</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Often, almsgiving is voluntary, but in some countries it has been regulated by
					governments. In such cases, stamps made specifically for sending alms are
					distributed. Otherwise, offerings can be placed in distribution boxes in mosques
					and at other locations.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the giving of alms considered an act of worship to God, but it is
					also thought to be something that is owed. If what Muslims receive comes to them
					from God’s sovereign blessing, then it is only right for them to give to
					those who have received less. With this in mind, almsgiving is not considered an
					act of charity for Muslims, but a duty they perform on behalf of those who
					require and deserve assistance. According to the Qur’an, worthy
					recipients of alms are the poor, orphans, and widows, as well as causes that aim
					to eliminate slavery, to help those who are in debt, and to spread Islam.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">"Righteous are those who…give the zakat."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sura 2:177</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-839"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00212.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The call to prayer</span> is made from the top

					Ramadan. This is the name for the ninth month in the Islamic lunar calendar. The
					penultimate night of this monthlong fast commemorates the time when Muhammad
					received the first revelation of the Qur’an from the angel Jibrail. Pious
					Muslims may pray for the entire evening, hoping that their prayers will be
					answered. In general during Ramadan, all Muslims who are physically able abstain
					from food, drink, and sexual relations during daylight hours. Instead, they use
					this time for purifying themselves by reflecting upon their spiritual condition,
					considering any wrong committed, remembering God’s great mercy, and
					contemplating the needs of their communities.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Each morning before daybreak, families gather for a small meal that must
					sustain them throughout the day. In the evening, after dark, families visit one
					another and take part in a larger meal that often includes special foods, such
					as dates, which Muhammad is believed to have eaten in order to break his
					fast.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Muslims go to their local mosque for evening prayer during Ramadan and
					recite a special prayer said only during the month of fasting. Likewise, some
					Muslims use Ramadan for acts of piety, such as reciting the entire
					Qur’an.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramadan ends with a special feast, known as ‘Id al-Fitr, which breaks
					the month of fasting. The feast is obligatory and is an enormously joyous
					occasion. Families visit one another to share in special meals and to exchange
					gifts and sweets. Businesses often close for part of the celebrations, which can
					sometimes continue for several days.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-841"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00217.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The direction of Mecca</span> from any

					Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which begins after the month of Ramadan. Every adult
					Muslim who is physically able, and has the financial means to make the trip,
					should perform the pilgrimage at least once in his or her lifetime. To do so,
					Muslims travel by whatever means possible to Mecca. Many Muslim travel agencies
					even offer special hajj packages to groups and individuals to help ensure a
					memorable and problem-free experience. As pilgrims near the city, they often
					shout, “I am here, oh Lord, I am here!” The main focus of the
					pilgrimage is the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure sitting at the center of
					Mecca’s Grand Mosque. According to tradition, the Kaaba was originally
					built by Ibrahim (Arabic for Abraham) and his son Ismail (Arabic for Ishmael) in
					order to house a black stone given to Ibrahim by the angel Jibrail (Gabriel).
					The stone was meant to symbolize God’s covenant with Ismail. In
					pre-Islamic times, the Kaaba was also a pilgrimage site for followers of
					polytheistic religions. At that time, the Kaaba was filled with shrines to
					various tribal gods. But under Muhammad’s guidance, it was cleansed of
					these shrines and restored as a symbol of worship of the one God, Allah.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Before arriving at the Kaaba, Muslim pilgrims must purify themselves. To do
					so, men wear seamless white robes and cut their hair, and some even shave their
					heads. Similarly, some women wear white robes, but many others choose to wear
					simple clothing that is traditional to their country of origin. In this state of
					purity, both men and women refrain from sexual activity, and from wearing
					jewelry or perfume. They also refrain from bathing, arguing, or anything that
					might taint their purity. In essence, everyone in their white robes represents
					not only purity, but unity and equality as well. On the one hand, the hajj is
					meant to be free of hierarchy and disunity, placing emphasis on total devotion
					to God and Muslims’ special worship during the pilgrimage. On the other
					hand, the great variety shown in female pilgrims’ clothing reflects the
					diverse character of the global Muslim community coming together in spiritual
					unison at the Grand Mosque.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-844"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00072.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The <i class="calibre21">hilal</i> or

					seven times. They will try to get as close as they can to the structure, and, if
					possible, will kiss or touch the black stone exposed in one of the
					Kaaba’s corners. During the following seven days, pilgrims pray in the
					Grand Mosque and take part in other ceremonies. For example, pilgrims drink
					water drawn from the Zamzam well inside the mosque. According to Muslim
					tradition, this well was miraculously created by God in order to sustain Ismail
					as a baby when he was stranded in the desert with his mother, Hajar (Arabic for
					Hagar). Some pilgrims run between two hills, Safa and Marwa, to commemorate
					Hajar’s search for water. They may also travel beyond Mecca, to Mina and
					Mount Arafat, where they pray to God, asking for forgiveness for the sins of the
					entire Muslim community. From here, pilgrims return to Mecca, to the Grand
					Mosque, where they circle the Kaaba again in a farewell <i class="calibre4">tawaf</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilgrimage ends with a feast commemorating Ibrahim and his obedience to
					God. Even Muslims who have not made the pilgrimage celebrate this feast, which
					lasts for three days. Much food is eaten, with the leftovers distributed to the
					poor and needy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have made the journey to Mecca honor the faithfulness shown by
					Ibrahim by symbolically stoning the devil: they throw stones at three pillars
					representing evil. Finally, many pilgrims end their pilgrimage by visiting the

					However, although they show the simplicity of Islam, any number of practical
					difficulties may be encountered in attempting to follow the necessary
					stipulations. What if the direction of prayer cannot be established? What if a
					Muslim is unable to fast on one of the days of Ramadan? God offers a simple
					solution to such obstacles: “And to God belong the east and the west, so
					wherever you turn there is the face of God. Surely God is All-Sufficient for his
					creatures’ needs, All-Knowing.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential point for Muslims is to turn toward God in worship in the best

					permissible destination for pilgrimage. Under this orthodox form of Islam, known
					as Wahhabism, veneration of historical sites, graves, and buildings associated
					with Islamic history is strongly discouraged, because it might lead to worship
					of things other than God&mdash;the sin of idolatry, or shirk. Since there is no
					concept of a sacred site or shrine, therefore, many old buildings in Mecca have
					been demolished to make way for new development, giving the city an almost
					entirely modern appearance. Not all forms of Islam follow this interpretation of
					shirk&mdash;Sufism, for example, holds the tombs of its saints and scholars in

				Muhammad was considered to have a divine right to rule, but this prerogative ended
				with him.</p><p class="calibre11">The majority of Muslims believed that the small group known as the Companions of
				the Prophet were best suited to leadership, since they were the people most closely
				guided by Muhammad and they were also the compilers of the Qur’an. One of
				Muhammad’s closest companions, Abu Bakr, was adopted as his successor. Abu
				Bakr was to be succeeded in turn by two more of the Companions, Umar and Uthman, as
				caliph, or ruler, of the Islamic territories. These caliphs were recognized as wise
				leaders and the best of Muslims. Their followers believed that choosing a leader by
				community consensus best accorded with the ideas in the Sunna, Muhammad’s
				teachings and sayings. These early caliphs were therefore appointed or elected, and
				the supporters of Abu Bakr and his two successors became known as Sunni
				Muslims.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-850"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00358.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-851" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">An Alternative Choice</h2></div><p class="calibre14">A minority group of believers disagreed with Abu Bakr’s original

					relative of Muhammad, and, in particular, a member of a special group known in
					the Qur’an as the Household (family) of the Prophet. This group claimed
					that Muhammad had suggested a successor: his son-in-law and cousin ‘Ali
					ibn Abi Talib, because Muhammad had publicly honored ‘Ali’s
					ability to lead the community. Shi‘a Muslims take their name from
					‘Ali, whom they see as the Prophet’s rightful heir&mdash;they are

					656, after the death of Uthman, but when ‘Ali died, Muslims were again
					divided; Shi‘as supported ‘Ali’s son as successor, while
					Sunnis supported the election of Muawiyah I, a powerful governor of Syria. To
					this day, Shi‘as remain a minority group within the Muslim community,
					dedicated to ‘Ali and his successors. These descendants of Muhammad,

					(<i class="calibre4">islam</i> means submission) is the mark of a
				true Muslim. To help followers navigate life in ways that are pleasing to him, God
				has offered a pathway known as shari‘a, meaning literally “the road to
				the watering hole.” In the context of Arabia’s deserts, a road to
				water is a great treasure and, similarly, shari‘a is the pathway, by
				God’s law, to harmonious living. It is a system of ethics and a science of
				law (<i class="calibre4">fiqh</i>) that is meant to govern humankind and
				guide everything people do.</p><p class="calibre11">This system required sources to refer to, and, early on, Muslims relied on
				Muhammad’s revelations (the Qur’an) and his example (Sunna) for
				direction. With his death, however, this guidance ceased. As it was, the question of
				how to apply existing revelations to everyday life, across the various cultures of
				the growing Muslim community, was a delicate matter. Despite the emergence of
				Islamic judges who could rule on public and private concerns, there was a call for
				more uniform and clearly defined shari‘a.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-854"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00219.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Defining Islamic Law</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Scholars keen to standardize Islamic jurisprudence emerged in many Muslim
					communities, leading to disagreement over how to apply the law. Should its scope
					be restricted to the teachings of the Qur’an and the Sunna, or could
					jurists incorporate their own analysis and reason? By the 8th century, Muslims
					differed widely on the application of shari‘a. Scholar Abu
					‘Abdallah Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi‘i, seen by many as the
					father of Islamic jurisprudence, came to the fore to offer unifying thought on
					the legal concerns of the day. According to al-Shafi‘i, there were four
					sources of law: the Qur’an, the Sunna, the consensus of the community
						(<i class="calibre4">ijma</i>), and analogical reasoning
						(<i class="calibre4">qiyas</i>).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Believed to be the literal word of God, the Qur’an is the primary
					source for Islamic principles and values. In many passages, it directly
					addresses matters such as murder, exploitation of the poor, usury, theft, and
					adultery, clearly condemning them. In other instances, the Qur’an works
					to curb certain behavior over time. For example, early revelations on alcohol
					suggest that while some good may be found in it, it may also have a connection
					to sin (2:219). Later revelations prohibit Muslims from praying while drinking
					(4:43), and the latest plainly condemn the use of alcohol (5:93). The
					Qur’an also guides Muslims in personal and community affairs. For
					instance, while it does not expressly prohibit slavery, it does offer guidance
					on how to treat slaves. Marriage concerns such as polygamy, dowry, and
					inheritance rights for women are also governed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipulations such as these are explicit in the Qur’an and offer clear
					guidance. However, while the Qur’an treats other matters of morality and
					civic duty in a similar fashion, much of its treatment of legal concerns tends
					to be generic. In these cases, the example of Muhammad given in the Sunna
					supplements the Qur’anic material. While the Sunna cannot replace the
					Qur’an’s authority, the belief that Muhammad was inspired by God
					led to the acceptance of his example as authoritative. Al-Shafi‘i refined
					the use of the Sunna in legal matters by restricting the use of the term Sunna
					to Muhammad. Doing so eliminated any confusion with local customs, and added
					greater authority to the traditions of the Prophet. However, collections of
					Muhmmad’s sayings, actions, and what he prohibited and allowed grew in
					number, requiring the application of a strict process of validation. As a result
					of this, legitimate traditions of Muhammad&mdash;that is, those with a proper
					chain of authority and not contradicting the Qur’an&mdash;can be brought
					to bear on legal matters.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-855"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00124.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">“The road to the watering
								hole”</span>&mdash; the literal translation of
							sharia&mdash;is a concept that has considerable resonance for believers
							who came from an unforgiving desert climate.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-856" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Legal Interpretation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Even with al-Shafi‘i’s definitions, situations could arise that
					are not specifically addressed in either the Qur’an or Sunna. With
					Muhammad no longer alive to offer guidance on such legal matters, the role of
					interpretation became crucial. Al-Shafi‘i therefore sought to give
					authority to legal interpretations reached by consensus among the Muslim
					community. Early on, this was a practical way for solving problems on which the
					Qur’an and the Sunna were silent; majority opinion would help in reaching
					decisions. Over time, however, “the community” came to be defined
					in legal terms as a collective body of legal scholars and religious authorities
					whose decisions would be made on behalf of wider Muslim society. There remained
					some situations where no authoritative text existed, and when consensus could
					not be reached. Initially, jurists used their own judgment to arbitrate new
					legal concerns. This was known as <i class="calibre4">ijtihad</i>, or
					striving intellectually, and incorporated a judge’s personal opinion or
					reasoning. Al-Shafi‘i restricted the role of personal reasoning in
						<i class="calibre4">ijtihad</i> to the use of deductive reasoning
					to find analogous situations in the Qur’an or Sunna from which new legal
					rulings could be derived. For example, the Qur’an prohibits making a sale
					or a purchase during the call to Friday prayers: Muslims are instead urged to
					cease trading so that they may gather for worship (62:9&ndash;10). What about
					other contracts that might be made during the call to prayer? Should a marriage,
					for example, be arranged during this time? The Qur’an is silent on the
					matter, but analogical reasoning can be used to derive a legal opinion. If the
					aim of the Qur’an is to discourage actions preventing Muslims from
					worship, then, likewise, restriction on business can be applied to other
					contracts, actions, or services such as a marriage. Instead of scholars merely
					offering a personal opinion on matters such as these, al-Shafi‘i helped
					to ground creative thinking in the authoritative sources of Islam, the
					Qur’an and the Sunna.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre17">"There has come to you from God a light and a clear book by which God

					law&mdash;the Qur’an, the Sunna, community consensus, and analogical
					reasoning&mdash;did much to unify shari‘a, different schools of law use
					these sources in different ways. From the 13th century, four schools have
					predominated in Sunni Islam, the largest branch of the faith. Each school is
					named for the individual who framed its main concerns: Shafi‘i, Hanbali,
					Hanafi, and Maliki. The Shafi‘i and Hanbali schools rely on evidence from
					the sources in interpreting law, while the Hanafi and Maliki encourage analagous
					reasoning as well. Further schools of law developed in Shi‘a Islam. Given
					the key role of the imam for Shi‘a Muslims, these schools emphasize the
					traditions of ‘Ali and the imams. Muhammad’s cousin ‘Ali,
					is seen by Shi‘as as the first imam&mdash;a point on which Sunnis and
					Shi‘as disagree. Shi‘as often favor the rulings of the imam, their
					supreme leader and highest authority on law, over analogical reasoning and
					community consensus.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The schools of law remain in Muslim society today. In regions where Muslims
					are predominant, scholars rule on legal matters in courts of law and issue
					fatwas (rulings). In turn, judges enforce and uphold the law. Muslims facing
					more mundane questions as to the best way to live a Muslim life may also ask for
					authoritative advice. In non-Muslim societies, local scholars offer guidance to
					their communities and, in a modern twist, Muslims can also consult web-based

				expectation of being able to understand his nature or his actions. This was the
				conclusion reached by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash’ari in the 10th century, when Islam
				entered a controversy stirred up by philosophical speculation about the nature of
				God.</p><p class="calibre11">In the 8th century, caliphs (civil and religious heads of the Muslim state) of the
				Abbasid dynasty had encouraged the development of scholarship and the arts in the
				Islamic world, and Arabic translations of works by Greek philosophers, such as
				Aristotle, became available to Muslim theologians. Some of these scholars applied
				the new Greek ways of thinking to the content of the Qur’an. They formed a
				group called the Mu‘tazilites, which became a prominent force in Islamic
				theology in the 9th century.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-862"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00314.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre17">"God…is unlike whatever occurs to the mind or is pictured in the

					methods could be used to resolve apparent contradictions in the Qur’an.
					The Qur’an stresses the unity of God&mdash;he is indivisible, and so
					cannot have any kind of body, made up of parts, as humans have. Yet there are
					passages in the Qur’an that specifically refer, for example, to
					God’s hands and eyes. To take descriptions such as these literally would
					lead to anthropomorphism (attributing human characteristics to God) and might be
					seen as comparing God with the beings he created, which was the greatest sin.
					The Mu‘tazilites proposed that such references are metaphorical. So, for
					example, a reference to God’s hand could be interpreted as indicating his
					power. They then applied Greek logic to other theological issues, such as free
					will, predestination, and determining the nature of the Qur’an
					itself&mdash;whether it had existed eternally, or had been created by God at
					some point.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Before long, however, the wide-ranging speculation of the Mu‘tazilites
					began to attract censure and turn public opinion against them. Theological and
					philosophical speculation about God is permissible and indeed important to
					Islamic thought, but seeking answers to questions not specifically addressed by
					the Qur’an or Muhammad is, according to Islam, not only unnecessary, but
					also a sin&mdash;<i class="calibre4">bid‘ah</i>, the sin of
					innovation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One Mu‘tazilite thinker, al-Ash‘ari, refused to reduce the
					Qur’an’s descriptions of God to metaphors, but he also refused to
					anthropomorphize God. Instead, he asserted that God might be described as having
					hands without Muslims knowing how this might be possible. Al-Ash‘ari and
					his group of fellow-thinkers, known as the Ash‘arites, left the words of
					the Qur’an intact, but also kept theological thinking about God pure, by
					refraining from speaking about him in human terms, since God is beyond

				struggle against evil. This striving or struggling is known as jihad.</p><p class="calibre11">For most Muslims, jihad is used in two different ways. The “greater
				jihad” is the most common. This is the constant struggle against personal
				sin, involving repentance and seeking God’s mercy, avoiding temptation, and
				pursuing justice for others. The “lesser jihad,” although less common
				for Muslims, is the more widely known. It involves the legitimate use of force,
				sometimes militarily, against those who do evil.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 11th century, one of Islam’s most noted legal scholars, Shams
				al-A’imma al-Sarakhsi, discussed lesser jihad as a four-stage process. He
				argued that in the first stage, jihad toward others should be peaceful and passive.
				In the second stage, Islam should be defended with peaceful argument. The third
				stage allowed for followers to defend the Muslim community against injustice. In the

					Humans themselves are creations of extraordinary complexity. And if everything

				the true worship of God, then Sufi mysticism is an interior path helping its
				practitioners not only to follow God, but to be closer to him. In the early stages
				of Islam’s development, simple obedience to the will of God was not a strict
				enough doctrine for some Muslims. In response to the growing indulgence of the
				ruling Muslim elite as they gained in power, disenchanted Muslims wished to return
				to what they felt was the purity and simplicity of Islam during the time of Prophet
				Muhammad. They pursued an ascetic lifestyle by removing themselves from the material
				world and seeking a direct, personal experience of God. Some Sufi Muslims even
				declared that God was within them.</p><p class="calibre11">As Sufism developed, groups, or orders, were founded, in which religious masters
				taught the doctrine to students. At the heart of many of these orders lay the belief
				that the self must be renounced in order to fully abide in God. Accordingly, Jalal
				al-Din Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi master, wrote of an impoverished Arab and his
				greedy wife who live in the desert. The woman urges her husband to offer their
				filled water pot to God, hoping they might receive something in return. Although
				reluctant, the husband succumbs to his wife’s urgings and offers the
				pot&mdash;and, in return, it is filled with gold. This treasure is, however, of
				little use to them in the desert and therefore acts as a reminder that the pursuit
				of wealth and self-interest detracts from the correct focus on God. In the same
				parable, Rumi recounts the heavenly angels’ jealousy of Adam. They, too,
				forsake their focus on God. The parable, for Rumi, describes humanity in general and
				the temptation to pursue the self. For Sufis, an individual’s focus should be
				the denial of the self in the pursuit of an experience of God.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-879"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00321.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-880" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Renouncing the worldy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In Sufism, achieving a personal experience of God involves moving through
					successive stages of renunciation, purification, and insight. As a result, not
					only are Sufis ascetic&mdash;breaking ties to the material world through
					poverty, fasting, silence, or celibacy&mdash;but they also place great emphasis
					on devotional love of God, often through religious experiences or psychological
					states. This is often achieved through the repetition of God’s names (for
					example, God the merciful, God the great) or meditative breathing exercises.
					Becoming absorbed in these exercises helps the Sufi practitioner to forget

				or divinely appointed reformer, of Islam. He had come, so he claimed, to rejuvenate
				Islam and to return it to its pure foundations. The movement that formed around him
				came to be called Ahmadiyya.</p><p class="calibre11">In orthodox Muslim thinking, the Prophet Muhammad is the final prophet of Islam,
				and anyone else claiming the status of prophet should therefore be denounced. But
				Ghulam Ahmad did not claim to bring a new revelation beyond the Qur’an.
				Rather, he simply offered a new interpretation, with the aim of bringing the Muslim
				community back to its roots. As such he was comparable with other, minor prophets
				who did not bring the law, but restored it: Aaron, for example, who is thought by
				Muslims to have been sent by God to revitalize the message given to Musa
				(Moses).</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghulam Ahmad had previously developed some unorthodox teachings. Part of his
				message was that Isa (Jesus) did not die on the cross, nor was he&mdash;as Muslims
				traditionally believed&mdash;saved from death on the cross by being raised up to
				heaven by God. Ghulam Ahmad claimed that Jesus merely swooned, subsequently
				recovered, and went to Afghanistan and Kashmir in search of the lost tribes of
				Israel. Ghulam Ahmad also challenged Islamic thinking concerning jihad, claiming
				that the only acceptable form was a spiritual jihad designed to peacefully spread
				the message of Islam. This was a particularly significant idea in the context of
				19th-century India, where anti-British unrest was growing.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-885"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00209.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Controversial claims</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Ahmad’s claims evolved as his followers grew in number, and he declared
					himself not just to be Islam’s prophetic reformer, but its
					redeemer&mdash;a messianic figure known to Muslims as the Mahdi&mdash;and the
					spiritual successor of Jesus. For many Muslims, these claims went too far and
					challenged the place of Muhammad and the revelation given to him. For these
					reasons, Ghulam Ahmad and his followers were rejected by many Muslims.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even within his own movement, Ghulam Ahmad’s assertions caused
					controversy. After his death in 1908, the Ahmadiyyas split into two factions:
					Qadiani Ahmadiyyas, who maintained Ghulam Ahmad’s teachings, and a new
					branch known as Lahori Ahmadiyya. The Lahori branch accepted Ghulam Ahmad as a
					renewer of the Islam faith, but this was as far as they were willing to go.
					They, too, rejected his claim that he was a minor prophet.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pakistan in 1973, Qadiani Ahmadiyyas were legally declared non-Muslims,
					and, in 1984, an ordinance was drafted allowing for punishment of any Qadiani
					who claimed to be a Muslim, used Islamic terminology, or referred to his or her
					faith as Islam. The Qadiani Ahmadiyyas have since moved their international

				powers were in decline. The Ottoman and Mughal empires had lost political influence,
				and Western powers were colonizing the predominantly Muslim areas of northern Africa
				and parts of Asia&mdash;French North Africa, British India and the Middle East, and
				Dutch Indonesia. Some Muslims welcomed the changes and modernizations that came with
				the Western presence. For others, however, the influence of the West forced them to
				consider the place that science and technology, Western politics and economics, and
				even fashion had in their lives. Some wished simply to protect Islam against the
				secularization that came with modernization; others were more militant and
				anti-Western, seeking to overthrow imperialist governments; others still were
				prepared to accept a degree of Western influence, but sought clear dictinctions
				between what was Islamic and un-Islamic.</p><p class="calibre11">Out of this context emerged a number of very influential Islamic thinkers and
				reformers. Although each had their own contexts and emphases, they were all aware of
				the weakness of the global Islamic community at the time, and felt that Muslims
				straying from Islam under Western influence were responsible. As a result, they
				sought to revive the role of Islam as the dominant influence in their
				societies.</p><p class="calibre11">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Muslim revivalists felt that the best way forward was to restore Islam by not
				only shedding the influence of the West, but by emphasizing the superiority of Islam
				as well. To do this, they argued for the central role of <a href="#calibre_link-131" class="calibre2">jihad</a> in
				religious and political life. Taken in this sense, jihad became a revolutionary
				struggle against un-Islamic forces, eliminating perceived evil in pursuit of what
				revivalists believed was justice and righteousness. Likewise, the revivalists
				thought that immoral governments should be replaced by Islamic systems established
				according to divine principles. In many Muslim revivalists’ minds, a
				government based upon the Qur’an and Islam would provide the perfect social
				system, and the best way to achieve it was by a jihad that expressed itself through
				militant action, resistance, and revolution.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-890"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Egyptian activism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Sayyid Qutb, a Muslim activist in 20th-century Egypt, became one of the most

					increasingly weak and corrupt under British colonial rule. Having become
					disillusioned by his experience of the West and its cultural influence, Qutb
					sought to lead fellow Muslims out from under foreign control and back to Islam.
					He wrote extensively on the Qur’an and its interpretation, as well as
					matters of religion and the state, and joined the Muslim Brotherhood, a group
					formed in Egypt in the 1920s, which aimed to use the Islamic faith as a means of
					“ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community…and

					Muslims had an obligation to establish their moral standards on earth so that
					everyone could benefit from them. Jihad, then, became a continual struggle
					against unbelief and injustice, or what Qutb called <i class="calibre4">jahiliyya</i>. This term was traditionally used to describe the age
					of ignorance&mdash;the period before the revelation of the
					Qur’an&mdash;but it was applied by Qutb to everything he considered
					alien to Islam. For him, <i class="calibre4">jahiliyya</i> was not
					just a period of time, but a state of being that was repeated every time a
					society strayed from the path of Islam.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre17">"I went to the West and saw Islam, but no Muslims; I got back to the East

					others,” considering this to be a violation of God’s sovereignty.
					This included communist nations (because of their state-imposed atheism) as well
					as polytheist nations such as India, and Christian and Jewish states. Qutb also
					argued that many Muslim countries lived in a state of <i class="calibre4">jahiliyya</i> because they accepted alien&mdash;and in particular
					Western&mdash;ideas and tried to incorporate them into their governments, laws,
					and cultures. For Qutb, the only effective way to rid society of <i class="calibre4">jahiliyya</i> was by implementing an Islamic way of

					long as foreign, un-Islamic forces exerted their influence. This meant that
					Muslim scholars who interpreted the Qur’an in such ways as to suggest
					that its discussions of jihad were no longer applicable in the modern world were
					misled. Qutb argued that jihad was meant to be enforced in his day in the same
					way it was when the Qur’an was revealed; this might not mean eliminating
					every non-Muslim from power, but it did mean shedding the influence the West had
					upon the world. Muslims should do what was necessary to ensure that a pure Islam
					as a system of governance could flourish uninhibited by un-Islamic pressures. In
					this way, Qutb helped to shape not only how future Islamic revivalists would see
					the world but how the people in the West would come to perceive Islam in the

				wherever they are, to promoting good and equity within and through human

				interpret them in the context of their own cultural background, taking
				responsibility for their faith in the environment they inhabit. Ramadan’s

				civilizations, with their foundations in the folk traditions that preceded them. The
				Abrahamic religions (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity), for example, trace
				themselves back to the stories of Noah and the Flood, long before any Middle Eastern
				civilizations, and, similarly, the various branches of Hinduism are based on beliefs
				that predate Indian civilization.</p><p class="calibre11">As philosophical and scientific thinking became increasingly sophisticated over
				the millennia, these faiths faced a choice: to adapt with the times and embrace
				change, or denounce anything new as heretical. Breakaway sects emerged,
				and&mdash;driven by events such as the Industrial Revolution in Europe, and the
				exploration and colonization of new lands&mdash;gave rise to a number of new
				religious movements fueled by reluctance to compromise in the face of change.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-900"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00074.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-901" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New faiths</h2></div><p class="calibre14">It is often difficult to determine whether a breakaway group is a branch of an
					older religion, or a completely new faith. Mormons and Jehovah’s
					Witnesses, for example, both believe in the divinity of Jesus, but many of their
					other beliefs separate them from mainstream Christianity. Similarly, Tenrikyo
					and other new Japanese religious movements bear many similarities to both
					Buddhism and Shinto, and both the Hare Krishna and Transcendental Meditation
					movements are obviously derived from Hinduism. Their status as new religions
					depends greatly on how much they are accepted or rejected by the parent
					religions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, syncretic religions&mdash;amalgams of two very different
					faiths&mdash;have evolved, especially among displaced or oppressed people. For
					example, while Africans taken to the Caribbean as slaves were forced to adopt
					their masters’ Christianity, they used it as a framework for practicing
					the religions of their homelands, resulting in creole faiths, such as Santeria
					(also known as Regla de Ocha or Lukumí), Candomblé, Orisha-Shango,
					and Vodun (or Voodoo), depending on the tribe they had come from. In the 20th
					century, a Jamaican religion, the Rastafari movement, grew out of the Black
					Consciousness movement, building a mythology around the Emperor Haile Selassie

					in the Pacific region also led to new varieties of traditional folk religions,
					known as the cargo cults.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other new religions have emerged as specific to a particular location.
					Sikhism, for example, is associated with the Punjab region of Pakistan and
					India; the religion was founded as a reaction to the hostility between Hindus
					and Muslims in the area, and was based on a peaceful, democratic social
					foundation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in its Book of
					Mormon provided a specifically US addition to the Christian Bible, with a
					mythology of saints and angels among the indigenous American people. Other
					modern religions have been established with the aim of uniting all faiths, or at
					least recognizing the validity of other beliefs and embracing them in their own
					faith: these, which include Baha’i, Cao Đài, and Unitarian
					Universalism, have arisen in various areas of the world where a variety of major
					faiths have historically coexisted.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-902" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Search for the spiritual</h2></div><p class="calibre14">A quest for mystical enlightenment produced the Hasidic movement in Judaism,
					and Sufism in Islam, and some Christian denominations have become more
					charismatic in recent years. Others in the West have drifted away from religious
					tradition: some to the past and neopagan religions such as Wicca; others to
					movements from the East such as ISKCON, Transcendental Meditation, and Falun
					Gong; while others, notably Scientology and some modern Japanese religions, have
					grown out of loosely science-based beliefs. Many of these new religions were
					founded by a charismatic leader or prophet who claimed divine revelation, and
					have been dismissed as cults designed for the glorification of their leaders.
					Some such faiths have declined in popularity, but others have gained a strong
					following and an eventual acceptance as new religious movements in their own
					right. Before dismissing them, it is as well to remember that Christianity was
					initially considered a cult by the Romans and Jews, and that Muhammad was driven
					out of Mecca with his small group of followers for his heretical beliefs.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				who became disillusioned with the Hinduism that had surrounded him when he was
				growing up in a village near Lahore (in modern Pakistan) in the 15th century. Islam
				had also influenced this area since the 10th century, and its importance grew as the
				Mughal empire in India expanded.</p><p class="calibre11">Guru Nanak viewed the Hindu emphasis on ritual, pilgrimage, and reverence for
				prophets and holy men as a hindrance to what he considered most important&mdash;our
				relationship with God. Although he used many different names for God, he recognized
				him as one omnipresent, transcendent divinity, similar to the concept of Brahman in
				Hinduism. Following a revelation from God when he was around 30 years old, Nanak
				devoted his life to preaching the path to salvation. He argued that the way in which
				believers conduct their lives is an integral part of achieving unity with God and
				finding salvation. After accepting the title of guru, or teacher, from his
				followers, he went on to become the first of a succession of 10 Sikh gurus, whose
				teachings are collected in the Sikh holy book, the Adi Granth. This book came to be
				considered as the 11th and final guru of Sikhism, and is known as the <a href="#calibre_link-231" class="calibre2">Guru Granth Sahib</a>.
				Nanak’s followers became known as Sikhs, from the Sanskrit word for learner
				or disciple, guided in their way of life by God and the gurus.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-904"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000024.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-905" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Finding God in a good life</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Like Hindus, Sikhs believe in the cycle of death and rebirth. However, they
					take a different view of the purpose of human life. For the Sikh, the aim is not
					to attain a place in paradise, since there is no final destination of heaven or
					hell. Instead, Sikhism teaches that being born human is a God-given opportunity
					to take the path to salvation, which follows five stages, from sinning to
					achieving freedom from the cycle of death and rebirth. The five stages are:
					wrongdoing; devotion to God; spiritual union with God; attainment of eternal
					bliss; and freedom from rebirth.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the most of this opportunity, Sikhs follow a strict code of conduct
					and conventions, which was formally laid down by the 10th guru, Guru Gobind
					Singh, when he created the order of the Khalsa, the community of all Sikhs
					baptized into the faith, in 1699.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-906"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00343.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The Khalsa order was founded</span> in

					means “the pure” or “the free”). Members are
					encouraged not only to share with others, but also to protect the poor, the
					weak, and the oppressed. This was a crucial part of Guru Nanak’s original
					philosophy, and it was reinforced during the period of the Ten Gurus, when Sikhs
					were persecuted both by their Muslim rulers and by Hindus, who regarded the Sikh
					faith as heretical. Guru Gobind Singh’s intention in forming the Khalsa
					was to establish an order of Sikhs that embodied the twofold virtues of bhakti
					(spirituality, or devotion) and shakti (powerfulness). He envisioned an ideal of
					the <i class="calibre4">sant-sipahi</i>, or saint-soldier, who first
					and foremost led the life of a saint in his devotion to God, but would act as a
					warrior to defend his faith or prevent injustice, if necessary.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Khalsa would protect the weak, and dedicate themselves to a virtuous
					lifestyle of chastity and temperance, ridding themselves of the five
					vices&mdash;lust (<i class="calibre4">kaam</i>), anger (<i class="calibre4">krodh</i>), greed (<i class="calibre4">lobh</i>), emotional attachment (<i class="calibre4">moh</i>), and egotism (<i class="calibre4">ahankar</i>)&mdash;and keeping God in mind at all times. Guru Gobind
					Singh codified a lifestyle that was appropriate to all Sikhs when he established
					the Khalsa order: not only did he prohibit rituals, pilgrimages, and
					superstitious practices, but he also outlined the virtues necessary to a life
					devoted to God, such as honesty, simplicity, monogamy, and avoidance of alcohol
					and drugs.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Khalsa were not asked to renounce the world in their devotion to God, in
					fact quite the opposite: they were asked to play an active part in it by
					commitment to family and community, and by demonstrating a social conscience,
					which is considered one of the highest of all the Sikh virtues.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Guru Gobind Singh stressed that a Sikh should act like a warrior only out of
					necessity in leading a saintly life: he should be a soldierlike saint rather
					than a saintlike soldier, and all Sikhs should act on the principle of
					“fear not, frighten not.” Singh likened the courage needed to
					behave in this way to that of the lion, and suggested that Sikhs being baptized
					in the Khalsa order should adopt the surname Singh (“lion”) or
					Kaur (“lioness”).</p></div><div id="calibre_link-908" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Five articles of faith</h2></div><p class="calibre14">After they are baptized in the Khalsa order, Sikhs are expected to wear the
					five articles of faith, commonly known as the “five Ks,” as an
					outward expression of their status as saint-soldiers. Each of
						these&mdash;<i class="calibre4">kesh</i> (uncut hair), <i class="calibre4">kangha</i> (comb), <i class="calibre4">kara</i> (bracelet), <i class="calibre4">k</i><i class="calibre4">achera</i> (undergarment), and <i class="calibre4">kirpan</i> (sword)&mdash;has a deep symbolic meaning, as well as
					distinctively identifying the wearer as a Sikh.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair is considered by Sikhs to be a gift from God, and <i class="calibre4">kesh</i> (the practice of leaving the hair and beard uncut) is seen,
					in part, as the avoidance of vanity. However, it is also a symbolic
					representation of the ideal of leading a life in a way that God intended,
					without interference, and in harmony with his will, and as such is an important
					outward sign of the Khalsa code of conduct.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sikhs are expected to keep their hair clean and well-groomed, combing it twice
					daily with the <i class="calibre4">kanga</i>, a special comb that is
					also used to hold it in place under a turban. This regular grooming is a
					constant reminder of the Sikh’s duty to lead a virtuous life devoted to
					God, which is why the <i class="calibre4">kanga</i> is also
					considered one of the five articles of faith.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The most easily identifiable aspect of a male Sikh, his turban, is not
					actually one of the five articles of faith. Nevertheless, it has become an
					essential item of Sikh clothing and has helped to give its wearers a strong
					sense of identity and social cohesion. The turban was adopted at the suggestion
					of Guru Gobind Singh, who pointed out that all the gurus had worn a turban, and
					that doing likewise would help the wearer to concentrate on following their
					example. The primary purpose of the turban, however, is to pull back and protect
					the uncut hair of male Sikhs.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-909" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Proofs against temptation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Just as important as the positive virtues is the avoidance of vice. The steel
					bracelet known as the <i class="calibre4">kara</i> is a symbol of the
					vows taken by a Sikh during baptism to refrain from the five vices. Because it
					is worn on the wrist it is often visible to the wearer, and therefore acts as a
					frequent reminder to consider carefully whether his or her actions will lead to
					evil or wrongdoing. The <a href="#calibre_link-232" class="calibre2">Jain faith</a>
					uses a very similar device, in the form of its emblem of the raised palm: a
					reminder to stop and consider the intention behind any action. Similarly, the
						<i class="calibre4">kachera</i>, a cotton
					undergarment&mdash;worn by both men and women&mdash;that resembles
					loose-fitting shorts, ostensibly acts as a warning to control sexual passion and
					desire, but is also a symbolic reminder that Sikhs should strive to overcome
					desires of all kinds and lead a faithful life in a broader sense.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-910"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00269.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The Sikh turban</span> is an important symbol

					movements in the Punjab, where it originated. The region has often suffered from
					religious conflicts, which Sikhs have inevitably been drawn into. There was even
					a short-lived Sikh Empire formed in 1799 but dissolved by the British in 1849.
					After the formation of the Akali, a Sikh reform movement, in the 1920s, and the
					Akali Dal political party in 1966, there were calls for an autonomous Sikh state
					in the Punjab, where violent incidents between Sikhs and Hindus, along with
					tensions between Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India, have continued into modern
					times. Outside the Punjab, however, the Sikh diaspora has generally integrated
					into society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;An updated code of conduct for contemporary Sikhism is offered in the Sikh
					Rehat Maryada, published in 1950, which gives guidance on personal and public
					life, including ceremonies and worship. However, as Guru Nanak originally
					preached, devotion to God and a socially responsible lifestyle are more
					important in Sikhism than rituals and reverence. This is reflected in the
					institution of the gurdwara, which, as well as being a temple for worship, is
					also the hub of the Sikh community. Sikh worship is generally not prescribed by
					the gurus, other than the early morning prayer, which uses the Mul Mantra
					composed by Guru Nanak as a meditation on God’s Name. This can be
					practiced anywhere, not just in the gurdwara, and because there is no priesthood
					in Sikhism, this, alongside readings and hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, can,
					in the spirit of Sikh egalitarianism, be performed by anyone.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-912"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00221.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre13"><span class="bold1">The “five Ks” of the Sikh</span>

					Nanak embarked on a 25-year mission, traveling and preaching with his companion,

					abolished the priesthood in Sikhism, which he felt had become corrupt and
					self-serving&mdash;guilty of the very vices the faith seeks to overcome.
					Instead, he appointed custodians of the holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, at
					each temple, while also permitting all Sikhs, male or female, to read from it in
					worship at the gurdwara or at home. Sikhs do not need to perform any particular
					rituals or undertake pilgrimages, but they are expected to show their devotion
					to God in their everyday lives. It is not even a requirement to worship at the
					gurdwara. These temples serve as social centers and exemplify the notion of
					community spirit that is such an important component of Sikhism. For Sikhs,
					anyone who believes in and worships one God follows the same path as Sikhism,
					and their faith deserves respect. Sikhs regard an individual’s religion
					to be largely the result of the culture in which he or she was brought up:

				religion with Catholicism. This blended, or syncretic, religion developed in Cuba
				between the 16th and 18th centuries. During this period, huge numbers of people from
				western Africa were enslaved and taken to work on the Caribbean plantations that
				were established following the Spanish colonization of the islands. The Yoruba
				people of present-day Nigeria and Benin formed the majority of those taken to the
				Cuban sugar plantations. These slaves came from the well-established Oyo Empire,
				which had a sophisticated religious tradition. This was outlawed by the Spanish.
				However, the Yoruba slaves soon learned to conceal the worship of their African gods
				by appearing to practice Catholicism. Unaware of this, the Spanish slave-owners
				dismissed the religious practices of their slaves as merely a simplistic form of
				Christian worship, and sarcastically dubbed it Santeria, the “way of the
				saints” (a term now viewed as pejorative by some).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-919"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/00366.jpeg" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Rule of Osha</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The Yoruba religion, known as Regla de Ocha or “Rule of Osha”
					(Regla Lucumí, in the Yoruba language), already had similarities to
					Catholicism. The Yoruba believe in one God, Olorun (or Olodumare), the source of
					all spiritual energy&mdash;analogous to Catholic worship of the one God. They
					also believe in a lesser pantheon of spirits known as orishas, each with an area
					of responsibility&mdash;akin to Catholic reverence of the saints. So, while
					ostensibly praying to a Catholic saint, the Yoruba slaves would communicate with
					an orisha with similar characteristics. This hybrid religion allowed the Yoruba
					to maintain contact with their culture and a link with their homeland, and, they
					believed, to communicate with their ancestors through the spirits.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid elements of the religion include the adoption of numerous Spanish words
					and the addition of images of Catholic saints alongside the traditional
					portrayals of orishas, and in some cases, the retention of the traditional
					framework of a Catholic service. Rituals are presided over by a priest or
						<i class="calibre4">santeros</i>. Hymns are replaced with
					drumming and chanting, with the aim of inducing a trance state. While in a
					trance, the believer may become possessed by spirits conveying messages from
					their ancestral home. The drums convey messages to the orisha.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a strong element of the supernatural and magic in Santeria,
					and some ceremonies call for ritual sacrifice (usually of a chicken), believers
					are insistent that black magic is not involved. They maintain that their beliefs
					are distinct from other syncretic religions of the Caribbean, such as Haitian
					voodoo.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between Santeria and Catholicism still exists today, although

				Christianity to the principles of the New Testament.</p><p class="calibre11">It was against this background that Joseph Smith, Jr. had the first of a series of
				visions, in which God and Jesus Christ came to tell him that he had been chosen to
				restore the true Church. How the Church of Christ would differ from the other
				restorationist groups was explained when Smith said an angel had guided him to find
				and translate a text, the Book of Mormon, which described how God had led his
				followers to the New World. He was told of the Great Apostasy that followed the
				ascension of Christ and the martyrdom of the Apostles, when the original Christian

					taught them, as “latter-day saints”&mdash;a term adopted by Smith
					when he established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, although
					the movement is more commonly called Mormonism. In addition to taking their lead
					from revelations, Latter-day Saints believe they should follow Jesus’s
					example. The most important consideration for them is, “What would Jesus
					do?”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;After Joseph Smith’s death, the movement divided into several branches,
					with the majority following Brigham Young (1801&ndash;1877), who set up a
					Mormon community in Utah. They hold to a strict moral code, The Word of Wisdom,
					avoiding alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and extramarital sexual activity.

					one of worldwide peace, unity, and justice. Central to his message was the
					concept of unity of religion, acceptance of the validity of all the
					world’s major religions, and respect for their prophets as messengers of
					God. With this teaching he hoped to avoid what had before now become a source of
					religious conflict, while promoting the unity of humankind and rejecting

				Jehovah’s Witnesses there is no literal second coming; rather, Jesus will at
				some unknown point begin the battle against Satan, after which God will extend the
				Kingdom of Heaven, creating an earthly paradise under Christ’s Millennial
				Reign. They believe Christ to be God’s representative ruler and not part of a

				Pan-Africanism&mdash;the movement to unite and inspire people of African

				Jamaicans, especially as large numbers lived in poverty. The vast majority of
				Jamaicans were descended from African slaves, and had been forced to adopt the

				These souls are sometimes contacted by Wiccans in magic ceremonies similar to those

				Brahma, who sits in a lotus blossom at Vishnu’s navel, and to sustain and
				protect all that Brahma creates. As well as inspiring devotion in his own right, he

				this coming together of opposites like no other deity. He embraces many dualities,
				such as life and death, time and eternity, and destruction and creation, and takes a
				multiplicity of forms. In one popular depiction he appears as Nataraja, Lord of the
				Dance. After destroying the universe, he dances its re-creation, carrying
				both fire (symbolizing destruction) and a drum (the first sound to be made at the

				forms (fearsome, wrathful, benign, and homely), but all point to her as a
				manifestation of divine power and energy. The sacred texts of the faith are the

				important activity is meditation, which they practice to empty their minds of the

				monastic existence is the ideal, there is also a place in Theravada Buddhism for lay

				Buddhism believe that Buddha has remained eternally present in this world, guiding
				others to enlightenment. In this tradition, there is no purpose to enlightenment
				unless it is used to assist other people on their spiritual path. Mahayana Buddhists
				believe other people may become buddhas, and revere those who have come close to

			is the oldest of the three main monotheistic faiths (the others being Christianity and
			Islam), all of which have roots in the Middle East. According to Moses, the patriarch to
			whom God revealed the tablets of the law, the Jews were God’s chosen people and
			received his guidance in the form of the Torah. For much of their history the Jews were
			exiled from their homeland, so followers of Judaism may be found far beyond the Jewish
			state of Israel, giving rise to geographical branches of the faith. Jews interpret their
			faith in different ways, with varying emphasis on the centrality of the Torah and Oral
			Law to their beliefs and observances.</p><div id="calibre_link-989" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">ORTHODOX JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">c.13th century BCE, Canaan</div><p class="intro">Orthodox Judaism sees itself as the continuation of the religious tradition
				developed in Canaan 3,000 years ago, and practiced by the Jews in the time of Moses.
				It is not a single movement, but is made up of many branches that share a set of
				core beliefs. At the heart of the faith is the belief that the Torah&mdash;the
				first five books of the Hebrew Bible&mdash;contains the actual words of God, and
				provides guidance on every aspect of life. From the Middle Ages, Orthodox Judaism
				was deeply rooted in Central and Eastern Europe. These communities of Jews were
				known as Ashkenazim, from the name of a patriarch. They were persecuted and
				frequently ghettoized over the centuries, and millions of Orthodox Jews in Europe
				died during the Holocaust. After World War II, many Jews traveled to the US, and
				later to the State of Israel, which was established in 1948, and where Orthodox
				Judaism is the state religion. More than 50 percent of practicing Jews consider
				themselves to be Orthodox.</p><div id="calibre_link-990" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">SEPHARDIC JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">10th century BCE, Iberia</div><p class="intro">The name Sephardic Judaism refers to the Jews who lived in Iberia
				(modern-day Portugal and Spain) from as early as the 10th century BCE, and
				their descendants. Despite some restrictions, Jews coexisted peacefully for
				centuries with Christians and then Muslims in Iberia. However, following the
				Christian conquest of Spain in 1492, and of Portugal in 1497, the Sephardim who
				resisted conversion to Christianity were expelled by Christian decree and fled to
				North Africa, Italy, France, England, the Netherlands, the Ottoman Empire, and even
				the America. Today there are thriving Sephardic communities in Israel, France,
				Mexico, the US, and Canada. Many of the fundamental beliefs of Sephardic Judaism are
				consistent with those of Orthodox Ashkenazi Judaism, though there is more emphasis
				on mysticism, and some notable differences in culture and practice, including those
				relating to language, diet, holidays, prayer, and worship.</p><div id="calibre_link-991" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">HASIDIC JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">c.1740, Mezhbizh (now in Ukraine)</div><p class="intro">Hasidic Judaism (from <i class="calibre4">hasid</i>, meaning
				“pious one”) is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that stresses a mystical
				relationship with God. Followers believe the Torah is made up of words that are in
				some sense realignments of the name of God, YHWH. A true Hasid is cut off from the
				world and meditates, prays, and studies the Torah to become closer to God. A core
				belief of Hasidism is that God is both the center of the cosmos and infinite.</p><div id="calibre_link-992" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">NEO-ORTHODOX JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">Late 19th century, Germany</div><p class="intro">The Neoorthodox movement arose out of the persecution of Jews in the West in the
				late 19th century. It provided a middle ground for those who wished neither to
				withdraw completely into Orthodox communities nor to wholly renounce them. Although
				adhering to the teachings of the Torah, Neoorthodox Judaism attempted to
				accommodate, and adapt to, the demands of the modern world. Followers consider it
				vital that Jews engage with non-Jewish people.</p><div id="calibre_link-993" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">REFORM JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1885, Pittsburgh, PA</div><p class="intro">Popular in western Europe and North America, Reform Judaism has its origins in
				19th-century efforts to update liturgy and worship in Europe. Reform Jews
				tend to see the Torah as written by a number of different writers inspired by God,
				rather than as God’s actual words. They have adapted their beliefs and
				practices to be more consistent with modern lifestyles and are accordingly less
				strict in their observances than Orthodox Jews. For example, Reform Jews have
				abandoned many traditional dietary laws and adopted new traditions, such as the
				ordination of women rabbis.</p><div id="calibre_link-994" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1887, New York City, NY</div><p class="intro">Many Jews felt that the Reform movement in the late 19th century went too far in
				rejecting the traditional tenets of their faith. As a result, in 1887, the Jewish
				Theological Seminary was founded to foster a branch of the faith that preserved the
				knowledge of historical Judaism as exemplified in the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud.
				This form of Judaism, now known as Conservative or Masorti Judaism, holds that the
				Torah and Talmud do have a divine origin, and that their laws must be followed;
				however, rabbis have a freer hand in interpreting those laws than their Orthodox
				equivalents. Many of the rulings of Conservative rabbis have been rejected by
				Orthodox Jews, but the movement has proved popular, especially in the US.</p><div id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">JEWISH SCIENCE</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1920s, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA</div><p class="intro">The Jewish Science movement was founded in the early 1920s in the US by Alfred G.
				Moses, Morris Lichtenstein, and Tehilla Lichtenstein. It is often considered to have
				been a response to the growing influence of Christian Science, as developed by <a href="#calibre_link-71" class="calibre2">Mary Baker Eddy</a> at
				the end of the 19th century. Adherents are encouraged to cultivate a sense of
				personal contentment and a positive attitude toward themselves and others. Rather
				than being regarded as a paternal figure, God is seen as an energy or force that
				permeates the universe, and as the source and restorer of health. Self-help,
				visualization, and affirmative prayer (focusing on a positive outcome) are central
				to the faith and are believed to promote both physical and spiritual well-being.
				Jewish Science acknowledges modern medicine and, unlike Christian Science, permits
				conventional medical treatment.</p><div id="calibre_link-995" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">RECONSTRUCTIONIST JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1920s&ndash;40s New York City, NY</div><p class="intro">The Reconstructionist movement was founded by Mordecai Kaplan, a
				Lithuanian-born American. He proposed a progressive approach to Judaism,
				which he regarded to be an appropriate response to modernity. This branch of Judaism
				considers the laws of the Torah to be useful only if they have a clear purpose for
				the Jewish people, or for humanity as a whole, and that the laws therefore require
				continuous reinterpretation. Some of the changes that have been effected in
				Reconstructionist Judaism are quite radical. For example, their Sabbath Prayer Book
				includes no mention of the Jews as a chosen people, and does not look forward to the
				coming of a Messiah. In place of such doctrines, Reconstructionism strives for a
				better world for all, populated by better people.</p><div id="calibre_link-996" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">HUMANISTIC JUDAISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1963, Michigan</div><p class="intro">Rabbi Sherwin T. Wine founded Humanistic Judaism in the US in the 1960s to offer
				nonreligious Jews a nontheistic alternative to the traditional religion. Humanistic
				Jews hold that Judaism is an ethnic culture formed by the Jewish people, with no
				connection to God. The tradition’s humanistic, egalitarian philosophy is
				reflected in its uplifting celebration of Jewish culture: nontheistic rituals and
				ceremonies are open to all, Jew and non-Jew, regardless of gender and sexual
				orientation. Participation in religious festivals is considered important, although
				all references to God are omitted from services, and religious passages have been
				rewritten from a secular perspective. Adherents are encouraged to focus on
				self-determination, self-help, and reason to shape their lives, rather
				than on the intervention of divine authority.</p></div></div></div></div>

				split over definitions of the nature of Christ. Like the Oriental Orthodox Church,
				of which it is part, the Armenian Church sees Christ as having one nature,
				simultaneously human and divine. Armenian Christians worship in their own language
				using a 5th-century translation of the Bible. Their churches are plain and

				humankind’s sinful nature, while the Eastern Church recognizes its essential
				goodness; the Western Church focuses on dogma, while the Eastern is more centered on
				worship. All Orthodox Churches celebrate seven sacraments, like those of the
				Catholic Church, but they are referred to as mysteries. The mystery at the heart of

				should be governed by elders. This appealed to church leaders in Scotland, keen to

				Congregationalism developed for similar reasons, especially in England, and was the

				Islamic countries, the majority of Muslims are Sunni, with the exception of Iran,
				Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Yemen, as well as some of the Gulf States. The founders of
				this form of Islam were the group of Muslims who believed that Abu Bakr, Companion
				and father-in-law of Muhammad, should succeed the Prophet as the first leader or
				caliph (literally, successor). Sunni Muslims take the Sunna, or tradition of
				Muhammad, as the model for Muslim conduct and have a further allegiance to one of
				four schools that interpret Islamic law, or <a href="#calibre_link-207" class="calibre2">shari‘a</a>:
				Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali, and Shafi’i.</p><div id="calibre_link-1023" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">SHI‘A ISLAM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">7th century CE, Arabian Peninsula</div><p class="intro">Shi‘a Islam is named after the Shi‘a ‘Ali, or Party of
				‘Ali, the group within the early Muslim community that claimed that Muhammad
				had nominated his cousin ‘Ali to lead the faith as his successor. Its largest
				branch identifies‘Ali and a continuous line of 11 descendants as the imams,
				or spiritual leaders, of Islam, whose authority is divinely sanctioned. This branch
				is known as Twelve-Imam Shi‘a, or the Twelvers. Another group of Shi‘a
				Muslims, the Seveners, does not recognize the last five imams in this lineage. Both
				groups also have doctrinal differences with Sunni Islam: for example, they hold that
				God may change his decisions (a concept called <i class="calibre4">bada’</i>).</p><div id="calibre_link-1024" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">KHARIJITES</h3></div><div class="subtitle">7th century CE, Middle East</div><p class="intro">The assassination of the third caliph, ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan, in 656 CE
				sparked a bitter conflict that split the Islamic world. At its center was a group of
				rebel Muslims responsible for the assassination, who later became known as the
				Kharijites, a name deriving from the Arabic for “to leave” or
				“exit.” They did not believe that the position of caliph should be
				inherited, but rather that it should be won by election. The sect gained a
				reputation for their extreme militancy and opposition to established authority;
				however, some Islamic scholars have interpreted their actions as an attempt to
				uphold justice. The Kharijites maintained a literal and unswerving observance of the
				Qur’an, lived puritanical lives strictly according to Islamic rule, and held
				that anyone who committed a major sin could not remain a Muslim. The early
				Kharijites were almost wiped out in their frequent uprisings, but members of a more
				moderate group survive today in North Africa, Oman, and Zanzibar.</p><div id="calibre_link-1025" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">ISMAILISM</h3></div><div class="subtitle">7th century CE, Arabian Peninsula</div><p class="intro">Ismailism is a sect of Shi‘a Islam and itself has numerous subsects,
				including the <a href="#calibre_link-208" class="calibre2">Druze</a>. The movement has its origins in the late 7th century CE,
				following a conflict within Shi‘a Islam over who should succeed Jaafar
				al-Sadiq as the sixth imam. Those who considered his son Ismail to be the rightful
				successor established a breakaway group, and became known as Ismailis. Although
				there are variations within Ismailism, its followers generally uphold fundamental
				Muslim belief with respect to the unity of God, the Prophet Muhammad, the
				Qur’an, and shari‘a law. However, among their principal doctrines is a
				belief that the religion has exterior and interior aspects, and that the exterior
				features hold hidden, inner truths that will be made clear via the imams. The
				imams’ interpretations of the Qu’ran’s hidden truths are
				regarded as binding in the community.</p><div id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">DRUZE</h3></div><div class="subtitle">11th century, Middle East</div><p class="intro">The beliefs of the sect known as the Druze developed out of Ismailite doctrine.

				(uninitiated); only the <i class="calibre4">ukkal</i> have access to the

Devotees follow a spiritual teacher and seek a
				direct and personal experience of God, which is often characterized by intense,
				ecstatic experiences, including trancelike states. The spinning of the Whirling
				Dervishes, a Sufi order, is an expression of this attempt to experience God. Because
				Sufism involves such practices, which are thought to lead to the union of the
				individual with God, Sufis have been accused of turning their backs on Islam.
				However, they insist that their experience of the love of God is the anchor of their
				Islamic faith, and that adherence to <a href="#calibre_link-87" class="calibre2">shari‘a
					law</a> is as vital to them as it is to other
				Muslims.</p><div id="calibre_link-1027" class="calibre9"><h3 class="lh1_rule_black_above">AHMADIYYA</h3></div><div class="subtitle">1889, Punjab, India</div><p class="intro">Controversy has surrounded the Ahmadiyya movement since its establishment in

				Muslim named Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, claimed not only to have been divinely inspired,
				but also to be a <a href="#calibre_link-209" class="calibre2">messiah figure</a>. This conflicted with the accepted idea of Muhammad
				as the last true prophet, and as a result most other Muslims regard followers of the
				Ahmadiyya movement as heretics. The movement does, however, share many traditional
				beliefs of Sunni Islam and accepts the Qur’an as its holy text. Adherents
				believe that the message about their version of Islam should be conveyedto
				non-Muslims as well as Muslims, and the movement has spread throughout the world,

				conduct. The movement is considered to have emerged as a reaction to the spread of
				Western, specifically European, ideology in the late 19th century; Salafists believe
				in eliminating foreign influence to ensure a return to the pure faith. They have a
				strict interpretation of the sins of shirk (idolatry) and bida’h
				(innovation), and reject kalam, or theological speculation. Followers uphold the
				precedence of <a href="#calibre_link-87" class="calibre2">shari’a law</a> and the literal truth of the Qu’ran. Salafism

				strong political agenda focused on African-American unity and rights. The Nation of
