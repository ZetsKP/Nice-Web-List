			public, and the most prone to misconceptions. Even though its language and ideas have
			infiltrated everyday culture, most people have only a hazy idea of what the subject is
			about, and what psychologists actually do. For some, psychology conjures up images of
			people in white coats, either staffing an institution for mental disorders or conducting
			laboratory experiments on rats. Others may imagine a man with a middle-European accent
			psychoanalyzing a patient on a couch or, if film scripts are to be believed, plotting to
			exercise some form of mind control.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these stereotypes are an exaggeration, some truth lies beneath them. It is
			perhaps the huge range of subjects that fall under the umbrella of psychology (and the
			bewildering array of terms beginning with the prefix “psych-”) that creates confusion
			over what psychology entails; psychologists themselves are unlikely to agree on a single
			definition of the word. “Psychology” comes from the ancient Greek <i class="calibre11">psyche</i>, meaning “soul” or “mind,” and <i class="calibre11">logia</i>, a “study” or “account,” which seems to sum up the
			broad scope of the subject, but today the word most accurately describes “the science of
			mind and behavior.”</p><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The new science</h2></div><p class="calibre10">Psychology can also be seen as a bridge between philosophy and physiology. Where
				physiology describes and explains the physical make-up of the brain and nervous
				system, psychology examines the mental processes that take place within them and how
				these are manifested in our thoughts, speech, and behavior. Where philosophy is
				concerned with thoughts and ideas, psychology studies how we come to have them and
				what they tell us about the workings of our minds.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sciences evolved from philosophy, by applying scientific methods to
				philosophical questions, but the intangible nature of subjects such as
				consciousness, perception, and memory meant that psychology was slow in making the
				transition from philosophical speculation to scientific practice. In some
				universities, particularly in the US, psychology departments started out as branches
				of the philosophy department, while in others, notably those in Germany, they were
				established in the science faculties. But it was not until the late 19th century
				that psychology became established as a scientific discipline in its own
				right.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;The founding of the world’s first laboratory of experimental psychology by Wilhelm
				Wundt at the University of Leipzig in 1879 marked the recognition of psychology as a
				truly scientific subject, and as one that was breaking new ground in previously
				unexplored areas of research. In the course of the 20th century, psychology
				blossomed; all of its major branches and movements evolved. As with all sciences,
				its history is built upon the theories and discoveries of successive generations,
				with many of the older theories remaining relevant to contemporary psychologists.
				Some areas of research have been the subject of study from psychology’s earliest
				days, undergoing different interpretations by the various schools of thought, while
				others have fallen in and out of favor, but each time they have exerted a
				significant influence on subsequent thinking, and have occasionally spawned
				completely new fields for exploration.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest way to approach the vast subject of psychology for the first time is
				to take a look at some of its main movements, as we do in this book. These occurred
				in roughly chronological order, from its roots in philosophy, through behaviorism,
				psychotherapy, and the study of cognitive, social, and developmental psychology, to
				the psychology of difference.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"Psychology has a long past, but only a short history."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">Hermann Ebbinghaus</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-153"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000143.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Two approaches</h2></div><p class="calibre10">Even in its earliest days, psychology meant different things to different people.
				In the US, its roots lay in philosophy, so the approach taken was speculative and
				theoretical, dealing with concepts such as consciousness and the self. In Europe,
				the study was rooted in the sciences, so the emphasis was on examining mental
				processes such as sensory perception and memory under controlled laboratory
				conditions. However, even the research of these more scientifically oriented
				psychologists was limited by the introspective nature of their methods: pioneers
				such as Hermann Ebbinghaus became the subject of their own investigations,
				effectively restricting the range of topics to those that could be observed in
				themselves. Although they used scientific methods and their theories laid the
				foundations for the new science, many in the next generation of psychologists found
				their processes too subjective, and began to look for a more objective
				methodology.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1890s, the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov conducted experiments that were
				to prove critical to the development of psychology in both Europe and the US. He
				proved that animals could be conditioned to produce a response, an idea that
				developed into a new movement known as behaviorism. The behaviorists felt that it
				was impossible to study mental processes objectively, but found it relatively easy
				to observe and measure behavior: a manifestation of those processes. They began to
				design experiments that could be conducted under controlled conditions, at first on
				animals, to gain an insight into human psychology, and later on humans.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorists’ studies concentrated almost exclusively on how behavior is
				shaped by interaction with the environment; this “stimulus&ndash;response” theory became
				well known through the work of John Watson. New learning theories began to spring up
				in Europe and the US, and attracted the interest of the general public.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at much the same time as behaviorism began to emerge in the US, a young
				neurologist in Vienna started to develop a theory of mind that was to overturn
				contemporary thinking and inspire a very different approach. Based on observation of
				patients and case histories rather than laboratory experiments, Sigmund Freud’s
				psychoanalytic theory marked a return to the study of subjective experience. He was
				interested in memories, childhood development, and interpersonal relationships, and
				emphasized the importance of the unconscious in determining behavior. Although his
				ideas were revolutionary at the time, they were quickly and widely adopted, and the
				notion of a “talking cure” continues within the various forms of psychotherapy
				today.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"The first fact for us then, as psychologists, is that thinking of some sort
					goes on."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold">William James</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-154"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000018.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New fields of study</h2></div><p class="calibre10">In the mid-20th century, both behaviorism and psychoanalysis fell out of favor,
				with a return to the scientific study of mental processes. This marked the beginning
				of cognitive psychology, a movement with its roots in the holistic approach of the
				Gestalt psychologists, who were interested in studying perception. Their work began
				to emerge in the US in the years following World War II; by the late 1950s,
				cognitive psychology had become the predominant approach. The rapidly growing fields
				of communications and computer science provided psychologists with a useful analogy;
				they used the model of information processing to develop theories to explain our
				methods of attention, perception, memory and forgetting, language and language
				acquisition, problem-solving and decision-making, and motivation.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even psychotherapy, which mushroomed in myriad forms from the original “talking
				cure,” was influenced by the cognitive approach. Cognitive therapy and
				cognitive-behavioral therapy emerged as alternatives to psychoanalysis, leading to
				movements such as humanist psychology, which focused on the qualities unique to
				human life. These therapists turned their attention from healing the sick to guiding
				healthy people toward living more meaningful lives.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;While psychology in its early stages had concentrated largely on the mind and
				behavior of individuals, there was now an increasing interest in the way we interact
				with our environment and other people; this became the field of social psychology.
				Like cognitive psychology, it owed much to the Gestalt psychologists, especially
				Kurt Lewin, who had fled from Nazi Germany to the US in the 1930s. Social psychology
				gathered pace during the latter half of the 20th century, when research revealed
				intriguing new facts about our attitudes and prejudices, our tendencies toward
				obedience and conformity, and our reasons for aggression or altruism, all of which
				were increasingly relevant in the modern world of urban life and ever-improving
				communications.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Freud’s continuing influence was felt mainly through the new field of
				developmental psychology. Initially concerned only with childhood development, study
				in this area expanded to include change throughout life, from infancy to old age.
				Researchers charted methods of social, cultural, and moral learning, and the ways in
				which we form attachments. The contribution of developmental psychology to education
				and training has been significant but, less obviously, it has influenced thinking
				about the relationship between childhood development and attitudes to race and
				gender.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every psychological school has touched upon the subject of human
				uniqueness, but in the late 20th century this area was recognized as a field in its
				own right in the psychology of difference. As well as attempting to identify and
				measure personality traits and the various factors that make up intelligence,
				psychologists in this growing field examine definitions and measures of normality
				and abnormality, and look at how much our individual differences are a product of
				our environment or the result of genetic inheritance.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote"><p class="calibre12">"If the 19th century was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century of

				especially in areas such as neuroscience and genetics. In particular, the nature

				continues to this day; recently, evolutionary psychology has contributed to the
				debate by exploring psychological traits as innate and biological phenomena, which
				are subject to the laws of genetics and natural selection.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychology is a huge subject, and its findings concern every one of us. In one
				form or another it informs many decisions made in government, business and industry,

				psychology confirm our instinctive feelings, just as many make us think again;
				psychologists have often shocked and outraged the public when their findings have

				unsettling truths, and provided startling insights and solutions to complex

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-102"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="calibre10">Many of the issues that are examined in modern psychology had been
				the subject of philosophical debate long before the development of science as we
				know it today. The very earliest philosophers of ancient Greece sought answers to
				questions about the world around us, and the way we think and behave. Since then we
				have wrestled with ideas of consciousness and self, mind and body, knowledge and
				perception, how to structure society, and how to live a “good life.”</p><p class="calibre13">The various branches of science evolved from philosophy, gaining momentum from the
				16th century onwards, until finally exploding into a “scientific revolution,” which
				ushered in the Age of Reason in the 18th century. While these advances in scientific
				knowledge answered many of the questions about the world we live in, they were still
				not capable of explaining the workings of our minds. Science and technology did,
				however, provide models from which we could start asking the right questions, and
				begin to test theories through the collection of relevant data.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-156"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000317.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Separating mind and body</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One of the key figures in the scientific revolution of the 17th century, the
					philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, outlined a distinction between
					mind and body that was to prove critical to the development of psychology. He
					claimed that all human beings have a dualistic existence&mdash;with a separate
					machinelike body and a non-material, thinking mind, or soul. Later psychological
					thinkers, among them Johann Friedrich Herbart, were to extend the machine
					analogy to include the brain as well, describing the processes of the mind as
					the working of the brain-machine.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree to which mind and body are separate became a topic for debate.
					Scientists wondered how much the mind is formed by physical factors, and how
					much is shaped by our environment. The “nature versus nurture” debate, fueled by
					British naturalist Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theory and taken up by Francis
					Galton, brought subjects such as free will, personality, development, and
					learning to the fore. These areas had not yet been fully described by
					philosophical inquiry, and were now ripe for scientific study. Meanwhile, the
					mysterious nature of the mind was popularized by the discovery of hypnosis,
					prompting more serious scientists to consider that there was more to the mental
					life than immediately apparent conscious thought. These scientists set out to
					examine the nature of the “unconscious,” and its influence on our thinking and
					behavior.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The birth of psychology</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Against this background, the modern science of psychology emerged. In 1879,
					Wilhelm Wundt founded the very first laboratory of experimental psychology at
					Leipzig University in Germany, and departments of psychology also began to
					appear in universities across Europe and the US. Just as philosophy had taken on
					certain regional characteristics, psychology developed in distinct ways in the
					different centers: in Germany, psychologists such as Wundt, Hermann Ebbinghaus,
					and Emil Kraepelin took a strictly scientific and experimental approach to the
					subject; while in the US, William James and his followers at Harvard adopted a
					more theoretical and philosophical approach. Alongside these areas of study, an
					influential school of thought was growing in Paris around the work of
					neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who had used hypnosis on sufferers of hysteria.
					The school attracted psychologists such as Pierre Janet, whose ideas of the
					unconscious anticipated Freud’s psychoanalytic theories.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The final two decades of the 19th century saw a rapid rise in the importance
					of the new science of psychology, as well as the establishment of a scientific
					methodology for studying the mind, in much the same way that physiology and
					related disciplines studied the body. For the first time, the scientific method
					was applied to questions concerning perception, consciousness, memory, learning,
					and intelligence, and its practices of observation and experimentation produced
					a wealth of new theories.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these ideas often came from the introspective study of the mind by
					the researcher, or from highly subjective accounts by the subjects of their
					studies, the foundations were laid for the next generation of psychologists at
					the turn of the century to develop a truly objective study of mind and behavior,
					and to apply their own new theories to the treatment of mental disorders.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

							Eysenck suggests personality is based on two dimensions.</p></div><p class="calibre10">The Roman philosopher and physician Claudius Galen formulated a
				concept of personality types based on the ancient Greek theory of humorism, which
				attempted to explain the workings of the human body.</p><p class="calibre13">The roots of humorism go back to Empedocles (c.495&ndash;435 BCE), a Greek philosopher
				who suggested that different qualities of the four basic elements&mdash;earth (cold and
				dry), air (warm and wet), fire (warm and dry), and water (cold and wet)&mdash;could
				explain the existence of all known substances. Hippocrates (460&ndash;370 BCE), the
				“Father of Medicine,” developed a medical model based on these elements, attributing
				their qualities to four fluids within the body. These fluids were called “humors”
				(from the Latin <i class="calibre11">umor</i>, meaning body fluid).</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred years later, Galen expanded the theory of humorism into one of
				personality; he saw a direct connection between the levels of the humors in the body
				and emotional and behavioral inclinations&mdash;or “temperaments.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galen’s four temperaments&mdash;sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic&mdash;are
				based on the balance of humors in the body. If one of the humors develops
				excessively, the corresponding personality type begins to dominate. A sanguine
				person has too much blood (<i class="calibre11">sanguis</i> in Latin) and
				is warm-hearted, cheerful, optimistic, and confident, but can be selfish. A
				phlegmatic person, suffering from excess phlegm (<i class="calibre11">phlegmatikós</i> in Greek), is quiet, kind, cool, rational, and
				consistent, but can be slow and shy. The choleric (from the Greek <i class="calibre11">kholé</i>, meaning bile) personality is fiery, suffering
				from excess yellow bile. Lastly, the melancholic (from the Greek <i class="calibre11">melas kholé</i>), who suffers from an excess of black bile,
				is recognized by poetic and artistic leanings, which are often also accompanied by
				sadness and fear.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-161"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000062.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Imbalance in the humors</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to Galen, some people are born predisposed to certain temperaments.
					However, since temperamental problems are caused by imbalances of the humors, he
					claimed they can be cured by diet and exercise. In more extreme cases, cures may
					include purging and blood-letting. For example, a person acting selfishly is
					overly sanguine, and has too much blood; this is remedied by cutting down on
					meat, or by making small cuts into the veins to release blood.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galen’s doctrines dominated medicine until the Renaissance, when they began to
					decline in the light of better research. In 1543, the physician Andreas Vesalius
					(1514&ndash;1564), practicing in Italy, found more than 200 errors in Galen’s
					descriptions of anatomy, but although Galen’s medical ideas were discredited, he
					later influenced 20th-century psychologists. In 1947, Hans Eysenck concluded
					that temperament is biologically based, and noted that the two personality
					traits he identified&mdash;neuroticism and extraversion&mdash;echoed the ancient
					temperaments.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although humorism is no longer part of psychology, Galen’s idea that many
					physical and mental illnesses are connected forms the basis of some modern
					therapies.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-163"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000236.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Imbalances in the humors</span> determine

				to Plato and the ancient Greeks, but it was the 17th-century philosopher René
				Descartes who first described in detail the mind-body relationship. Descartes wrote
					<i class="calibre11">De Homine</i> (“Man”), his first philosophical
				book, in 1633, in which he describes the dualism of mind and body: the non-material
				mind, or “soul,” Descartes says, is seated in the brain’s pineal gland doing the
				thinking, while the body is like a machine that operates by “animal spirits,” or
				fluids, flowing through the nervous system to cause movement. This idea had been
				popularized in the 2nd century by Galen, who attached it to his theory of the
				humors; but Descartes was the first to describe it in detail, and to emphasize the
				separation of mind and body. In a letter to the French philosopher Marin Mersenne,
				Descartes explains that the pineal gland is the “seat of thought,” and so must be
				the home of the soul, “because the one cannot be separated from the other.” This was
				important, because otherwise the soul would not be connected to any solid part of
				the body, he said, but only to the psychic spirits.</p><p class="calibre13">Descartes imagined the mind and body interacting through an awareness of the
				animal spirits that were said to flow through the body. The mind, or soul, residing
				in the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, was thought to sometimes become
				aware of the moving spirits, which then caused conscious sensation. In this way, the
				body could affect the mind. Likewise, the mind could affect the body by causing an
				outflow of animal spirits to a particular region of the body, initiating
				action.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-168"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000113.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"There is a great difference between mind and body."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">René Descartes</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-169"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000134.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Descartes illustrated the pineal gland</span>, a

					their hydraulic systems that supply water to the gardens and their elaborate
					fountains, Descartes describes the spirits of the body operating the nerves and
					muscles like the force of water, and “by this means to cause motion in all the
					parts.” The fountains were controlled by a fountaineer, and here Descartes found
					an analogy for the mind. He explained: “There is a reasoning soul in this
					machine; it has its principal site in the brain, where it is like the
					fountaineer who must be at the reservoir, whither all the pipes of the machine
					are extended, when he wishes to start, stop, or in some way alter their
					actions.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;While philosophers still argue as to whether the mind and brain are somehow
					different entities, most psychologists equate the mind with the workings of the
					brain. However, in practical terms, the distinction between mental and physical
					health is a complex one: the two being closely linked when mental stress is said
					to cause physical illness, or when chemical imbalances affect the brain.</p></div><div class="section_feature2" id="calibre_link-171"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">RENÉ DESCARTES</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-172"><img alt="" src="images/000109.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now called Descartes), France.

				Several ancient cultures, including those of Egypt and Greece, saw nothing strange
				about taking their sick to “sleep temples” so they could be cured, while in a
				sleeplike state, by suggestions from specially trained priests. In 1027, the Persian
				physician Avicenna documented the characteristics of the trance state, but its use
				as a healing therapy was largely abandoned until the German doctor Franz Mesmer
				reintroduced it in the 18th century. Mesmer’s treatment involved manipulating the
				body’s natural, or “animal,” magnetism, through the use of magnets and suggestion.
				After being “mesmerized,” or “magnetized,” some people suffered a convulsion, after
				which they claimed to feel better.</p><p class="calibre13">A few years later, Abbé Faria, a Portugese-Goan monk, studied Mesmer’s work and
				concluded that it was “entirely absurd” to think that magnets were a vital part of
				the process. The truth was even more extraordinary: the power to fall into trance or
				“lucid sleep” lay entirely with the individuals concerned. No special forces were
				necessary, because the phenomena relied only upon the power of suggestion.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-175"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000059.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Nothing comes from the magnetizer; everything comes from the subject and takes

					Sleep</i>, he describes his method: “After selecting subjects with the
					right aptitude, I ask them to relax in a chair, shut their eyes, concentrate
					their attention, and think about sleep. As they quietly await further
					instructions, I gently or commandingly say: ‘<i class="calibre11">Dormez</i>!’ (Sleep!) and they fall into lucid sleep.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It was from Faria’s lucid sleep that the term “hypnosis” was coined in 1843 by
					the Scottish surgeon James Braid, from the Greek <i class="calibre11">hypnos</i>, meaning “sleep” and <i class="calibre11">osis</i> meaning “condition.” Braid concluded that hypnosis is not a
					type of sleep but a concentration on a single idea, resulting in heightened
					suggestibility. After his death, interest in hypnosis largely waned until the
					French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot began to use hypnotism systematically in

				the mind works&mdash;in particular, how it manages ideas or concepts. Given that we each
				have a huge number of ideas over the course of our lifetime, how do we not become
				increasingly confused? It seemed to Herbart that the mind must use some kind of
				system for differentiating and storing ideas. He also wanted to account for the fact
				that although ideas exist forever (Herbart thought them incapable of being
				destroyed), some seem to exist beyond our conscious awareness. The 18th-century
				German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz was the first to explore the existence of ideas
				beyond awareness, calling them <i class="calibre11">petite</i> (“small”)
				perceptions. As an example, he pointed out that we often recall having perceived
				something&mdash;such as the detail in a scene&mdash;even though we are not aware of noticing it
				at the time. This means that we perceive things and store a memory of them despite
				the fact that we are unaware of doing so.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-182"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000366.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dynamic ideas</h2></div><p class="calibre14">According to Herbart, ideas form as information from the senses combines. The
					term he used for ideas&mdash;<i class="calibre11">Vorsfellung</i>&mdash;
					encompasses thoughts, mental images, and even emotional states. These make up
					the entire content of the mind, and Herbart saw them not as static but dynamic
					elements, able to move and interact with one another. Ideas, he said, can
					attract and combine with other ideas or feelings, or repulse them, rather like
					magnets. Similar ideas, such as a color and tone, attract each other and combine
					to form a more complex idea. However, if two ideas are unalike, they may
					continue to exist without association. This causes them to weaken over time, so
					that they eventually sink below the “threshold of consciousness.” Should two
					ideas directly contradict one another, “resistance occurs” and “concepts become
					forces when they resist one another.” They repel one another with an energy that
					propels one of them beyond consciousness, into a place that Herbart referred to
					as “a state of tendency;” and we now know as “the unconscious.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Herbart saw the unconscious as simply a kind of storage place for weak or
					opposed ideas. In positing a two-part consciousness, split by a distinct
					threshold, he was attempting to deliver a structural solution for the management
					of ideas in a healthy mind. But Sigmund Freud was to see it as a much more
					complex and revealing mechanism. He combined Herbart’s concepts with his own
					theories of unconscious drives to form the basis of the 20th-century’s most
					important therapeutic approach: psychoanalysis.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-184"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000343.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Thoughts and feelings</span> contain energy,

				of the ancient Greeks. Socrates (470&ndash;399 BCE) believed the main purpose of
				philosophy is to increase happiness through analyzing and understanding oneself,
				famously saying: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” Søren Kierkegaard’s book
					<i class="calibre11">The Sickness Unto Death</i> (1849) offers
				self-analysis as a means to understanding the problem of “despair,” which he
				considered to stem not from depression, but rather from the alienation of the
				self.</p><p class="calibre13">Kierkegaard described several levels of despair. The lowest, and most common,
				stems from ignorance: a person has the wrong idea about what “self” is, and is
				unaware of the existence or nature of his potential self. Such ignorance is close to
				bliss, and so inconsequential that Kierkegaard was not even sure it could be counted
				as despair. Real desperation arises, he suggested, with growing self-awareness, and
				the deeper levels of despair stem from an acute consciousness of the self, coupled
				with a profound dislike of it. When something goes wrong, such as failing an exam to
				qualify as a doctor, a person may seem to be despairing over something that has been
				lost. But on closer inspection, according to Kierkegaard, it becomes obvious that
				the man is not really despairing of the thing (failing an exam) but of himself. The
				self that failed to achieve a goal has become intolerable. The man wanted to become
				a different self (a doctor), but he is now stuck with a failed self and in
				despair.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-189"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000241.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Abandoning the real self</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Kierkegaard took the example of a man who wanted to become an emperor, and
					pointed out that ironically, even if this man did somehow achieve his aim, he
					would have effectively abandoned his old self. In both his desire and
					accomplishment, he wants to “be rid of” his self. This disavowal of the self is
					painful: despair is overwhelming when a man wants to shun himself&mdash;when he “does
					not possess himself; he is not himself.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Kierkegaard did offer a solution. He concluded that a man can find
					peace and inner harmony by finding the courage to be his true self, rather than
					wanting to be someone else. “To will to be that self which one truly is, is
					indeed the opposite of despair,” he said. He believed that despair evaporates
					when we stop denying who we really are and attempt to uncover and accept our
					true nature.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kierkegaard’s emphasis on individual responsibility, and the need to find
					one’s true essence and purpose in life, is frequently regarded as the beginning
					of existentialist philosophy. His ideas led directly to R.D. Laing’s use of
					existential therapy, and have influenced the humanistic therapies practiced by
					clinical psychologists such as Carl Rogers.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-191"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000246.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Napoleon’s overreaching</span> ambition for

					1840, he became engaged to Regine Olsen, but broke off the engagement, saying
					that he was unsuited to marriage. His general state of melancholy had a profound

				including the evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin. So it’s not surprising that
				Galton was interested in the extent to which abilities are either inborn or learned.
				He was the first person to identify “nature” and “nurture” as two separate
				influences whose effects could be measured and compared, maintaining that these two
				elements alone were responsible for determining personality. In 1869 he used his own
				family tree, as well as those of “judges, statesmen, commanders, scientists,
				literary men… diviners, oarsmen, and wrestlers,” to research inherited traits for
				his book <i class="calibre11">Hereditary Genius</i>. As predicted, he
				found more highly talented individuals in certain families than among the general
				population. However, he could not safely attribute this to nature alone, as there
				were also conferred benefits from growing up in a privileged home environment.
				Galton himself grew up in a wealthy household with access to unusually good
				educational resources.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-196"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000168.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Characteristics cling to families."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Francis Galton</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A necessary balance</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Galton proposed a number of other studies, including the first large survey by
					questionnaire, which was sent out to members of the Royal Society to inquire
					about their interests and affiliations. Publishing his results in <i class="calibre11">English Men of Science</i>, he claimed that where
					nature and nurture are forced to compete, nature triumphs. External influences
					can make an impression, he says, but nothing can “efface the deeper marks of
					individual character.” However, he insists that both nature and nurture are
					essential in forming personality, since even the highest natural endowments may
					be “starved by defective nurture.” Intelligence, he says, is inherited, but must
					be fostered through education.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1875, Galton undertook a study of 159 pairs of twins. He found that they
					did not follow the “normal” distribution of similarity between siblings, in
					which they are moderately alike, but were always extremely similar or extremely
					dissimilar. What really surprised him was that the degree of similarity never
					changed over time. He had anticipated that a shared upbringing would lessen
					dissimilarity between twins as they grew up, but found that this was not the
					case. Nurture seemed to play no role at all.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “nature&mdash;nurture debate” continues to this day. Some people have favored
					Galton’s theories, including his notion&mdash;now known as eugenics&mdash;that people could
					be “bred” like horses to promote certain characteristics. Others have preferred
					to believe that every baby is a tabula rasa, or “blank slate,” and we are all
					born equal. Most psychologists today recognize that nature and nurture are both
					crucially important in human development, and interact in complex ways.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-198"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000141.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Galton’s study of twins</span> looked for

					consisting “of a series of clinical states which hold as their common a peculiar
					destruction of the internal connections of the psychic personality.” He observed
					that the illness, characterized by confusion and antisocial behavior, often
					starts in the late teens or early adulthood. Kraepelin later divided it into
					four subcategories. The first, “simple” dementia, is marked by slow decline and
					withdrawal. The second, paranoia, manifests in patients as a state of fear and
					persecution; they report being “spied upon” or “talked about.” The third,
					hebephrenia, is marked by incoherent speech, and often by inappropriate
					emotional reactions and behavior, such as laughing loudly at a sad situation.
					The fourth category, catatonia, is marked by extremely limited movement and
					expression, often in the form of either rigidness, such as sitting in the same
					position for hours, or excessive activity, such as rocking backward and forward
					repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraepelin’s classification still forms the basis of schizophrenia diagnosis.
					In addition, postmortem investigations have shown that there are biochemical and
					structural brain abnormalities, as well as impairments of brain function, in
					schizophrenia sufferers. Kraepelin’s belief that a great number of mental
					illnesses are strictly biological in origin exerted a lasting influence on the
					field of psychiatry, and many mental disorders are still managed with medication

							complex memory, and perhaps consciousness itself.</p></div><p class="calibre10">The idea that nonhuman animals have minds and are capable of some
				form of thought dates back to the ancient Greek philosophers. Aristotle believed
				that there are three kinds of mind: plant, animal, and human. The plant mind is
				concerned only with nutrition and growth. The animal mind has these functions, but
				can also experience sensations, such as pain, pleasure, and desire, as well as
				initiating motion. The human mind can do all this and reason; Aristotle claims that
				only humans have self-awareness and are capable of higher-level cognition. The
				similarity of humans to animals was a critical issue for philosophers, but even more
				so for psychologists. In the 15th century, the French philosopher René Descartes
				claimed that animals are no more than reflex-driven, complex machines. If Descartes
				was correct, observing animals could tell us nothing about our own behavior.
				However, when Charles Darwin asserted some 200 years later that humans are linked to
				other animals genetically, and that consciousness operates from the creatures at the
				very lowest end of the evolutionary scale to ourselves, it became clear that
				experiments on animals might be revealing. This was the position held by the German
				physician, philosopher, and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, who described a continuum of
				life from even the smallest animals to ourselves. In his book <i class="calibre11">Principles of Physiological Psychology</i>, he claimed that
				consciousness is a universal possession of all living organisms, and has been since
				the evolutionary process began.</p><p class="calibre13">To Wundt, the very definition of life includes having some kind of mind. He
				declared: “From the standpoint of observation, then, we must regard it as a highly
				probable hypothesis that the beginnings of the mental life date from as far back as
				the beginnings of life at large. The question of the origin of mental development
				thus resolves itself into the question of the origin of life.” Wundt went on to say
				that even simple organisms such as protozoa have some form of mind. This last claim
				is surprising today, when few people would expect a single-celled animal to
				demonstrate even simple mental abilities, but it was even more surprising when first
				stated more than 100 years ago.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wundt was keen to test out his theories, and he is often called “the father of
				experimental psychology” because he set up the world’s first formal laboratory of
				experimental psychology in Leipzig University, Germany, in 1879. He wanted to carry
				out systematic research on the mind and behavior of humans, initially through
				subjecting the basic sensory processes to close examination. His laboratory inspired
				other universities in the US and Europe to set up psychology departments, many of
				which were modeled on his original laboratory and were led by pupils such as Edward
				Titchener and James Cattell.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-209"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000273.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-210"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000224.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Wundt’s laboratory</span> set the style for

					experimental psychology.” Although he understood consciousness as an “inner
					experience,” he was only interested in the “immediately real” or apparent form
					of this experience. This ultimately led him to the study of behavior, which
					could be studied and quantified by “direct observation.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wundt said that there are two types of observation: external and internal.
					External observation is used to record events that are visible in the external
					world, and is useful in assessing relationships such as cause and effect on
					physical bodies&mdash;for example, in stimulus and response experiments. If a nerve
					fiber in a dead frog is given a small electric shock, the connecting muscles
					twitch, causing the legs to move. The fact that this happens even in a dead
					animal illustrates that such movements can occur without any consciousness. In
					living creatures, such actions are the basis of the automatic behavior that we
					call “reflexes,” such as immediately moving your hand when you touch something
					hot.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wundt’s second type of observation, termed “introspection” or
					“self-observation,” is internal observation. This involves noticing and
					recording internal events such as thoughts and feelings. It is crucial in
					research because it provides information about how the mind is working. Wundt
					was interested in the relationship between the inner and outer worlds, which he
					did not see as mutually exclusive, but as interactive, describing it as
					“physical and psychical.” He began to concentrate on the study of human
					sensations, such as the visual sensation of light, because these are the
					agencies that link the external physical world and the internal mental
					world.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In one experiment, Wundt asked individuals to report on their sensations when
					shown a light signal&mdash;which was standardized to a specific color and a certain
					level of brightness, and shone for a fixed length of time. This ensured that
					each participant experienced exactly the same stimulus, enabling responses of
					different participants to be compared and the experiment to be repeated at a
					later date, if required. In insisting upon this possibility for replication,
					Wundt set the standard for all future psychological experiments.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sensory experiments, Wundt set out to explore human consciousness in a
					measurable way. He refused to see it as an unknowable, subjective experience
					that is unique to each individual. In the light-response experiments, he was
					particularly interested in the amount of time between a person receiving some
					form of stimulus and making a voluntary reaction to it (rather than an
					involuntary one), and he used various instruments to measure this response
					exactly. He was also just as interested to hear what his participants reported
					in common as he was in apparent individual differences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure sensations, Wundt suggested, have three components: quality, intensity,
					and “feeling-tone.” For example, a certain perfume may have a sweet odor
					(quality) that is distinct but faint (intensity) and is pleasant to smell
					(feeling-tone), while a dead rat might give off a nauseating (quality), strong
					(intensity) stench (feeling-tone). All consciousness originates in sensations,
					he said, but these are not internalized as “pure” sensory data; instead, they
					are perceived as already collected or compounded into representations, such as a
					dead rat. Wundt called these “images of an object or of a process in the
					external world.” So, for example, if we see a face with certain features&mdash;mouth
					shape, eye color, nose size, and so on&mdash;we may recognize the face as a person we
					know.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The exact description of consciousness is the sole aim of experimental
						psychology."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Wilhelm Wundt</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-212"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000199.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Our sensations provide details</span> of

					three major categories of actions&mdash;representation, willing, and feeling&mdash;which
					together form an impression of a unitary flow of events. Representations are
					either “perceptions,” if they represent an image in the mind of an object
					perceived in the external world (such as a tree within eyesight), or
					“intuitions” if they represent a subjective activity (such as remembering a
					tree, or imagining a unicorn). He named the process through which a perception
					or intuition becomes clear in consciousness “apperception.” So, for example, you
					may perceive a sudden loud noise and then apperceive that it is a warning sign,
					meaning that you are about to be hit by a car if you don’t get out of the way
					quickly enough.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The willing category of consciousness is characterized by the way it
					intervenes in the external world; it expresses our volition, or “will,” from
					raising an arm to choosing to wear red. This form of consciousness is beyond
					experimental control or measurement. However, Wundt found that the third
					category of consciousness, feeling, could be measured through subjective reports
					from experimental participants, or through measuring levels of behavior such as
					tension and relaxation or excitement.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cultural psychology</h2></div><p class="calibre14">For Wundt, the psychological development of a person is determined not only by
					sensations but also by complex social and cultural influences, which cannot be
					replicated or controlled in an experimental situation. He included religion,
					language, myths, history, art, laws, and customs among these influences,
					discussing them in a ten-volume work, <i class="calibre11">Cultural
						Psychology</i>, which he wrote during the last 20 years of his
					life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wundt saw language as an especially important part of culture’s contribution
					to consciousness. Any verbal communication begins with a “general impression”,
					or unified idea of something we wish to say. Having “apperceived” this general
					starting point, we then choose words and sentences to express it. While
					speaking, we monitor the accuracy of the intended meaning. We might say, “No,
					that’s not right, I mean…,” and then choose a different word or phrase to
					express ourselves better. Whoever is listening has to understand the meaning
					that the speaker is trying to convey, but the actual words may not be as
					important as the general impression, especially if strong emotions are involved.
					As evidence of the fact that we use this process, Wundt points out that we often
					remember the general meaning of what a person has said long after we’ve
					forgotten the specific words that were used.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to use true language, as opposed to just exchanging limited signs
					and signals, is today considered by many psychologists to be a key difference
					between human beings and the rest of the animal kingdom. There may be a few
					exceptions, including nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, but language is
					generally considered to be a human ability that is very important in
					consciousness.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"In the course of normal speaking… the will is continuously directed to

					fundamentally changed since Wundt. The level of consciousness within animals has
					not yet been established, and this has led to the formation of special Codes of
					Ethics for animal experiments, intensive farming, and blood sports such as fox
					hunting and bull fighting. Of particular concern is whether animals experience
					discomfort, fear, and pain in ways that resemble the form in which we feel them
					ourselves. The fundamental question of which animals have self-awareness or
					consciousness remains unanswered, although few psychologists today would assume,
					as Wundt did, that it applies even to the microscopic protozoa.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The beginnings of a differentiation of mental function can be found even

					from the age of 13. He went on to study at the universities of Berlin, Tübingen,
					and Heidelberg, graduating in medicine in 1856.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later, Wundt became assistant to the physician Hermann von

				individual’s awareness of his or her own thoughts, including sensations, feelings,
				and memories. We usually take this awareness for granted, except when we are having
				difficulties&mdash;such as trying to do something when we are very tired. But if you focus
				your thoughts on your consciousness, you soon become aware that your conscious
				experiences are constantly changing. While reading this book, for example, you may
				be reminded of past experiences or present discomforts that interrupt your
				concentration; plans for the future may spontaneously spring to mind. Thinking about
				your conscious experiences makes you realize just how much your thoughts are
				changing, and yet they seem to come together, merging and carrying on smoothly as a
				whole.</p><p class="calibre13">American psychologist William James compared these everyday experiences of
				consciousness to a stream that continuously flows, despite the odd interruption and
				change of direction. He declared: “A ‘river’ or a ‘stream’ are the metaphors by
				which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the
				stream of thought, of consciousness.…”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;James’s famous description of the “stream… of consciousness” is one that almost
				everyone can identify with, because we all experience it. Yet, at the same time,
				James points out that it is very hard to actually define: “When I say every thought
				is part of a personal consciousness, ‘personal consciousness’ is one of the terms in
				question… to give an accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic
				tasks.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;This “most difficult of philosophic tasks” has a long history. The ancient Greeks
				discussed the mind, but did not use the term “consciousness” or any equivalent.
				However, there was debate as to whether something separate from the body exists at
				all. In the fourth century BCE, Plato made a distinction between the soul and the
				body, but Aristotle argued that even if there is a distinction, the two cannot be
				separated.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-221"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000119.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Consciousness… does not appear to itself chopped up in bits… It is nothing

					attempt to describe consciousness, proposing that it resides in an immaterial
					domain he called “the realm of thought,” in contrast to the physical domain of
					material things, which he called “the realm of extension.” However, the first
					person accredited with the modern concept of consciousness as an ongoing passage
					of individual perceptions is the 17th-century English philosopher John Locke.
					James was drawn to Locke’s idea of passing perceptions and also to the work of
					the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant was impressed by the way
					our experiences come together, noting that if we hear a noise and feel pain at
					the same time, we typically experience these as one event. He called this the
					“unity of consciousness,” a concept that influenced many later philosophers,
					including William James.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;James felt the most important point about consciousness is that it is not a
					“thing” but a process&mdash;it is what the brain does to “steer a nervous system grown
					too complex to regulate itself.” It allows us to reflect upon the past, present,
					and future, to plan and adapt to circumstances and so fulfill what he believed
					was the prime purpose of consciousness&mdash;to stay alive.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But James found it hard to imagine the structure of a unified consciousness.
					He likened it to a group of 12 men: “Take a dozen words, take twelve men, and to
					each give one word. Then stand the men in a row or jam, and let each think of
					his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be a consciousness of the
					whole sentence.” If consciousness is a stream of distinct thoughts, James
					struggled to see how these combine. As he said, “The idea of <i class="calibre11">a</i> plus the idea of <i class="calibre11">b</i> is not identical with the idea of <i class="calibre11">(a +
						b)</i>.” Two thoughts added together cannot be made into one idea.
					They are more likely to form an entirely new idea. For example, if thought
						<i class="calibre11">a</i> is “it’s nine o’clock,” and thought
						<i class="calibre11">b</i> is “the train leaves at 9:02,” thought
						<i class="calibre11">c</i>&mdash;“I’m going to miss my train!”&mdash;might
					follow.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-223"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000098.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The 12-word sentence problem</span> was used
							by James to illustrate his difficulty in grasping how a unified
							consciousness stems from separate thoughts. If each man is aware of just
							one word, how can there be a consciousness of the whole sentence?</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Combining thoughts</h2></div><p class="calibre14">James concluded that the simplest way to understand how thoughts within the
					stream of consciousness might combine to make sense is to suppose “that things
					that are known together are known in single pulses of that stream.” Some
					thoughts, or sensations, he believed, are unavoidably connected, like Kant’s
					example of hearing a noise and feeling pain at precisely the same time, because
					any thoughts that enter our awareness during the same moment of time combine to
					form a pulse, or current, within the stream. We may have many of these currents
					flowing through our consciousness, some fast and some slow. James stated that
					there are even resting points, where we pause to form pictures in our minds,
					which can be held and contemplated at length. He called the resting places
					“substantive parts,” and the moving currents the “transitive parts,” claiming
					that our thinking is constantly being dislodged from one substantive part toward
					another, propelled by the transitive parts, or current. We are, therefore,
					effectively “bumped” from one conclusion to another by the constant stream of
					thoughts, whose purpose is to pull us ever forwards in this way. There is no
					final conclusion; consciousness is not a thing but a process, which is
					constantly evolving.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;James also drew attention to the personal nature of consciousness, stating
					that thoughts do not exist independently of a thinker&mdash;they are your thoughts or
					mine. Each one is “owned” by someone, and never “comes into direct sight of a
					thought in another personal consciousness than its own.” And it is these
					thoughts “connected as we feel them to be connected” that form the self. As
					thoughts cannot be divided from the self, James said that investigating this
					self should be the starting point of psychology. Experimental psychologists did
					not agree, because “the self” cannot be offered up for experimentation, but
					James thought it was enough to work with our understanding of a self that does
					certain things and feels in certain ways. He called this the “empirical self”,
					which manifests itself through its behavior, and suggested that it consists of
					several parts&mdash;the material self, spiritual self, and social self&mdash;each of which
					can be studied through introspection.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"No-one ever had a simple sensation by itself: consciousness… is of a

					the emotions play an important role in our daily lives, and went on to develop,
					with his colleague Carl Lange, a theory about how they relate to our actions and
					behavior. What was to become known as the James&mdash;Lange Theory of Emotion states
					that emotions arise from your conscious mind’s perception of your physiological
					condition. To illustrate this theory, James used the example of seeing a bear,
					then running away. It is not the case that you see the bear, feel afraid, and
					then run away because of the fear. What is really happening is that you see the
					bear and run away, and the conscious feeling of fear is caused by the action of
					running. This contradicts what most people might think, but James’s view was
					that the mind’s perception of the physical effects of running&mdash;rapid breathing,
					increased heartbeat, and perspiring heavily&mdash;is translated into the emotion of
					fear. Another example, according to his theory, would be that you feel happy

					first, and then smile.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Pragmatism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Related to James’s theories about consciousness is his approach to the way we
					believe things to be true or not. He stated that “truths emerge from facts… but…
					the ‘facts’ themselves meanwhile are not true; they simply are. Truth is the
					function of the beliefs that start and terminate among them.” James defined
					“true beliefs” as those that the believer finds useful. This emphasis on the
					usefulness of beliefs lies at the heart of the American philosophical tradition
					of pragmatism, which was central to James’s thinking.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of our lives, James claimed that we are continually testing
					“truths” against each other, and our conscious beliefs keep changing, as “old
					truths” are modified, and sometimes replaced by “new truths.” This theory is
					particularly relevant to the way that all scientific research, including
					psychology, progresses. James cited the discovery of the radioactive element
					radium by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1902 as an example. In the course of their
					investigations, the Curies found that radium appeared to give off unlimited
					amounts of energy, which “seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the
					whole order of nature.” However, after conscious consideration of this
					revelation, they concluded that “although it extends our old ideas of energy, it
					causes a minimum of alteration in their nature.” In this instance, the Curies’
					scientific knowledge had been questioned and modified, but its core truths
					remained intact.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"There is but one indefectibly certain truth… the truth that the present

					and a decline of interest in consciousness. Consequently, little theorizing on
					the subject happened from around the start of the 1920s up until the 1950s. One
					important exception was the German-based Gestalt movement, which emphasized that
					the brain operates in a holistic way, taking account of whole conscious
					experiences, rather than separate events&mdash;just as when we look at a picture, we
					see not just separate dots, lines, and shapes, but a meaningful whole. This
					concept is behind the now famous Gestalt phrase: “The whole is greater than the
					sum of the parts.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s, however, psychologists and neuroscientists have developed a
					new field of research called “consciousness studies,” focusing on two main areas
					of interest: the content of consciousness, as reported by people who are
					considered to be normal and healthy; and the consciousness of people whose state
					of awareness has been impaired in some way. The latter group includes cases,
					such as when the subject is in a “persistent vegetative state” (PVS)&mdash;in which
					patients in a coma are awake and breathing independently, but have apparently
					lost all higher brain functions. The goal with both paths of research is to try
					to find ways of assessing consciousness as objectively as possible, and to
					understand its underlying mechanisms&mdash;both physical and psychological.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern neuroscience has demonstrated that there are mechanisms of
					consciousness. By the closing years of the 20th century, the British molecular
					biologist and biophysicist Francis Crick was claiming that consciousness is
					related to a specific part of the brain&mdash;the prefrontal cortex area, which is
					involved in thought processes such as planning, problem-solving, and the control
					of behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Research carried out by the Colombian neuroscientist Rodolfo Linas links
					consciousness to the activities of the thalamus in conjunction with the cerebral
					cortex. The thalamus, a structure embedded deep in the center of the brain, is
					responsible for regulating vibrations inside the brain at certain frequencies;
					if these regular rhythms are disrupted&mdash;by an infection or genetic causes&mdash;then
					an individual may experience neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and
					Parkinson’s disease, as well as psychological conditions, such as
					depression.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it comes to definitions of consciousness, modern attempts still
					remain vague and difficult to apply. For example, the American neuroscientist
					Antonio Damasio calls consciousness “the feeling of what happens,” and defines
					it as “an organism’s awareness of its own self and its surroundings.” As William
					James suggested, more than 100 years earlier, consciousness is hard to
					define.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-230"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000138.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">MRI scans of the brain</span> have helped to

						of Psychology</i>, is still in print, and his ideas have been a major
					influence on many psychologists, as well as other scientists and thinkers. The
					application of his pragmatic philosophy to facts&mdash;concentrating not on what is
					“true” but on what it is “useful to believe”&mdash;has helped psychology move on from
					the question of whether the mind and body are separate or not to a more useful
					study of mental processes, such as attention, memory, reasoning, imagination,
					and intention. James claimed his approach helped to move philosophers and
					psychologists “away from abstraction, fixed principles, closed systems, and
					pretended absolutes and origins, towards facts, action, and power.” His
					insistence on focusing on the wholeness of events, including the effects of
					different environments on our actions&mdash;in contrast to the introspective,
					structuralist approach of breaking down our experiences into small details&mdash;has
					also shaped our understanding of behavior. Before James started teaching the
					subject at Harvard in 1875, there were no independent psychology courses
					available in any American university. But within 20 years, around 24 colleges
					and universities in the US had recognized psychology as a distinct academic
					discipline, and were offering degrees in the subject. Three specialist
					psychology journals were also founded in that time, and a professional
					organization&mdash;the American Psychological Association&mdash;was formed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;James introduced experimental psychology to America, despite claiming to “hate
					experimental work.” He did so because he had come to realize that it was the
					best way to prove or disprove a theory. But he continued to value the use of
					introspection as a tool of discovery, especially of mental processes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift in the perception of psychology and its concerns from being
					considered, “a nasty little subject” (in James’s words) into a vastly beneficial
					discipline owes much to his work. In 1977, in a speech celebrating the 75th
					anniversary of the formation of the American Psychological Association, David
					Krech, then Professor Emeritus in psychology at the University of California at
					Berkeley, referred to James as the “father of psychology.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"All these consciousnesses melt into each other like dissolving views.

					until the age of 23. Modern research acknowledges a similar pattern. The causes
					of depression that Hall identified are startlingly familiar: suspicion of being
					disliked and having seemingly insuperable character faults, and “the fancy of
					hopeless love.” He believed the self-consciousness of adolescence leads to
					self-criticism and censoriousness of self and others. This view mirrors later
					studies, which argue that teenagers’ advanced reasoning skills allow them to
					“read between the lines,” while also magnifying their sensitivity to situations.
					Even Hall’s claim that criminal activity is more prevalent in the teenage years,
					peaking around 18, still holds true.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hall was not totally negative about adolescence. As he wrote in <i class="calibre11">Youth: Its Education, Regiment, and Hygiene</i>,
					“Adolescence is a new birth, for the higher and more completely human traits are

					recall. To avoid the use of association, he then created 2,300 “nonsense
					syllables,” all three letters long and using the standard word format of
					consonant&mdash;vowel&mdash;consonant: for example, “ZUC” and “QAX.” Grouping these into
					lists, he looked at each syllable for a fraction of a second, pausing for 15
					seconds before going through a list again. He did this until he could recite a
					series correctly at speed. He tested different list lengths and different
					learning intervals, noting the speed of learning and forgetting.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebbinghaus found that he could remember meaningful material, such as a poem,
					ten times more easily than his nonsense lists. He also noted that the more times
					the stimuli (the nonsense syllables) were repeated, the less time was needed to
					reproduce the memorized information. Also, the first few repetitions proved the
					most effective in memorizing a list.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at his results for evidence of forgetting, Ebbinghaus found,
					unsurprisingly, that he tended to forget less quickly the lists that he had
					spent the most time memorizing, and that recall is best performed immediately
					after learning. Ebbinghaus also uncovered an unexpected pattern in memory
					retention. He found that there is typically a very rapid loss of recall in the
					first hour, followed by a slightly slower loss, so that after nine hours, about
					60 percent is forgotten. After 24 hours, about two-thirds of anything memorized
					is forgotten. Plotted on a graph, this shows a distinct “forgetting curve” that
					starts with a sharp drop, followed by a shallow slope.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebbinghaus’s research launched a new field of enquiry, and helped establish

					He was largely self-taught, although working with Jean-Martin Charcot at Paris’s
					Salpêtrière Hospital for more than seven years gave him a firm grasp of
					experimental procedures, with their need for precision and careful planning. His
					desire to study human intelligence grew out of his fascination with the
					development of his own two daughters. He noted that the speed and ease with
					which his children absorbed new information varied according to how much they
					were paying attention. Context, and the child’s frame of mind, seemed to be
					critical to learning.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing of Francis Galton’s testing in London, Binet decided to carry out
					his own large-scale research on assessing differences in individual abilities
					between various special-interest groups, such as mathematicians, chess players,
					writers, and artists. At the same time, he continued his study of the functional
					intelligence of children, noting that they became capable of certain skills at
					specific ages. For example, very young children were not capable of abstract
					thought&mdash;this seemed to be a hallmark of an increased level of intelligence that
					was directly attributable to age.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1899, Binet was invited to join a new organization dedicated to educational
					research, La Société Libre pour L’Etude Psychologique de l’Enfant (The Free
					Society for the Psychological Study of the Child). Within a short time, he
					became the group’s leader, and began to publish articles and information useful
					to teachers and education officials. Around the same time, it became mandatory
					for all children in France to attend school between the ages of six and 12, and
					Binet was asked to consider how to develop a test that would identify children
					who might have learning disabilities, so that they could receive schooling that
					was appropriate to their needs. In 1904, this work led to Binet being asked to
					join a government commission to devise a method of assessing learning potential
					in infants, and he made it his mission to establish the differences between

					Sorbonne’s Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, where Binet had been director
					since 1894. It was to be the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration
					between the two scientists.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1905, Binet and Simon had created their first test, labeled “New Methods
					for Diagnosing Idiocy, Imbecility, and Moron Status.” Soon after, they
					introduced a revised version, for children aged three to 13, which was simply
					called the Binet&mdash;Simon Scale. It was revised once more in 1908, and then again
					in 1911.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on their many years of observing children, Binet and Simon put together
					30 tests of increasing difficulty, using a range of tasks that reflected the
					average abilities of children at different ages. The easiest tasks included
					following a beam of light, or engaging in basic conversation with the person who
					was testing them. Slightly more difficult tasks included pointing to various
					named body parts, repeating a series of two digits, repeating simple sentences,
					and defining basic words such as “house” or “fork.” In the more difficult tests,
					children were asked to describe the difference between pairs of similar objects,
					to reproduce drawings from memory, and to construct sentences around three given
					words. The very hardest tasks included repeating seven random digits, finding
					three rhymes for the French word “obéisance;” and answering questions such as
					“My neighbor has been receiving strange visitors. He has received in turn a
					doctor, a lawyer, and then a priest. What is taking place?”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet and Simon tested their Scale on a sample of 50 children, divided equally
					between five age groups. These children had been selected by their school
					teachers as being average for their age, providing a baseline measure of
					normality against which children of all abilities could be measured.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet and Simon’s 30 tasks, arranged in order of difficulty, were to be
					carried out under carefully controlled conditions. Binet had learned from
					observing his daughters that children are easily distracted, and that their
					level of attention plays a critical role in their ability to perform. He saw
					intelligence as a mixture of multifaceted mental faculties that operate within a
					real world of ever-changing circumstances, and are controlled by practical
					judgment.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"There is in intelligence… a fundamental agency, the lack or alteration of
						which has the greatest importance for practical life: that is
						judgment."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Alfred Binet</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-253"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000127.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Binet&mdash;Simon tests</span> generate an IQ

					keen to point out that the scale simply ordered children from their performance
					of intellectual tasks in relation to other children of a similar age. The tests
					of 1908 and 1911 placed greater emphasis on tests for different age groups, and
					it was this that eventually led to the concept of “mental age.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet also stressed that mental development progressed at different rates and
					could be influenced by environmental factors. He preferred to think of his tests
					as a way of assessing mental level at a particular point in time, because this
					allowed for an individual’s level to change as their circumstances changed. This
					was in opposition to the views of the influential English psychologist Charles
					Spearman, who later proposed that intelligence was based on biological factors
					alone.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet maintained that a child’s “intelligence is not a fixed quantity,” but
					grows just as the child does, and that even though he had devised a way of
					quantifying it, no number could ever give an accurate measure of a person’s
					intelligence. A complete picture, Binet thought, could only be formed from an
					accompanying case study. Ultimately, Binet did not believe that it was possible
					to measure intellectual aptitude as if it were a length or a capacity; it was
					only possible to classify it.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Uses and abuses</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In 1908, the American psychologist Henry H. Goddard traveled to Europe, where
					he discovered the Binet&mdash;Simon tests. He translated them, distributing around
					22,000 copies across the US to be used for testing in schools. Unfortunately,
					while Binet had been careful not to attribute intelligence to hereditary
					factors, Goddard thought that it was genetically determined. He saw the
					Binet&mdash;Simon Scale as a way of rooting out “feebleminded people” for compulsory
					sterilization.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1916, yet another American psychologist, Lewis Terman, modified the
					Binet&mdash;Simon Scale. Using test results from a large sample of American children,
					he renamed it the Stanford&mdash;Binet Scale. It was no longer used solely to identify
					children with special needs, but to pick out those who might be suitable for
					streaming off into more vocational, or job-oriented, education, effectively
					condemning them to a lifetime of menial work. Terman, like Goddard, believed
					that intelligence was inherited and unchangeable, so no amount of schooling
					could alter it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet was probably unaware of these uses of his work for quite some time. He
					was an isolated figure, who rarely concerned himself with professional
					developments outside his immediate sphere. He never traveled outside France,
					where the Binet&mdash;Simon Scale was not adopted during his lifetime, so he was never
					confronted by any modifications of his work. When he eventually became aware of
					the “foreign ideas being grafted on his instrument” he strongly condemned those
					who with “brutal pessimism” and “deplorable verdicts” promoted the concept of
					intelligence as a single constant.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Binet’s concept of the “IQ test” remains the basis of
					intelligence testing today. Despite its shortcomings, it has generated research
					that has advanced our knowledge of human intelligence.</p></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-256"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ALFRED BINET</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-257"><img alt="" src="images/000221.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Alfred Binet was born in Nice, France, but moved to Paris at a young age after

				the condition of “dissociation”&mdash;the separation of some mental processes from a
				person’s conscious mind, or normal everyday personality. Mild dissociation, in which
				the world seems “dreamlike” and “unreal,” is common, and affects most people at some
				time or other. It is often caused by illnesses, such as flu, or drugs, including
				alcohol, and may lead to a partial or complete loss of memory during and after the
				period of dissociation. In rare cases of what was then described as multiple
				personality disorder, a person appears to have two or more distinct personalities.
				Such extreme examples are now classified as “dissociative identity disorder.”</p><p class="calibre13">The French philosopher and physician Pierre Janet is credited with being the first
				person to study and describe dissociation as a psychiatric condition. In the late
				1880s and early 1890s, he worked at the Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, where he
				treated patients who were suffering from “hysteria.” He published case studies of
				several women who showed extreme symptoms. A patient called “Lucie,” for example,
				would usually be calm, but then suddenly became agitated, crying and looking
				terrified for no apparent reason. She seemed to have three distinct personalities,
				which Janet named “Lucie 1,” “Lucie 2,” and “Lucie 3,” and would change between them
				unexpectedly, especially when hypnotized. Lucie 1 had only “her own” memories, as
				did Lucie 2, but Lucie 3 could remember events relating to all three personalities.
				Significantly, Lucie 3 could recall a traumatic experience, while on vacation at the
				age of seven, when she was terrified by two men who were hiding behind a
				curtain.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-260"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000360.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"These people are persecuted by something, and you must investigate carefully

					if this posture is determined by a subconscious idea, the patient will have the
					emotion alone in his consciousness without knowing why he feels this way.” As
					her terror took hold, Lucie would say, “I’m afraid and I don’t know why.” “The
					unconscious,” said Janet, “is having its dream; it sees the men behind the
					curtains, and puts the body in a posture of terror.” Janet added that he
					believed traumatic events and stress could cause dissociation in anyone with
					that predisposition.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet described the part of the mind that he believed was behind
					uncharacteristic and disturbed behavior as “the subconscious.” But Sigmund Freud
					thought this term was too vague, and instead labeled the source of his patients’
					mental traumas as the “unconscious.” Freud also developed Janet’s ideas, stating
					that dissociation was a universal “defense mechanism.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet’s work was neglected for decades, as the use of hypnotism to investigate
					and treat mental illness was discredited. However, since the late 20th century,

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-100"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="calibre10">By the 1890s, psychology was accepted as a scientific subject
				separate from its philosophical origins. Laboratories and university departments had
				been established in Europe and the US, and a second generation of psychologists was
				emerging.</p><p class="calibre13">In the US, psychologists anxious to put the new discipline on an objective,
				scientific footing reacted against the introspective, philosophical approach taken
				by William James and others. Introspection, they felt, was by definition subjective,
				and theories based on it could be neither proved nor disproved; if psychology was to
				be treated as a science, it would have to be based on observable and measurable
				phenomena. Their solution was to study the manifestation of the workings of the mind
				&mdash;behavior&mdash;under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. As John B. Watson put it,
				psychology is “that division of Natural Science which takes human behavior&mdash; the
				doings and sayings, both learned and unlearned&mdash;as its subject matter.” Early
				“behaviorists,” including Edward Thorndike, Edward Tolman, and Edwin Guthrie,
				designed experiments to observe the behavior of animals in carefully devised
				situations, and from these tests inferred theories about how humans interact with
				their environment, as well as about learning, memory, and conditioning.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-265"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000268.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Conditioning responses</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Behaviorist experiments were influenced by similar experiments devised by
					physiologists studying physical processes, and it was a Russian physiologist,
					Ivan Pavlov, who unwittingly provided a basis for the emergent behaviorist
					psychology. In his now famous study of salivation in dogs, Pavlov described how
					an animal responds to a stimulus in the process of conditioning, and gave
					psychologists the foundation on which to build the central idea of behaviorism.
					The notion of conditioning, often referred to as “stimulus&mdash;response” (S&mdash;R)
					psychology, shaped the form behaviorism was to take.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorist approach concentrated on observing responses to external
					stimuli, ignoring inner mental states and processes, which were thought to be
					impossible to examine scientifically and therefore could not be included in any
					analysis of behavior. The shift from “mind” to “behavior” as a basis for the
					study of psychology was revolutionary, and was even accompanied by a
					“behaviorist manifesto”&mdash;the paper <i class="calibre11">Psychology as the
						Behaviorist Views It</i>, delivered in 1913 by Watson.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, which was leading the field in psychology, behaviorism became the
					dominant approach for the next 40 years. Evolving from the idea of Pavlovian or
					classical conditioning came Watson’s assertion that environmental stimuli alone
					shape behavior; innate or inherited factors are not involved. The next
					generation included the “radical behaviorist” B.F. Skinner, who proposed a
					rethink of the stimulus&mdash;response notion in his theory of “operant conditioning”
					&mdash;which stated that behavior was shaped by consequences, not by a preceding
					stimulus. Although the concept was similar to ideas proposed by William James,
					it radically altered the course of behaviorism, taking into account genetic
					factors and explaining mental states as a result (rather than as a cause) of
					behavior.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The cognitive revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By the mid-20th century, however, psychologists were questioning the
					behaviorist approach. Ethology, the study of animal behavior, showed the
					importance of instinctive as well as learned behavior&mdash;a finding that sat
					uncomfortably with strict ideas of conditioning. A reaction to Skinner’s ideas
					also sparked the “cognitive revolution,” which turned attention once again from
					behavior back to the mind and mental processes. A key figure at this time was
					Edward Tolman, a behaviorist whose theories had not dismissed the importance of
					perception and cognition, due to his interest in German-based Gestalt
					psychology. Advances in neuroscience, explored by another behaviorist, Karl
					Lashley, also played a part in shifting the emphasis from behavior to the brain
					and its workings.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviorism had now run its course, and was superseded by the various branches
					of cognitive psychology. However, its legacy, particularly in establishing a
					scientific methodology for the subject, and in providing models that could be
					used in psychological experimentation, was a lasting one. Behavioral therapy is
					also still in use today, as an essential part of cognitive-behavioral
					therapy.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				its infancy were the result of research by scientists working in other fields. Ivan
				Pavlov, a Russian physiologist, is one of the best known of these early pioneers,
				whose investigations into the secretion of saliva during digestion in dogs led him
				to some unexpected conclusions.</p><p class="calibre13">During the 1890s, Pavlov carried out a series of experiments on dogs, using
				various surgically implanted devices to measure the flow of saliva when these
				animals were being fed. He noted that the dogs salivated not only when they were
				actually eating, but also whenever they could just smell or see some appetizing
				food. The dogs would even salivate, in anticipation of food being produced, when
				they were simply being approached by one of their keepers.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pavlov’s observations led him to investigate the links between various stimuli and
				the responses they elicited. In one experiment, he set off a clicking metronome just
				before offering food to the dogs, repeating this process until the animals always
				associated the sound with a good meal. This “conditioning” eventually resulted in
				the dogs salivating in response to the click of the metronome alone.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;In further experiments, Pavlov replaced the metronome with a bell or buzzer, a
				flashing light, and whistles of different pitches. However, regardless of the nature
				of the stimulus used, the result was the always same: once an association between
				the neutral stimulus (bell, buzzer, or light) and food had been established, the
				dogs would respond to the stimulus by salivating.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-270"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000315.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Facts are the air of science.

					stimulus” (US), because it led to an unlearned, or “unconditioned” response (UR)&mdash;in this case, salivation. The click of the metronome, however, only became a
					stimulus to salivation after its association with food had been learned. Pavlov
					then called this a “conditioned stimulus” (CS). The salivation in response to
					the metronome was also learned, so was a “conditioned response” (CR).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In later experiments, Pavlov showed that conditioned responses could be
					repressed, or “unlearned,” if the conditioned stimulus was given repeatedly
					without being followed by food. He also demonstrated that a conditioned response
					could be mental as well as physical, by carrying out experiments in which
					various stimuli were associated with pain or some form of threat and began to
					elicit a conditioned response of fear or anxiety.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of what is now known as classical or Pavlovian conditioning, as
					well as Pavlov’s experimental method, marked a groundbreaking step in the
					emergence of psychology as a truly scientific, rather than philosophical,
					discipline. Pavlov’s work was to be hugely influential, particularly on US
					behaviorist psychologists, such as John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner.</p></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-273"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">IVAN PAVLOV</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-274"><img alt="" src="images/000262.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Ivan Pavlov, the eldest son of a village priest in Ryazan, Russia, was

				thesis in the US. He was perhaps the first true “behaviorist” psychologist, although
				his research took place long before the term was adopted.</p><p class="calibre13">Scientific psychology was emerging as a fresh field of study in universities when
				Thorndike graduated in the 1890s, and he was attracted by the prospect of applying
				this new science to his interest in education and learning. Thorndike’s original
				intention had been to study learning in humans, but when he was unable to obtain a
				suitable subject for his research, he turned his attention to animals, with the aim
				of examining the processes of intelligence and learning through observation in a
				series of controlled experiments. Thorndike’s results went much further than this,
				however, laying down the foundations of behaviorist psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-277"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000211.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Psychology helps to measure the probability that an aim is attainable."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Edward Thorndike</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Learning environments</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Thorndike’s first studies were of chicks learning to negotiate mazes that he
					designed and built specifically for his experiments. This later became a
					hallmark of behaviorist experimental technique&mdash;the use of a specially created
					environment in which a subject is given specific stimuli or tasks, now known as
					“instrumental conditioning” or “instrumental learning.” As his research
					progressed, Thorndike turned his attention to cats, inventing “puzzle boxes” to
					observe their ability to learn mechanisms for escape.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A hungry cat was locked inside a puzzle box, and by exploring its environment
					would come across various devices, such as a loop of string, or a ring, or a
					button or panel to be pressed, only one of which would be connected to the latch
					that would open the door of the box. In time, the cat would discover the device,
					which would allow it to escape and receive a reward of food. The process was
					repeated and it was noted how long it took for the cat to open the puzzle box
					each time; this indicated how quickly the animal was learning about its
					environment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment was carried out using several different cats, placing each one
					in a series of puzzle boxes that were opened by different devices. What
					Thorndike noticed was that although the cats had all discovered the escape
					mechanism by trial and error in their first attempt, on successive occasions the
					amount of trial and error gradually decreased as the cats learned which actions
					were going to be fruitless and which would lead to a reward.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Law of Effect</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As a result of these experiments Thorndike proposed his Law of Effect, which
					states that a response to a situation that results in a satisfying outcome is
					more likely to occur again in the future; and conversely, that a response to a
					situation that results in an unsatisfying outcome is less likely to occur again.
					This was the first formal statement of an idea that lies behind all behavourist
					psychology, the connection between stimulus and response and its relevance to
					the process of learning and behavior. Thorndike proposed that when a connection
					is made between a stimulus (S) and a response (R), a corresponding neural
					connection is made in the brain. He referred to his brand of S-R learning as
					“connectionism,” asserting that the connections made during learning are
					“stamped in” the circuitry of the brain.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What Thorndike proposed was that it is the outcome of an action that
					determines how strongly or weakly the stimulus-response connection is stamped
					in; in the case of the puzzle boxes, whether pulling a string or pushing a panel
					resulted in escape or frustration. In other words, when particular
					stimulus-response sequences are followed by a satisfying or pleasant state of
					affairs (such as escape or a reward), those responses tend to become “more
					firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more
					likely to recur.” They become “stamped in” as a neural connection. When
					stimulus-response sequences are followed by an annoying or unpleasant state of
					affairs (such as continued imprisonment or punishment), the neural connections
					between the situation and response are weakened, until eventually “profitless
					acts are stamped out.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This focus on the outcome of a stimulus and its response, and the idea that
					the outcome could work back to strengthen the stimulus-response connection, is
					an example of what would later be called a reinforcement theory of learning.
					Reinforcement, and the importance of outcomes, was virtually ignored by
					psychologists in the next generation of behaviorists, such as John B. Watson,
					but the Law of Effect brilliantly anticipated the work of B.F. Skinner and his
					theory of “operant conditioning.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In later research, Thorndike refined the Law of Effect to take into account
					other variables, such as the delay between response and reward, the effect of
					repetition of a task, and how quickly a task was forgotten when it was not
					repeated. From this, he derived his Law of Exercise, which states that
					stimulus-response connections that are repeated are strengthened, while those
					that are not used again are weakened. Moreover, the rate at which connections
					strengthen or weaken can vary. According to Thorndike, “the greater the
					satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the
					bond.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, although Thorndike was studying animal behavior using what were
					to become standard behaviorist methods&mdash;and authoring a book, <i class="calibre11">Animal Intelligence</i> (1911), which was to become a
					classic of early behaviorism&mdash;he considered himself primarily an educational
					psychologist. He had originally intended to examine animal intelligence, not
					behavior. He wanted to show, for example, that animals learned by simple trial
					and error rather than by using a faculty of insight, an idea that was prevalent
					in psychology at the time: “In the first place, most of the books do not give us
					a psychology, but rather a eulogy of animals. They have all been about animal
					intelligence, never about animal stupidity,” he wrote. The fact that his cats in
					puzzle boxes learned gradually, rather than suddenly gaining an insight into how
					to escape, confirmed his theories. The animals were forced to learn by trial and
					error, because they were unable to use reason to work out the link between the
					door and the operating handle.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-280"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000182.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Law of Effect</span>, proposed by

						Intelligence</i>, Thorndike turned his attention to human
					intelligence. In his opinion, the most basic intelligence is characterized by
					simple stimulus and response association, resulting in a neural connection. The
					more intelligent an animal, the more capable it will be of making such
					connections. Therefore, intelligence can be defined in terms of the ability to
					form neural bonds, which is dependent not only on genetic factors, but also on
					experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To find a measurement of human intelligence, Thorndike devised his CAVD
					(Completion, Arithmetic, Vocabulary, and Directions) test. It became the model
					for all modern intelligence tests, and assessed mechanical intelligence
					(understanding of how things work), as well as abstract intelligence (creative
					ability) and social intelligence (interpersonal skills). Thorndike was
					especially interested in how age might affect learning, and also proposed a
					theory of learning that remains at the heart of educational psychology to this
					day, a contribution that is perhaps what Thorndike would have wished more than
					anything else to be remembered for. However, it is for his enormous influence on
					the behaviorist movement that Thorndike is most often lauded.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"The intellect, character, and skill possessed by any man are the product

				concluded that the human mind could not be adequately studied through introspective
				methods, and were advocating a switch to the study of the mind through the evidence
				of behavior in controlled laboratory experiments.</p><p class="calibre13">John Watson was not the first advocate of this thoroughgoing behaviorist approach,
				but he was certainly the most conspicuous. In a career cut short by his marital
				infidelity, he became one of the most influential and controversial psychologists of
				the 20th century. Through his work on the stimulus&mdash;response learning theory that had
				been pioneered by Thorndike, he became regarded as the “founding father” of
				behaviorism, and he did much to popularize the use of the term. His 1913 lecture,
					<i class="calibre11">Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It</i>, put
				forward the revolutionary idea that “a truly scientific psychology would abandon
				talk of mental states… and instead focus on prediction and control of behavior.”
				This lecture became known to later psychologists as the “behaviorist manifesto.”
				Before Watson’s research at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, the
				majority of experiments on behavior had concentrated on animal behavior, with the
				results extrapolated to human behavior. Watson himself studied rats and monkeys for
				his doctorate but (perhaps influenced by his experience working with the military
				during World War I) was keen to conduct experiments using human subjects. He wanted
				to study the stimulus&mdash;response model of classical conditioning and how it applied to
				the prediction and control of human behavior. He believed that people have three
				fundamental emotions&mdash;fear, rage, and love&mdash;and he wanted to find out whether a person
				could be conditioned into feeling these in response to a stimulus.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-287"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000082.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective experimental

					experiments involving “Albert B,” a nine-month-old baby chosen from a local
					children’s hospital. The tests were designed to see whether it is possible to
					teach an infant to fear an animal by repeatedly presenting it at the same time
					as a loud, frightening noise. Watson also wanted to find out whether such a fear
					would transfer to other animals or objects; and how long this fear would
					persist. Today, his methods would be considered unethical and even cruel, but at
					the time they were seen as a logical and natural progression from previous
					animal studies.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the now famous “Little Albert experiment,” Watson placed the healthy but
					“on the whole stolid and unemotional” baby Albert on a mattress and then
					observed his reactions when introduced to a dog, a white rat, a rabbit, a
					monkey, and some inanimate objects, including human masks and burning paper.
					Albert showed no fear of any of these animals or objects and even reached out to
					touch them. In this way, Watson established a baseline from which he could
					measure any change in the child’s behavior toward the objects.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate occasion, while Albert was sitting on the mattress, Watson
					struck a metal bar with a hammer to make a sudden loud noise; unsurprisingly,
					Albert became frightened and distressed, bursting into tears. Watson now had an
					unconditioned stimulus (the loud noise) that he knew elicited a response of fear
					in the child. By pairing this with the sight of the rat, he hypothesized that he
					would be able to condition little Albert to become afraid of the animal.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When Albert was just over 11 months old, Watson carried out the experiment.
					The white rat was placed on the mattress with Albert, then Watson hit the hammer
					on the steel bar when the child touched the rat. The child burst into tears.
					This procedure was repeated seven times over two sessions, one week apart, after
					which Albert became distressed as soon as the rat was brought into the room,
					even when it was not accompanied by the noise.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By repeatedly pairing the rat with the loud noise, Watson was applying the
					same kind of classical conditioning as Pavlov had in his experiments with dogs.
					The child’s natural response to the noise&mdash;fear and distress&mdash;had now become
					associated with the rat. The child had become conditioned to respond to the rat
					with fear. In terms of classical conditioning, the rat was initially a neutral
					stimulus eliciting no particular response; the loud noise was an “unconditioned
					stimulus” (US) that elicited an “unconditioned response” (UR) of fear. After
					conditioning, the rat had become a “conditioned stimulus” (CS), eliciting the
					“conditioned response” (CR) of fear.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this conditioning seemed to go deeper than simply a fear of the white
					rat, and appeared to be far from temporary. In order to test whether Albert’s
					fear had “generalized,” or spread to other, similar objects, he was reintroduced
					to white furry things&mdash;including a rabbit, a dog, and a sheepskin coat&mdash;five days
					after the original conditioning. Albert showed the same distressed and fearful
					response to these as to the rat.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In these experiments, Watson demonstrated that human emotions are susceptible
					to classical conditioning. This was a new finding, because previous
					stimulus&mdash;response experiments had focused on testing the learning of physical
					behaviors. Watson had discovered that not only can human behavior be predicted&mdash;given certain stimuli and conditions&mdash;it can also be controlled and modified. A
					further check of Albert’s reactions to the rat, rabbit, and dog one month later
					suggested that the effects of this conditioning were long-lasting, but this
					could not be proven as Albert was soon after removed from the hospital by his
					mother. It has been suggested that this was a sign of the mother’s distress, but
					according to Watson and Rayner’s own account, it occurred on a prearranged
					date.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"I shall never be satisfied until I have a laboratory in which I can bring

					experiments when he was forced to resign his professorship amid the scandal of
					his affair with his researcher, Rosalie Rayner. Despite the incompleteness of
					his research, Watson felt vindicated in his belief in behaviorism, and more
					particularly the application of classical stimulus&mdash;response conditioning to
					humans. Perhaps because of his forced ejection from the academic world (into
					advertising, where he was hugely successful) he developed a tendency to
					overstate the scope of his findings, and with a natural gift for self-publicity
					continued to publish books on the subject of psychology.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not content, for example, to claim that it is possible to condition emotional
					responses, he boasted that on the same principle it would be possible to control
					or modify almost any aspect of human behavior, no matter how complex. Just as
					Little Albert had been conditioned to fear certain white furry objects against
					his natural inclination, Watson believed that “Anyone, regardless of their
					nature, can be trained to be anything.” He even boasted in his 1924 book
						<i class="calibre11">Behaviorism</i>: “Give me a dozen healthy
					infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I’ll
					guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of
					specialist I might select&mdash;doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even
					beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies,
					abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.” In the “nature versus nurture”
					debate, Watson was firmly on the side of nurture.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-290"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000391.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Watson saw the child</span> as the ultimate

					behaviorism by turning his attention to the business of childcare. It was in
					this that his views proved to be most publicly influential, and eventually most
					controversial. Predictably, he advocated a strictly behaviorist approach to
					bringing up children, and throughout the 1920s and 30s his many books on
					childcare became immensely popular. In retrospect, it is easy to see that his
					approach, based on extreme emotional detachment, was at best misguided and
					potentially damaging, but his methods were adopted by millions of parents,
					including Watson and Rosalie Rayner themselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The child, Watson believed, is shaped by its environment, and that environment
					is controlled by the parents. In essence, he saw child-raising as an objective
					exercise in behavior modification, especially of the emotions of fear, rage, and
					love. Perhaps understandably, given his own unhappy childhood, he dismissed
					affection as sentimental, leading to over-dependence of the child on the parent.
					But he also advised against the opposite emotional extreme and was an opponent
					of physical punishment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Watson’s questionable application of stimulus&mdash;response conditioning to
					childcare eventually drew criticism. Later generations viewed the approach as
					manipulative and uncaring, with an emphasis on efficiency and results rather
					than on the wellbeing of the child. The long-term damage to children brought up
					according to Watson’s behaviorist model became apparent only gradually, but was
					significant. The popularity of his books as childcare “bibles” meant that a
					whole generation was affected by what can now be seen as a dysfunctional
					upbringing. Even Watson’s own family suffered: Rosalie eventually saw the flaws
					in her husband’s child-rearing theories and wrote a critical article for
						<i class="calibre11">Parents’ Magazine</i> entitled “I Am the
					Mother of a Behaviorist’s Sons,” and Watson’s granddaughter, the actor Mariette
					Hartley, gave an account of her disturbed family background in her
					autobiographical book <i class="calibre11">Breaking the
					Silence</i>.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative approaches to childcare soon appeared, even among committed
					behaviorists. While accepting the basic principle of conditioning established by
					Watson (despite the dubious ethics of the Little Albert experiment), and using
					that as a starting point for his own “radical behaviorism,” the psychologist
					B.F. Skinner was to apply behaviorism to the business of childcare in a much
					more benign (if eccentric) manner.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Watsonism has become gospel and catechism in the nurseries and drawing

				psychology, Edward Tolman took a very different approach from that of Thorndike and
				Watson. He agreed with the basic methodology of behaviorism&mdash;that psychology could
				only be studied by objective, scientific experiments&mdash;but was also interested in
				ideas about mental processes, including perception, cognition, and motivation, which
				he had encountered while studying Gestalt psychology in Germany. By bridging these
				two previously separate approaches, he developed a new theory about the role of
				conditioning, and created what he called “purposive behaviorism,” now called
				cognitive behaviorism. Tolman questioned the basic premise of conditioned learning
				(that behavior was learned simply by an automatic response to a stimulus). He
				believed that animals could learn about the world around them without the
				reinforcement of a reward, and later use that knowledge in decision-making.</p><p class="calibre13">He designed a series of experiments using rats in mazes to examine the role of
				reinforcement in learning. Comparing a group of rats that were rewarded with food
				daily for successfully negotiating the maze, with another group who were only
				rewarded after six days, and a third group rewarded after two days, Tolman’s ideas
				were confirmed. The second and third groups made fewer errors when running the maze
				the day after they had been rewarded with food, demonstrating that they already
				“knew” their way around the maze, having learned it prior to receiving rewards. Once
				rewards were on offer, they were able to use the “cognitive map” they had built in
				order to negotiate the maze faster.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-297"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000303.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"There is more than one kind of learning."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Edward Tolman</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Latent learning</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Tolman referred to the rats’ initial learning period, where there was no

					humans, go about their daily lives, they build up a cognitive map of the world
					around them&mdash;the “God-given maze”&mdash;which they can apply to locate specific goals.
					He gave the example of how we learn the locations of various landmarks on our
					daily journeys, but only realize what we have learned when we need to find
					somewhere along the route. Further experiments showed that the rats learned a
					sense of location rather than merely the turns required to reach a particular
					place.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i class="calibre11">Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men</i>,

				attention to psychology, the stimulus&mdash;response model of learning formed the basis of
				almost all behaviorist theories. Derived from Ivan Pavlov’s idea of “classical
				conditioning,” it claimed that repeatedly exposing subjects to particular stimuli
				combinations (such as being given food and ringing a bell) could eventually provoke
				conditioned responses (such as salivating when a bell is rung).</p><p class="calibre13">Although Guthrie was a strict behaviorist, he did not agree that conditioning
				needed reinforcement to be successful. He believed that a full association between a
				specific stimulus and response is made in their very first pairing. Guthrie’s theory
				of one-trial learning was based on a study in which he observed cats trapped in
				“puzzle boxes.” The cats, once they had discovered the mechanism for escape, made
				the association between escape and their action, which they would then repeat on
				subsequent occasions. In the same way, Guthrie said, once a rat has discovered a
				source of food, it knows where to come when it is hungry.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Guthrie expanded his idea into a theory of “contiguity,” stating that “a
				combination of stimuli, which has accompanied a movement, will on its reoccurrence
				tend to be followed by that movement.” A movement, not behavior, is learned from
				stimulus&mdash;response association. Related movements combine to form an act; repetition
				does not reinforce the association but leads to the formation of acts, which combine
				to form behavior.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"We expect one quarrel to change attitudes."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Edwin Guthrie</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-32" class="calibre3">Ivan Pavlov</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-30" class="calibre3">Edward Thorndike</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-34" class="calibre3">Edward Tolman</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-35" class="calibre3">B.F.

				behavior that did not fit current theory: “Our behavior researches in the past have
				been in the wrong direction, because, instead of finding how we could build nature
				into the animal, we have tried to find nature in the animal.” Kuo’s most well-known
				experiments involved rearing kittens&mdash;some raised from birth in cages with rats,
				others introduced to rats at later stages. He found that “if a kitten was raised in
				the same cage with a rat since it was very young, it, when grown-up, became tolerant
				of rats: not only would it never attack a rat, but it adopted the rat as its ‘mate’,
				played with it, and even became attached to it.” Kuo’s work was cut short by
				political events in China, which forced him to flee first to the US, then Hong Kong.
				His ideas only became known in the West as behaviorism was beginning to wane and
				cognitive psychology was in the ascendant. However, his theory of ongoing
				development without innate mechanisms was influential as a counter to the
				instinct-based psychology of Konrad Lorenz.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-306"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000243.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Harmonious relationships</span>, Kuo proved, can

				house in Altenberg, Austria. He noticed that the young birds rapidly made a bond
				with their mother after hatching, but could also form the same attachment to a
				foster parent if the mother was absent. This phenomenon, which Lorenz called

				imprinting his Wellington boots) as a foster parent.</p><p class="calibre13">What distinguishes imprinting from learning, Lorenz discovered, is that it happens

				the most widely known and influential behaviorist psychologist. He was not, however,
				a pioneer in the field, but developed the ideas of his predecessors, such as Ivan
				Pavlov and John B. Watson, by subjecting theories of behaviorism to rigorous
				experimental scrutiny in order to arrive at his controversial stance of “radical
				behaviorism.”</p><p class="calibre13">Skinner proved to be an ideal advocate of behaviorism. Not only were his arguments
				based on the results of scrupulous scientific methodology (so they could be proved),
				but his experiments tended to involve the use of novel contraptions that the general
				public found fascinating. Skinner was an inveterate “gadget man” and a provocative
				self-publicist. But behind the showman image was a serious scientist, whose work
				helped to finally sever psychology from its introspective philosophical roots and
				establish it as a scientific discipline in its own right.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinner had once contemplated a career as an author, but he had little time for
				the philosophical theorizing of many of the early psychologists. Works by Pavlov and
				Watson were his main influence; he saw psychology as following in the scientific
				tradition, and anything that could not been seen, measured, and repeated in a
				rigorously controlled experiment was of no interest to him.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Processes purely of the mind, therefore, were outside Skinner’s interest and
				scope. In fact, he reached the conclusion that they must be utterly subjective, and
				did not exist at all separately from the body. In Skinner’s opinion, the way to
				carry out psychological research was through observable behavior, rather than
				through unobservable thoughts.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a strict behaviorist from the outset of his career, Skinner differed from
				earlier behaviorists in his interpretation of conditioning&mdash;in particular, the
				principle of “classical conditioning” as described by Pavlov. While not disagreeing
				that a conditioned response could be elicited by repeated training, Skinner felt
				that this was something of a special case, involving the deliberate, artificial
				introduction of a conditioning stimulus.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Skinner, it seemed that the consequences of an action were more important in
				shaping behavior than any stimulus that had preceded or coincided with it. He
				concluded from his experiments that behavior is primarily learned from the results
				of actions. As with so many great insights, this may appear to be self-evident, but
				it marked a major turning point in behaviorist psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-315"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000270.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The objection to inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they are

					the inside. Every time the rat pressed this bar, it was presented with a food
					pellet. The rate of bar-pressing was automatically recorded. Initially, the rat
					might press the bar accidentally, or simply out of curiosity, and as a
					consequence receive some food. Over time, the rat learned that food appeared
					whenever the bar was pressed, and began to press it purposefully in order to be
					fed. Comparing results from rats given the “positive reinforcement” of food for
					their bar-pressing behavior with those that were not, or were presented with
					food at different rates, it became clear that when food appeared as a
					consequence of the rat’s actions, this influenced its future behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinner concluded that animals are conditioned by the responses they receive
					from their actions and environment. As the rats explored the world around them,
					some of their actions had a positive consequence (Skinner was careful to avoid
					the word “reward” with its connotations of being given for “good” behavior),
					which in turn encouraged them to repeat that behavior. In Skinner’s terms, an
					“organism” operates on its environment, and encounters a stimulus (a food
					pellet), which reinforces its operant behavior (pressing on the bar). In order
					to distinguish this from classical conditioning, he coined the term “operant
					conditioning;” the major distinction being that operant conditioning depends not
					on a preceding stimulus, but on what follows as a consequence of a particular
					type of behavior. It is also different in that it represents a two-way process,
					in which an action, or behavior, is operating on the environment just as much as
					the environment is shaping that behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his experiments, Skinner began to run short of food pellets,
					forcing him to reschedule the rate at which they were being given to the rats.
					Some rats now received a food pellet only after they had pressed the bar a
					number of times repeatedly, either at fixed intervals or randomly. The results
					of this variation reinforced Skinner’s original findings, but they also led to a
					further discovery: that while a reinforcing stimulus led to a greater
					probability of a behavior occurring, if the reinforcing stimulus was then
					stopped, there was a decrease in the likelihood of that behavior
					occurring.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinner continued making his experiments ever more varied and sophisticated,
					including changes of schedule to establish whether the rats could distinguish
					and respond to differences in the rate of delivery of food pellets. As he
					suspected, the rats adapted very quickly to the new schedules.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The ideal of behaviorism is to eliminate coercion, to apply controls by

					electric grid, which would give the rats an unpleasant shock whenever they were
					activated. This allowed for the investigation of the effect of negative
					reinforcement on behavior. Again, just as Skinner avoided the word “reward,” he
					was careful not to describe the electric shock as “punishment,” a distinction
					that became increasingly important as he examined the implications of his
					research.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative reinforcement was not a new concept in psychology. As early as 1890,
					William James had written in <i class="calibre11">Principles of
						Psychology</i>: “Animals, for example, awaken in a child the opposite
					impulses of fearing and fondling. But if a child, in his first attempts to pat a
					dog, gets snapped at or bitten, so that the impulse of fear is strongly aroused,
					it may be that for years to come no dog will excite in him the impulse to fondle
					again.” Skinner was to provide the experimental evidence for this idea.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-319"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000063.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Winning at gambling</span> often boosts the

							behavior.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-320" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Positive reinforcement</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As expected, Skinner found that whenever a behavior resulted in the negative
					consequence of an electric shock, there was a decrease in that behavior. He went
					on to redesign the Skinner boxes used in the experiment, so that the rats inside
					were able to switch off the electrified grid by pressing a bar, which provided a
					form of positive reinforcement arising from the removal of a negative stimulus.
					The results that followed confirmed Skinner’s theory&mdash;if a behavior leads to the
					removal of a negative stimulus, that behavior increases.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the results also revealed an interesting distinction between behavior
					learned by positive reinforcement and behavior elicited by negative stimuli. The
					rats responded better and more quickly to the positive stimuli (as well as the
					removal of negative stimuli), than when their behavior resulted in a negative
					response. While still careful to avoid the notions of “reward” and “punishment,”
					Skinner concluded that behavior was shaped much more efficiently by a program of
					positive reinforcement. In fact, he came to believe that negative reinforcement
					could even be counter-productive, with the subject continuing to seek positive
					responses for a specific behavior, despite this leading to a negative response
					in the majority of cases.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This has implications in various areas of human behavior too; for example, in
					the use of disciplinary measures to teach children. If a boy is continually
					being punished for something he finds enjoyable, such as picking his nose, he is
					likely to avoid doing so when adults are around. The child may modify his
					behavior, but only so far as it enables him to avoid punishment. Skinner himself
					believed that ultimately all forms of punishment were unsuitable for controlling
					children’s behavior.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-321"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000041.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Positive reinforcement</span> can stimulate

					Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection&mdash;in essence, that only organisms
					suited by their genetic make-up to a particular environment will survive to
					reproduce, ensuring the “success” of their species. The likelihood of a rat
					behaving in a way that will result in a reinforcing stimulus, triggering the
					process of operant conditioning, is dependent on the level of its curiosity and
					intelligence, both of which are determined by genetic make-up. It was this
					combination of predisposition and conditioning that led Skinner to conclude that
					“a person’s behavior is controlled by his genetic and environmental histories”
					&mdash;an idea that he explored further in his article <i class="calibre11">The
						Selection by Consequences</i>, written for the journal <i class="calibre11">Science</i> in 1981.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1936, Skinner took up a post at the University of Minnesota, where he
					continued to refine his experimental research in operant conditioning and to
					explore practical applications for his ideas, this time using pigeons instead of
					rats. With the pigeons, Skinner found that he was able to devise more subtle
					experiments. Using what he described as a “method of successive approximations”,
					he could elicit and investigate more complex patterns of behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinner gave the pigeons positive reinforcement for any behavior that was
					similar to that he was trying to elicit. For example, if he was trying to train
					a pigeon to fly in a circle clockwise, food would be given for any movement the
					pigeon made to the right, however small. Once this behavior had been
					established, the food was only given for longer flights to the right, and the
					process was repeated until the pigeon had to fly a full circle in order to
					receive some food.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-323"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000014.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Skinner’s pigeon</span> experiments proved
							that the positive reinforcement of being fed on the achievement of a
							task helped to speed up and reinforce the learning of new behavior
							patterns.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-324" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Teaching program</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Skinner’s research led him to question teaching methods used in schools. In
					the 1950s, when his own children were involved in formal education, students
					were often given long tasks that involved several stages, and usually had to
					wait until the teacher had graded work carried out over the entire project
					before finding out how well they had done. This approach ran contrary to
					Skinner’s findings about the process of learning and, in his opinion, was
					holding back progress. In response, Skinner developed a teaching program that
					gave incremental feedback at every stage of a project&mdash;a process that was later
					incorporated into a number of educational systems. He also invented a “teaching
					machine” that gave a student encouraging feedback for correct answers given at
					every stage of a long series of test questions, rather than just at the end.
					Although it only achieved limited approval at the time, the principles embodied
					in Skinner’s teaching machine resurfaced decades later in self-education
					computer programs.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be said that many of Skinner’s inventions were misunderstood at the
					time, and gained him a reputation as an eccentric. His “baby tender,” for
					example, was designed as a crib alternative to keep his infant daughter in a
					controlled, warm, and draft-free environment. However, the public confused it
					with a Skinner box, and it was dubbed the “heir conditioner” by the press, amid
					rumors that Skinner was experimenting on his own children. Nevertheless, the
					baby tender attracted publicity, and Skinner was never shy of the
					limelight.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-325"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000399.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Praise or encouragement</span> given at
							frequent intervals during the progress of a piece of work, rather than

							children learn.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">War effort</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Yet another famous experiment called “Project Pigeon” was met with skepticism
					and some derision. This practical application of Skinner’s work with pigeons was
					intended as a serious contribution to the war effort in 1944. Missile guidance
					systems were yet to be invented, so Skinner devised a nose cone that could be
					attached to a bomb and steered by three pigeons placed inside it. The birds had
					been trained, using operant conditioning, to peck at an image of the bomb’s
					target, which was projected into the nose cone via a lens at the front. This
					pecking controlled the flight-path of the missile. The National Defense Research
					Committee helped fund the project, but it was never used in combat, because it
					was considered too eccentric and impractical. The suspicion was that Skinner,
					with his passion for gadgets, was more interested in the invention than in its
					application. When asked if he thought it right to involve animals in warfare, he
					replied that he thought it was wrong to involve humans.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In later life as an academic at Harvard, Skinner also expanded on the
					implications of his findings in numerous articles and books. <i class="calibre11">Walden Two</i> (1948) describes a utopian society based
					on behavior learned with operant conditioning. The book’s vision of social
					control achieved by positive reinforcement caused controversy, and despite its
					benign intent was criticized by many as totalitarian. This was not a surprising
					reaction, given the political climate in the aftermath of World War II.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Radical behaviorism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Skinner remained true to his behaviorist approach, coining the term “radical
					behaviorism” for the branch of psychology he espoused. Although he did not deny
					the existence of thought processes and mental states, he believed that
					psychology should be concerned solely with the study of physical responses to
					prevailing conditions or situations.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book, <i class="calibre11">Beyond Freedom and Dignity</i>,
					Skinner took the concept of shaping behavior even further, resurrecting the
					philosophical debate between free will and determinism. For the radical
					behaviorist Skinner, free will is an illusion; selection by consequences
					controls all of our behavior, and hence our lives. Attempts to escape this
					notion are doomed to failure and chaos. As he put it: “When Milton’s Satan falls
					from heaven, he ends in hell. And what does he say to reassure himself? ‘Here,
					at least, we shall be free.’ And that, I think, is the fate of the old-fashioned
					liberal. He’s going to be free, but he’s going to find himself in hell.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Views such as these gained him notoriety, and prompted some of his fiercest
					critics. In particular, the application of his behaviorist ideas to the learning
					of language in <i class="calibre11">Verbal Behavior</i> in 1957
					received a scathing review from Noam Chomsky, which is often credited as
					launching the movement known as cognitive psychology.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some criticism of Skinner’s work, however, has been based on misunderstanding
					the principles of operant conditioning. Radical behaviorism has often been
					linked erroneously to the European philosophical movement of logical positivism,
					which holds the view that statements or ideas are only meaningful if they can be
					verified by actual experience. But it has in fact much more in common with
					American pragmatism, which measures the importance or value of actions according
					to their consequences. It has also been misinterpreted as presenting all living
					beings as the passive subjects of conditioning, whereas to Skinner operant
					conditioning was a two-way process, in which an organism operates on its
					environment and that environment responds, with the consequence often shaping
					future behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1960s, the focus in psychology swung away from the study of behavior to
					the study of mental processes, and for a time Skinner’s ideas were discredited,
					or at least ignored. A reappraisal of behaviorism soon followed, however, and
					his work found an appreciative audience in many areas of applied psychology,
					especially among educationalists and clinical psychologists&mdash;the approach of
					cognitive behavioral therapy owes much to his ideas.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"Skinner has an unbounded love for the idea that there are no individuals,

					animals and children new behavioral patterns through stimulus-response training,
					or classical conditioning. They had been able to make a previously unfelt
					emotional response to an object or event become automatic. Wolpe reasoned that
					if behavior could be learned in this way, it could also be unlearned, and he
					proposed to find a method of using this to help disturbed war veterans.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolpe had discovered that a human being is not capable of experiencing two
					contradictory states of emotion at the same time. It is not possible, for
					example, to feel great anxiety of any kind, when you are feeling very relaxed.
					This inspired him to teach his patients deep-muscle relaxation techniques, which
					he went on to pair with simultaneous exposure to some form of anxiety-inducing
					stimuli&mdash;a technique that became known as reciprocal inhibition.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolpe’s patients were asked to imagine the thing or event that they found
					disturbing. If they started to become anxious, they would be encouraged to “stop
					imagining the scene and relax.” This approach gradually blocked out a patient’s
					feelings of fear. Just as the patient had previously been conditioned by his
					experiences to become anxious when recalling certain particularly harrowing
					memories, he now became conditioned&mdash;within a very short time&mdash;to block out his
					anxiety response, by focusing on the directly contradictory feeling of being
					totally relaxed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolpe’s reciprocal inhibition succeeded in reconditioning the brain by
					focusing solely on symptoms and current behavior, without any analysis of a
					patient’s past. It was also effective and brought fast results, and led to many
					important new techniques in the field of behavioral therapy. Wolpe himself used
					it to develop a systematic desensitization program to cure phobias, such as fear

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-149"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="calibre10">At the turn of the 20th century, behaviorism was becoming the
				dominant approach to psychology in the US; psychologists in Europe, however, were
				taking a different direction. This was largely due to the work of Sigmund Freud,
				whose theories focused on psychopathology and treatment rather than the study of
				mental processes and behavior. Unlike behaviorism, his ideas were based on
				observation and case histories rather than experimental evidence.</p><p class="calibre13">Freud had worked with the French neurologist Jean Martin Charcot, and was much
				influenced by the latter’s use of hypnosis for the treatment of hysteria. From his
				time with Charcot, Freud realized the importance of the unconscious, an area of
				nonconscious thought that he felt was key to our behavior. Freud believed that
				accessing the unconscious by talking to his patients would bring painful, hidden
				memories into conscious awareness where the patient could make sense of them, and so
				gain relief from their symptoms.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-338"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000351.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-339" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">New psychotherapies</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Freud’s ideas spread across Europe and the US. He attracted a circle at his
					Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, which included Alfred Adler and Carl Jung.
					However, both these men came to disagree with elements of Freud’s theories,
					going on to develop their own distinct psychodynamic approaches based on Freud’s
					groundwork. Well-known therapists Melanie Klein and Karen Horney, and even
					Freud’s daughter Anna, also broke away from Freud. Despite these differences of
					opinion, however, Freud’s basic ideas were modified rather than rejected by the
					next generation of psychoanalysts, and subsequent theories place the emphasis on
					different areas. Erik Erikson, for example, took a more social and developmental
					approach, while Jung was to formulate the idea of a collective
					unconscious.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first half of the 20th century, psychoanalysis in its various forms
					remained the main alternative to behaviorism, and it faced no serious challenges
					until after World War II. In the 1950s, Freudian psychotherapy was still
					practiced by therapists, especially in France by Jacques Lacan and his
					followers, but new therapies appeared that sought to bring about genuine change
					in patients’ lives. The somewhat eclectic Gestalt therapy was developed by Fritz
					and Laura Perls and Paul Goodman, while existential philosophy inspired
					psychologists such as Viktor Frankl and Erich Fromm, who gave therapy a more
					sociopolitical agenda.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, a group of psychologists keen to explore a more humanistic
					approach held a series of meetings in the US in the late 1950s, setting out a
					framework for an association known as “the third force,” which was dedicated to
					exploring themes such as self-actualization, creativity, and personal freedom.
					Its founders&mdash;including Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May&mdash;stressed the
					importance of mental health as much as the treatment of mental disorders.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most significant threat to psychoanalysis at this time came from
					cognitive psychology, which criticized psychoanalysis for its lack of objective
					evidence&mdash;either for its theories or its efficacy as treatment. In contrast,
					cognitive psychology provided scientifically proven theories and, later,
					clinically effective therapeutic practices.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-340" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cognitive psychotherapy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Cognitive psychologists dismissed psychoanalysis as unscientific and its
					theories as unprovable. One of the key concepts of Freudian analysis&mdash;repressed

					memory was shown to be unstable by Elizabeth Loftus. Cognitive psychology
					instead offered evidence-based psychotherapies such as Albert Ellis’s Rational
					Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Aaron Beck’s cognitive therapy. Freud’s
					emphasis on childhood development and personal history inspired much
					developmental and social psychology, and in the late 20th century
					psychotherapists such as Guy Corneau, Virginia Satir, and Donald Winnicott
					turned their attention to the family environment; while others, including
					Timothy Leary and Dorothy Rowe, focused on social pressures.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Freud’s original ideas have often been questioned over the years, the

				It seems to contain all of our experience of reality, although it appears to be
				beyond our awareness or control. It is the place where we retain all our memories,
				thoughts, and feelings. The notion fascinated Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist
				Sigmund Freud, who wanted to find out if it was possible to explain things that
				seemed to lie beyond the confines of psychology at the time. Those who had begun to
				examine the unconscious feared that it might be filled with psychic activity that
				was too powerful, too frightening, or too incomprehensible for our conscious mind to
				be able to incorporate. Freud’s work on the subject was pioneering. He described the
				structure of the mind as formed of the conscious, the unconscious, and the
				preconscious, and he popularized the idea of the unconscious, introducing the notion
				that it is the part of the mind that defines and explains the workings behind our
				ability to think and experience.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-343"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000306.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-344" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Hypnosis and hysteria</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Freud’s introduction to the world of the unconscious came in 1885 when he came
					across the work of the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who seemed to be
					successfully treating patients for symptoms of mental illness using hypnosis.
					Charcot’s view was that hysteria was a neurological disorder caused by
					abnormalities of the nervous system, and this idea provided important new
					possibilities for treatments. Freud returned to Vienna, eager to use this new
					knowledge, but struggled to find a workable technique.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;He then encountered Joseph Breuer, a well-respected physician, who had found
					that he could greatly reduce the severity of one of his patient’s symptoms of
					mental illness simply by asking her to describe her fantasies and
					hallucinations. Breuer began using hypnosis to facilitate her access to memories
					of a traumatic event, and after twice-weekly hypnosis sessions all her symptoms
					had been alleviated. Breuer concluded that her symptoms had been the result of
					disturbing memories buried in her unconscious mind, and that voicing the
					thoughts brought them to consciousness, allowing the symptoms to disappear. This
					is the case of Anna O, and is the first instance of intensive psychotherapy as a
					treatment for mental illness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Breuer became Freud’s friend and colleague, and together the two developed and
					popularized a method of psychological treatment based on the idea that many
					forms of mental illness (irrational fears, anxiety, hysteria, imagined paralyses
					and pains, and certain types of paranoia) were the results of traumatic
					experiences that had occurred in the patient’s past and were now hidden away
					from consciousness. Through Freud and Breuer’s technique, outlined in the
					jointly published <i class="calibre11">Studies in Hysteria</i> (1895),
					they claimed to have found a way to release the repressed memory from the
					unconscious, allowing the patient to consciously recall the memory and confront
					the experience, both emotionally and intellectually. The process set free the
					trapped emotion, and the symptoms disappeared. Breuer disagreed with what he
					felt was Freud’s eventual overemphasis on the sexual origins and content of
					neuroses (problems caused by psychological conflicts), and the two parted; Freud
					to continue developing the ideas and techniques of psychoanalysis.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-345"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000276.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Anna O</span>, actually Bertha Pappenheim, was

					believe that what we think, feel, remember, and experience make up the entirety
					of the human mind. But Freud says that the active state of consciousness&mdash;that
					is, the operational mind of which we are directly aware in our everyday
					experience&mdash;is just a fraction of the total psychological forces at work in our
					psychical reality. The conscious exists at the superficial level, to which we
					have easy and immediate access. Beneath the conscious lies the powerful
					dimensions of the unconscious, the warehouse from which our active cognitive
					state and behavior are dictated. The conscious is effectively the puppet in the
					hands of the unconscious. The conscious mind is merely the surface of a complex
					psychic realm.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the unconscious is all-encompassing, Freud says, it contains within it
					the smaller spheres of the conscious and an area called the “preconscious.”
					Everything that is conscious&mdash;that we actively know&mdash;has at one time been
					unconscious before rising to consciousness. However, not everything becomes
					consciously known; much of what is unconscious remains there. Memories that are
					not in our everyday working memory, but which have not been repressed, reside in
					a part of the conscious mind that Freud called the preconscious. We are able to
					bring these memories into conscious awareness at any time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The unconscious acts as a receptacle for ideas or memories that are too
					powerful, too painful, or otherwise too much for the conscious mind to process.
					Freud believed that when certain ideas or memories (and their associated
					emotions) threaten to overwhelm the psyche, they are split apart from a memory
					that can be accessed by the conscious mind, and stored in the unconscious
					instead.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"The mind is like an iceberg; it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above
						water."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sigmund Freud</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-347"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000255.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Our psyche</span>, according to Freud,
							resembles an iceberg, with the area of primitive drives, the id, lying
							hidden in the unconscious. The ego deals with conscious thoughts and
							regulates both the id and the superego&mdash;our critical, judging
							voice.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-348" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Dynamic thought</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Freud was also influenced by the physiologist Ernst Brücke, who was one of the
					founders of the 19th-century’s “new physiology,” which looked for mechanistic
					explanations for all organic phenomena. Brücke claimed that like every other
					living organism, the human being is essentially an energy system, and so must
					abide by the Principle of the Conservation of Energy. This law states that the
					total amount of energy in a system stays constant over time; it cannot be
					destroyed, only moved or transformed. Freud applied this thinking to mental
					processes, resulting in the idea of “psychic energy.” This energy, he said, can
					undergo modification, transmission, and conversion, but cannot be destroyed. So
					if we have a thought that the conscious mind finds unacceptable, the mind
					redirects it away from conscious thought into the unconscious, in a process
					Freud called “repression.” We may repress the memory of a childhood trauma (such
					as abuse or witnessing an accident), a desire we have judged as unacceptable
					(perhaps for your best friend’s partner), or ideas that otherwise threaten our
					wellbeing or way of life.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Like the physical, the psychical is not necessarily in reality what it
						appears to be."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sigmund Freud</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-349" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Motivating drives</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The unconscious is also the place where our instinctual biological drives
					reside. The drives govern our behavior, directing us toward choices that promise
					to satisfy our basic needs. The drives ensure our survival: the need for food
					and water; the desire for sex to ensure the continuation of our species; and the
					necessity to find warmth, shelter, and companionship. But Freud claims the
					unconscious also holds a contrasting drive, the death drive, which is present
					from birth. This drive is self-destructive and impels us forward, though as we
					do so we are moving closer to our death.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his later works, Freud moved away from the idea that the mind was
					structured by the conscious, unconscious, and preconscious to propose a new
					controlling structure: the id, ego, and superego. The id (formed of primitive
					impulses) obeys the Pleasure Principle, which says that every wishful impulse
					must be immediately gratified: it wants everything now. However, another part of
					the mental structure, the ego, recognizes the Reality Principle, which says we
					can’t have everything we desire, but must take account of the world we live in.
					The ego negotiates with the id, trying to find reasonable ways to help it get
					what it wants, without resulting in damage or other terrible consequences. The
					ego itself is controlled by the superego&mdash;the internalized voice of parents and
					society’s moral codes. The superego is a judging force, and the source of our
					conscience, guilt, and shame.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Freud proposes, the unconscious holds a vast amount of conflicting
					forces. In addition to the drives of the life and death forces, it encompasses
					the intensity of repressed memories and emotions, as well as the contradictions
					inherent in our views of conscious reality alongside our repressed reality.
					According to Freud, the conflict that arises from these contrasting forces is
					the psychological conflict that underlies human suffering. Is it any wonder that
					humans exist in states of anxiety, depression, neurosis, and other forms of
					discontent?</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes, but to get into accord
						with them; they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the

					recognized is through the symptoms that are present in the conscious. Emotional
					suffering, Freud claims, is the result of unconscious conflict. We cannot
					continually fight against ourselves, against the uprising of repressed material,
					and against the force of death, without emotional turmoil.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Freud’s unique approach to the treatment of psychological ailments involved
					working with the conflicts that existed in the unconscious. He sought to free
					the patient from repressed memories and so alleviate their mental pain. His
					approach to treatment is called psychoanalytic psychotherapy, or psychoanalysis.
					This process is not easy or quick. Psychoanalysis is only performed by a
					therapist trained in Freud’s specific approach, and it is his therapy that
					encourages a patient to lie on a couch and talk. From Freud’s first treatments,
					psychoanalysis has been practiced in sessions that can sometimes last for hours,
					take place several times per week, and continue for many years.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;While unconscious thoughts cannot be retrieved through normal introspection,
					the unconscious can communicate with the conscious in some ways. It quietly
					communicates via our preferences, the frames of reference in which we tend to
					understand things, and the symbols that we are drawn to or create.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;During analysis, the analyst acts as a mediator, trying to allow unspoken
					thoughts or unbearable feelings to come to light. Messages arising from a
					conflict between the conscious and the unconscious are likely to be disguised,
					or encoded, and it is the psychoanalyst’s job to interpret the messages using
					the tools of psychoanalysis.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several techniques that allow the unconscious to emerge. One of the
					first to be discussed by Freud at length was dream analysis; he famously studied
					his own dreams in his book, <i class="calibre11">The Interpretation of
						Dreams</i>. He claimed that every dream enacts a wish fulfilment, and
					the more unpalatable the wish is to our conscious mind, the more hidden or
					distorted the desire becomes in our dreams. So the unconscious, he says, sends
					messages to our conscious mind in code. For instance, Freud discusses dreams
					where the dreamer is naked&mdash;the primary source for these dreams in most people is
					memories from early childhood, when nakedness was not frowned upon and there was
					no sense of shame. In dreams where the dreamer feels embarrassment, the other
					people in the dream generally seem oblivious, lending support to a
					wish-fulfilment interpretation where the dreamer wants to leave behind shame and
					restriction. Even buildings and structures have coded meanings; stairwells, mine
					shafts, locked doors, or a small building in a narrow recess all represent
					repressed sexual feelings, according to Freud.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to knowledge of the
						unconscious activities of the mind."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Sigmund Freud</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-351"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000117.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Salvador Dali’s</span><i class="calibre21"> The Persistence of Memory</i> (1931) is

					Freudian slips and the process of free association. A Freudian slip is a verbal
					error, or “slip of the tongue,” and it is said to reveal a repressed belief,
					thought, or emotion. It is an involuntary substitution of one word for another
					that sounds similar but inadvertently reveals something the person really feels.
					For instance, a man might thank a woman he finds desirable for making “the
						<i class="calibre11">breast</i> dinner ever,” the slip revealing
					his true thoughts. Freud used the free-association technique (developed by Carl
					Jung), whereby patients heard a word and were then invited to say the first word
					that came into their mind. He believed that this process allowed the unconscious
					to break through because our mind uses automatic associations, so “hidden”
					thoughts are voiced before the conscious mind has a chance to interrupt.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help an individual emerge from a repressed state and begin to
					consciously deal with the real issues that are affecting him or her, Freud
					believed that it is necessary to access repressed feelings. For example, if a
					man finds it difficult to confront others, he will choose to repress his
					feelings rather than deal with the confrontation. Over time, however, these
					repressed emotions build up and reveal themselves in other ways. Anger, anxiety,
					depression, drug and alcohol abuse, or eating disorders may all be the result of
					struggling to fend off feelings that have been repressed instead of being
					addressed. Unprocessed emotions, Freud asserts, are constantly threatening to
					break through, generating an increasingly uncomfortable tension and inciting
					more and more extreme measures to keep them down.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis allows trapped memories and feelings to emerge, and the patient is
					often surprised to feel the emotion that has been buried. It is not uncommon for
					patients to find themselves moved to tears by an issue from many years ago that
					they felt they had long since “got over.” This response demonstrates that the
					event and the emotion are still alive&mdash;still holding emotional energy&mdash;and have
					been repressed rather than dealt with. In Freudian terms, “catharsis” describes
					the act of releasing and feeling the deep emotions associated with repressed
					memories. If the significant event&mdash;such as the death of a parent&mdash;was not fully
					experienced at the time because it was too overwhelming, the difficulty and the
					energy remain, to be released at the moment of catharsis.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"The poets and philosophers before me discovered the unconscious; what I

					his ideas, eventually splitting the Society into three: the Freudians (who
					remained true to Freud’s original thoughts), the Kleinians (who followed the
					ideas of Melanie Klein), and the Neo-Freudians (a later group who incorporated
					Freud’s ideas into their broader practice). Modern psychoanalysis encompasses at
					least 22 different schools of thought, though Freud’s ideas continue to remain
					influential for all contemporary practitioners.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-354"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000165.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Freud’s patients</span> would recline on this

				but Freud’s approach was limited to addressing unconscious drives and the legacy of
				an individual’s past. Alfred Adler was the first psychoanalyst to expand
				psychological theory beyond the Freudian viewpoint, suggesting that a person’s
				psychology was also influenced by present and conscious forces, and that the
				influence of the social realm and environment was equally vital. Adler founded his
				own approach, individual psychology, based on these ideas.</p><p class="calibre13">Adler’s particular interest in inferiority and the positive and negative effects
				of self-esteem began early in his career, when he worked with patients who had
				physical disabilities. Looking at the effects that disability had on achievement and
				sense of self, he found huge differences between his patients. Some people with
				disabilities were able to reach high levels of athletic success, and Adler noted
				that in these personalities, the disability served as a strong motivational force.
				At the other extreme, he witnessed patients who felt defeated by their disability
				and who made little effort to improve their situation. Adler realized that the
				differences came down to how these individuals viewed themselves: in other words,
				their self-esteem.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-359"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000124.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-360"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000217.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A paralympic athlete</span> may be driven by a

					rooted in childhood. Children naturally feel inferior because they are
					constantly surrounded by stronger, more powerful people with greater abilities.
					A child generally seeks to emulate and achieve the abilities of its elders,
					motivated by the surrounding forces that propel him toward his own development
					and accomplishments.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Children and adults with a healthy and balanced personality gain confidence
					each time they realize that they are capable of meeting external goals. Feelings
					of inferiority dissipate until the next challenge presents itself and is
					overcome; this process of psychic growth is continual. However, an individual
					with a physical inferiority may develop more generalized feelings of inferiority&mdash;leading to an unbalanced personality and what Adler termed an “inferiority
					complex,” where the feelings of inferiority are never relieved.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Adler also recognized the equally unbalanced “superiority complex,” manifested
					in a constant need to strive toward goals. When attained, these goals do not
					instil confidence in the individual, but merely prompt him to continually seek

				forces outside ourselves, such as God or fate, we are motivated and controlled by
				the inner workings of our own minds, specifically, the unconscious. He claimed that
				our experiences are affected by primal drives contained in the unconscious. His
				protégé, the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, took this idea further, delving into the
				elements that make up the unconscious and its workings.</p><p class="calibre13">Jung was fascinated by the way that societies around the world share certain
				striking similarities, despite being culturally very different. They share an
				uncanny commonality in their myths and symbols, and have for thousands of years. He
				thought that this must be due to something larger than the individual experience of
				man; the symbols, he decided, must exist as part of the human psyche.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to Jung that the existence of these shared myths proved that part of the
				human psyche contains ideas that are held in a timeless structure, which acts as a
				form of “collective memory.” Jung introduced the notion that one distinct and
				separate part of the unconscious exists within each of us, which is not based on any
				of our own individual experiences&mdash;this is the “collective unconscious.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The commonly found myths and symbols are, for Jung, part of this universally
				shared collective unconscious. He believed that the symbols exist as part of
				hereditary memories that are passed on from generation to generation, changing only
				slightly in their attributes across different cultures and time periods. These
				inherited memories emerge within the psyche in the language of symbols, which Jung
				calls “archetypes.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-366"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000024.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-367"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000269.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The tale of Snow White</span> can be found all

					constitute the entirety of the human experience. The Latin word <i class="calibre11">archetypum</i> translates as “first-molded,” and Jung
					believed that archetypes are memories from the experiences of our first
					ancestors. They act as templates within the psyche that we use unconsciously to
					organize and understand our own experience. We may fill out the gaps with
					details from our individual lives, but it is this preexisting substructure in
					the unconscious that is the framework that allows us to make sense of our
					experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archetypes can be thought of as inherited emotional or behavioral patterns.
					They allow us to recognize a particular set of behaviors or emotional
					expressions as a unified pattern that has meaning. It seems that we do this
					instinctively, but Jung says that what seems to be instinct is actually the
					unconscious use of archetypes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung suggests that the psyche is composed of three components: the ego, the
					personal unconscious, and the collective unconscious. The ego, he says,
					represents the conscious mind or self, while the personal unconscious contains
					the individual’s own memories, including those that have been suppressed. The
					collective unconscious is the part of the psyche that houses the
					archetypes.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"The personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer… I call the collective
						unconscious."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Carl Jung</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The archetypes</h2></div><p class="calibre14">There are many archetypes, and though they can blend and mold into each other
					in different cultures, each of us contains within us the model of each
					archetype. Since we use these symbolic forms to make sense of the world and our
					experiences, they appear in all human forms of expression, such as art,
					literature, and drama.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of an archetype is such that we recognize it instantly and are able
					to attach to it a specific, emotional meaning. Archetypes can be associated with
					many kinds of behavioral and emotional patterns, but there are certain prominent
					ones that are highly recognizable, such as The Wise Old Man, The Goddess, The
					Madonna, the Great Mother, and The Hero.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Persona is one of the most important archetypes described by Jung. He
					recognized early in his own life that he had a tendency to share only a certain
					part of his personality with the outside world. He also recognized this trait in
					other people, and noted that human beings divide their personalities into
					components, selectively sharing only certain components of their selves
					according to the environment and situation. The self that we present to the
					world&mdash;our public image&mdash;is an archetype, which Jung calls the “Persona.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung believes that the self has both masculine and feminine parts, and is
					molded into becoming fully male or female by society as much as biology. When we
					become wholly male or female we turn our backs on half of our potential, though
					we can still access this part of the self through an archetype. The Animus
					exists as the masculine component of the female personality, and the Anima as
					the feminine attributes of the male psyche. This is the “other half”, the half
					that was taken from us as we grew into a girl or boy. These archetypes help us
					to understand the nature of the opposite sex, and because they contain “deposits
					of all the impressions ever made” by a man or woman, so they necessarily reflect
					the traditional ideas of masculine and feminine.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animus is represented in our culture as the “real man;” he is the muscle
					man, the commander of soldiers, the cool logician, and the romantic seducer. The
					Anima appears as a wood nymph, a virgin, a seductress. She can be close to
					nature, intuitive, and spontaneous. She appears in paintings and stories as Eve,
					or Helen of Troy, or a personality such as Marilyn Monroe, bewitching men or
					sucking the life from them. As these archetypes exist in our unconscious, they
					can affect our moods and reactions, and can manifest themselves as prophetic
					statements (Anima) or unbending rationality (Animus).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung defines one archetype as representing the part of ourselves we do not
					want the world to see. He calls it the Shadow, and it is the opposite of the
					Persona, representing all our secret or repressed thoughts and the shameful
					aspects of our character. It appears in the Bible as the devil, and in
					literature as Dr Jekyll’s Mr. Hyde. The Shadow is the “bad” side of ourselves
					that we project onto others, and yet it is not entirely negative; it may
					represent aspects that we choose to suppress only because they are unacceptable
					in a particular situation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the archetypes, the most important is the True Self. This is a central,
					organizing archetype that attempts to harmonize all other aspects into a
					unified, whole self. According to Jung, the real goal of human existence is to
					achieve an advanced, enlightened psychological state of being that he refers to
					as “self-realization,” and the route to this lies in the archetype of the True
					Self. When fully realized, this archetype is the source of wisdom and truth, and
					is able to connect the self to the spiritual. Jung stressed that
					self-realization does not happen automatically, it must be consciously
					sought.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-370"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000066.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Eve is one representation</span> of the Anima,

					Jung believed that dreams are a dialogue between the conscious self and the
					eternal (the ego and the collective unconscious), and that the archetypes
					operate as symbols within the dream, facilitating the dialogue.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The archetypes have specific meanings in the context of dreams. For instance,
					the archetype of The Wise Old Man or Woman may be represented in a dream by a
					spiritual leader, parent, teacher, or doctor&mdash;it indicates those who offer
					guidance, direction, and wisdom. The Great Mother, an archetype who might appear
					as the dreamer’s own mother or grandmother, represents the nurturer. She
					provides reassurance, comfort, and validation. The Divine Child, the archetype
					that represents your True Self in its purest form, symbolizing innocence or
					vulnerability, would appear as a baby or child in dreams, suggesting openness or
					potential. And lest the ego grow too large, it is kept in check by the
					appearance of the Trickster, a playful archetype that exposes the dreamer’s
					vulnerabilities and plays jokes, preventing the individual from taking himself
					and his desires too seriously. The Trickster also appears as the Norse half-god
					Loki, the Greek god Pan, the African spider god Anansi, or simply a magician or
					clown.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"All the most powerful ideas in history go back to archetypes."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Carl Jung</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-373" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Using the archetypes</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The archetypes exist in our minds before conscious thought, and can therefore
					have an immensely powerful impact on our perception of experience. Whatever we
					may consciously think is happening, what we choose to perceive&mdash;and therefore
					experience&mdash;is governed by these preformed ideas within the unconscious. In this
					way, the collective unconscious and its contents affect the conscious state.
					According to Jung, much of what we generally attribute to deliberate, reasoned,
					conscious thinking is actually already being guided by unconscious activity,
					especially the organizing forms of the archetypes.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his ideas of the collective unconscious and the archetypes,
					Jung was the first to explore the practice of word association, and he also
					introduced the concepts of the extrovert and introvert personality types. These
					ultimately inspired widely used personality tests such as the Myers&mdash;Briggs Type
					Indicator (MBTI). Jung’s work was influential in the fields of psychology,
					anthropology, and spirituality, and his archetypes are so widespread that they
					can easily be identified in film, literature, and other cultural forms that
					attempt to portray universal characters.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"By understanding the unconscious we free ourselves from its

					Rauschenbach in 1903 and they had five children.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung trained in psychiatry, but after meeting Sigmund Freud in 1907, he became
					a psychoanalyst and Freud’s heir apparent. However, the pair grew estranged over
					theoretical differences and never met again. In the years following World War I,
					Jung traveled widely through Africa, America, and India, studying native people
					and taking part in anthropological and archaeological expeditions. He became a
					professor at the University of Zurich in 1935, but gave up teaching to
					concentrate on research.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1912 </b><i class="calibre11"> Symbols of Transformation</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1934 </b><i class="calibre11"> The Archetypes and the Collective

				philosophers, and scientists. Literature, religion, and art are filled with tales of
				good and evil, of friend and foe. Newtonian physics states that stability or balance
				is achieved through one force being countered by an equal and opposite force. Such
				opposing forces appear to be an essential part of existence, and perhaps the most
				powerful of them are the instinctive drives we have for life and death.</p><p class="calibre13">Sigmund Freud said that to avoid being destroyed by our own death instinct, we
				employ our narcissistic or self-regarding life instinct (libido) to force the death
				instinct outward, directing it against other objects. Melanie Klein expanded on
				this, saying that even as we redirect the death force outwards, we still sense the
				danger of being destroyed by “this instinct of aggression;” we acknowledge the huge
				task of “mobilizing the libido” against it. Living with these opposing forces is an
				inherent psychological conflict that is central to human experience. Klein claimed
				that our tendencies toward growth and creation&mdash;from procreation to creativity&mdash;are
				forced to run constantly against an equally powerful and destructive force, and that
				this ongoing psychic tension underlies all suffering.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also stated that this psychic tension explains our innate tendency toward
				aggression and violence. It creates a related struggle between love and hate,
				present even in a newborn baby. This constant battle between our life and death
				instincts&mdash;between pleasure and pain, renewal and destruction&mdash;results in confusion
				within our psyches. Anger or “bad” feelings may then become directed toward every
				situation, whether they are good or bad.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-378"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000284.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-379"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000259.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Drama’s power</span> lies in its reflection of

					notions of happiness are impossible to attain, and that living is about finding
					a way to tolerate the conflict; it is not about achieving nirvana.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As this state of tolerance is the best that we can hope for, Klein found it
					unsurprising that life falls short of what people desire or believe they
					deserve, resulting in depression and disappointment. Human experience, to Klein,
					is inevitably filled with anxiety, pain, loss, and destruction. People must,
					therefore, learn to work within the extremes of life and death.</p></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-381"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MELANIE KLEIN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-382"><img alt="" src="images/000231.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">One of four children, Melanie Klein was born in Austria.

				self-determined beliefs, but from those internalized from a toxic environment. These
				play out as internalized messages, especially in the form of “shoulds,” such as “I
				should be recognized and powerful” or “I should be thin.” She taught her patients to
				become aware of two influences in their psyche: the “real self” with authentic
				desires, and the “ideal self” that strives to fulfil all the demands of the
				“shoulds.” The ideal self fills the mind with ideas that are unrealistic and
				inappropriate to the journey of the real self, and generates negative feedback based
				on the “failures” of the real self to achieve the expectations of the ideal self.
				This leads to the development of a third, unhappy self&mdash;the “despised self.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Horney says the “shoulds” are the basis of our “bargain with fate;” if we obey
				them, we believe we can magically control external realities, though in reality they

				human unconscious, proposing a psychic apparatus of three parts: the id, the
				superego, and the ego.</p><p class="calibre13">The id, like a sneaky serpent, whispers to us to do what feels good. It is driven
				entirely by desire, seeking pleasure and the fulfilment of basic drives (such as
				food, comfort, warmth, and sex). The superego, like a righteous presence, calls us
				to follow the higher path. It imposes parental and societal values and tells us what
				we should and should not do. Lastly, the ego&mdash;like a decision-making adult&mdash;controls
				impulses and forms judgments on how to act; it is the moderator, suspended between
				the id and the superego.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Austrian psychoanalyst Anna Freud expanded upon her father’s ideas, drawing
				attention to the formation of the superego and its effects upon the ego. The ego
				takes account of the realities of the world, and is also simultaneously engaged with
				the id and relegated to an inferior position by the superego. The superego speaks

				revolutionized our thinking about the world by pointing out that we can never really
				know what is “out there” beyond ourselves, because our knowledge is limited to the
				constraints of our minds and senses. We don’t know how things are “in themselves”,
				but only as we experience them. This view forms the basis of Gestalt therapy, which
				says that it is vitally important to remember that the complexity of the human
				experience&mdash;with its tragedies and traumas, inspirations and passions, and its nearly
				infinite range of possibilities&mdash;is coded by the individual “lenses” through which we
				view it. We do not automatically absorb all the sounds, feelings, and pictures of
				the world; we scan and select just a few.</p><p class="calibre13">Fritz Perls, one of the founders of Gestalt therapy, pointed out that this means
				our personal sense of reality is created through our perception; through the ways in
				which we view our experiences, not the events themselves. However, it is easy to
				forget this, or even fail to recognize it. He says we tend to mistake our viewpoint
				of the world for the absolute, objective truth, rather than acknowledging the role
				of perception and its influence in creating our perspective, together with all the
				ideas, actions, and beliefs that stem from it. For Perls, the only truth one can
				ever have is one’s own personal truth.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-390"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000130.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Learning is the discovery that something is possible."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Fritz Perls</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-391" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Accepting responsibility</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Perls developed his theories in the 1940s, when the dominant psychoanalytical
					view was that the human mind could be reduced to a series of biological drives
					seeking fulfilment. This approach was far too rigid, structured, simplified, and
					generalized for Perls; it did not allow for individual experience, which Perls
					held paramount. Nor did its analysts enable their patients to recognize and take
					responsibility for the creation of their experience. The psychoanalytical model
					operates on the understanding that patients are at the mercy of their
					unconscious conflicts until an analyst enters to save them from their
					unconscious drives. Perls, on the other hand, feels it is essential for people
					to understand the power of their own roles in creation. He wants to make us
					aware that we can change our realities, and in fact are responsible for doing
					so. No one else can do it for us. Once we realize that perception is the
					backbone of reality, each of us is forced to take responsibility for the life we
					create and the way we choose to view the world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-392"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000012.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Gestalt prayer</span> was written by Fritz

					responsibility&mdash;both for one’s thoughts and feelings&mdash;to encourage personal growth
					by establishing a sense of internal control. Perls insists that we can learn to
					control our inner experience, regardless of our external environment. Once we
					understand that our perception shapes our experience, we can see how the roles
					we play and the actions we take are tools, which we can then use consciously for
					changing reality. Control of our own inner psychic environment gives us power
					through two layers of choice: in how to interpret the environment, and how to
					react to it. The adage, “no one can make you angry other than yourself,”
					perfectly exemplifies this philosophy, and its truth can be seen played out in
					the different ways that people react to traffic jams, bad news, or personal
					criticism, for example.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gestalt therapy, a person is forced to take direct responsibility for how
					he or she acts and reacts, regardless of what may seem to be happening. Perls
					refers to this ability to maintain emotional stability regardless of the
					environment as “homeostasis,” using a biological term normally used to describe
					the maintenance of a stable physical environment within the body. It implies a
					fine balancing of many systems, and this is how Gestalt therapy views the mind.
					It looks for ways of balancing the mind through the many thoughts, feelings, and
					perceptions that make up the whole human experience. It views a person
					holistically and places the focus firmly on the whole, not the parts.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perls saw his task as helping his patients to cultivate an awareness of the
					power of their perceptions, and how they shape reality (or what we describe as
					“reality”). In this way, his patients became able to take control of shaping
					their interior landscape. In taking responsibility for their perceived sense of
					reality, they could create the reality they wanted.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perls helped his patients achieve this through teaching them the integral
					processes of Gestalt therapy. The first and most important process is learning
					to cultivate awareness and to focus that awareness on the feelings of the
					present moment. This allows the individual to directly experience his or her
					feelings and perceived reality in the present moment. This ability, to “be here
					now” is critical to the Gestalt process; it is an acute emotional awareness, and
					one that forms the foundation for understanding how each of us creates and
					reacts to our own environment. It also offers a pathway for learning how to
					change the ways we experience ourselves and our environment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a tool for personal growth, the ability to get in touch with authentic
					feelings&mdash;true thoughts and emotions&mdash;is more important to Perls than the
					psychological explanations or analytic feedback of other forms of therapy. The
					“why” behind behavior holds little significance for Perls; what is important is
					the “how” and “what.” This devaluing of the need to find out “why” and the shift
					of responsibility for meaning from analyst to patient brought with it a profound
					change in the therapist&mdash;patient hierarchy. Where previous approaches in therapy
					generally involved a therapist manipulating the patient toward the therapeutic
					goal, the Gestalt approach is characterized by a warm, empathic relationship
					between therapist and patient, who work together as partners toward the goal.
					The therapist is dynamic but does not lead the patient; the Gestalt approach of
					Perls would later form the basis of Carl Rogers’ humanistic, person-centerd
					approach.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Lose your mind and come to your senses."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Fritz Perls</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-394" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A denial of fate</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Another component in the Gestalt method involves the use of language. One
					critical tool patients are given for increasing self-awareness is the
					instruction to notice and change the use of the word “I” within speech. Perls
					says that to take responsibility for our reality, we must recognize how we use
					language to give the illusion that we have no control when this is not the case.
					By simply rephrasing “I can’t do that” to “I won’t do that,” it becomes clear
					that I am making a choice. This also helps to establish ownership of feeling;
					emotions arise in and belong to me; I cannot blame someone or something else for
					my feelings.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples of language change include replacing the word “should” with
					“want,” changing, for example, ”I should leave now” to “I want to leave now.”
					This also acts to reveal the element of choice. As we learn to take
					responsibility for our experience, Perls says, we develop authentic selves that
					are free from society’s influence. We also experience self-empowerment as we
					realize that we are not at the mercy of things that “just happen.” Feelings of
					victimization dissolve once we understand that what we accept for ourselves in
					our lives&mdash;what we selectively perceive and experience&mdash;is a choice; we are not
					powerless.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;With this personal responsibility comes the obligation to refuse to experience
					events, relationships, or circumstances that we know to be wrong for our
					authentic selves. Gestalt theory also asks us to look closely at what we choose
					to accept among our society’s norms. We may have acted under the assumption of
					their truth for so long that we automatically accept them. Perls says we need
					instead to adopt beliefs that best inspire and develop our authentic self. The
					ability to write our own personal rules, determine our own opinions,
					philosophies, desires, and interests is of the essence. As we increase our
					awareness of self-accountability, self-reliance, and self-insight, we understand
					that we are building our own world, or truth. The lives we are living become
					easier to bear, because “truth can be tolerated only if you discover it
					yourself.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-395"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000080.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The 1960s hippie culture</span> chimed with

					path and one’s own ideas fitted perfectly within the 1960s counter-culture
					revolution of the Western world. But this focus on individualism was seen by
					some psychologists and analysts as a weakness within the therapy, especially by
					those who view human beings as, above all, social beings. They claim that a life
					lived along Gestalt principles would exclude the possibility of intimacy with
					another, and that it focuses too much on the individual at the expense of the
					community. In response, supporters of Gestalt therapy have claimed that without
					the development of an authentic self, it would not be possible to develop an
					authentic relationship with another.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, Perls became a regular lecturer at the Esalen Institute in
					California, becoming a lasting influence on this renowned center for spiritual
					and psychological development. After an explosion of popularity in the 1970s,
					Gestalt therapy fell out of favor, but its tenets were accepted into the roots
					of other forms of therapy. Gestalt is today recognized as one of many “standard”
					approaches to therapy.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"If you need encouragement, praise, pats on the back from everybody, then

				was lacking in love and support, he or she will be able to settle and flourish with
				a new family that provides what is needed. However, while stability and acceptance
				help to give a foundation in which a child can grow and find a healthy state of
				being, these qualities make up only one part of what is required.</p><p class="calibre13">As the first pediatrician in England to train as a psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott
				had a unique insight into the mother-infant relationship and the developmental
				process of children. He was strongly influenced by Sigmund Freud but also by the
				writings of Melanie Klein, particularly regarding the unconscious feelings of the
				mother or carer for the infant. Winnicott began his career by working with children
				displaced by World War II and he examined the difficulties faced by children who are
				trying to adapt to a new home.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;As Winnicott notes in his paper, <i class="calibre11">Hate in the
					Countertransference</i>: “It is notoriously inadequate to take an adopted
				child into one’s home and love him.” In fact, the parents must be able to take the
				adopted child into their home and be able to tolerate hating him. Winnicott states
				that a child can believe he or she is loved only after being hated; he stresses that
				the role that “tolerance of hate” plays in healing cannot be underestimated.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnicott explains that when a child has been deprived of proper parental
				nurturing, and is then granted a chance of this in a healthy family environment,
				such as with an adoptive or foster family, the child begins to develop unconscious
				hope. But fear is associated with this hope. When a child has been so devastatingly
				disappointed in the past, with even basic emotional or physical needs unsatisfied,
				defenses arise. These are unconscious forces that protect the child against the hope
				that may lead to disappointment. The defenses, maintains Winnicott, explain the
				presence of hatred. The child will “act out” in an outburst of anger against the new
				parental figure, expressing hatred and, in turn, invoking hatred from the carer. He
				termed the behavior an “antisocial tendency.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Winnicott, for a child who has suffered, the need to hate and be
				hated is deeper even than the need for rebellion, and the importance of the carer
				tolerating the hate is an essential factor in the healing of the child. Winnicott
				says that the child must be allowed to express the hatred, and the parent must be
				able to tolerate both the child’s and their own hatred as well.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea may be shocking, and people may struggle with the notion that they feel
				hatred rising within them. They may feel guilty, because the child has been through
				such difficulties already. Yet the child is actively behaving hatefully toward the
				parent, projecting past experiences of being neglected and ignored onto present-day
				reality.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The child of a broken home or without parents, Winnicott says, “spends his time
				unconsciously looking for his parents” and so feelings from past relationships are
				displaced onto another adult. The child has internalized the hate, and sees it even
				when it is no longer present. In his new situation, the child needs to see what
				happens when hatred is in the air. Winnicott explains: “What happens is that after a
				while a child so adopted gains hope, and then he starts to test out the environment
				he has found, and to seek proof of his guardian’s ability to hate
				objectively.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways for a child to express hatred and prove that he or she is
				indeed not worthy of being loved. This worthlessness is the message that was
				imparted by earlier, negative parental experiences. From the child’s point of view,
				he is attempting to protect himself from the risk of ever having to feel love or to
				be loved because of the potential disappointment that accompanies that state of
				being.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-402"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000387.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"It seems that an adopted child can believe in being loved only after reaching

					child’s teachers and other authority figures, are very real. Winnicott believes
					that it is essential that adults acknowledge these feelings, rather than deny
					them, which might seem easier. They also need to understand that the child’s
					hatred is not personal; the child is expressing anxiety about his previous
					unhappy situation with the person who is now at hand.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;What the authority figure does with their own hatred, of course, is of
					critical importance. The child’s belief that he or she is “bad” and unworthy of
					being loved must not be reinforced by the response from the adult; the adult
					must simply tolerate the feelings of hatred and realize that these feelings are
					part of the relationship. This is the only way the child will feel secure and be
					able to form an attachment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how loving a new environment may be, it does not erase the past for
					the child; there will still be residual feelings as a result of their past
					experience. Winnicott sees no short cuts to a resolution. The child is expecting
					that the adult’s feelings of hatred will lead to rejection, because that is what
					has happened before; when the hatred does not lead to rejection and is tolerated
					instead, it can begin to dissipate.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-405"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000339.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Despite feeling</span> the unconscious and
							natural negative feelings provoked by the child, a parent must provide
							an environment that “holds” the child, making him or her feel
							secure.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-406" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Healthy hatred</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Even in psychologically healthy families with children who have not been
					displaced, Winnicott believes unconscious hatred is a natural, essential part of
					the parenting experience and speaks of “hating appropriately.” Melanie Klein had
					suggested that a baby feels hatred for its mother, but Winnicott proposes that
					this is preceded by the mother hating the baby&mdash;and that even before this, there
					is an extraordinary primitive or “ruthless” love. The baby’s existence places
					huge demands on the mother psychologically and physically and these evoke
					feelings of hatred in the mother. Winnicott’s list of 18 reasons why the mother
					hates the baby include: that the pregnancy and birth have endangered her life;
					that the baby is an interference with her private life; that the baby hurts her
					when nursing, even biting her; and that the baby “treats her as scum, an unpaid
					servant, a slave.” Despite all of this she also loves him, “excretions and all”,
					says Winnicott, with a hugely powerful, primitive love, and has to learn how to
					tolerate hating her baby without in any way acting on it. If she cannot hate
					appropriately, he claims, she turns the feelings of hatred toward herself, in a
					way that is masochistic and unhealthy.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-407" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Therapeutic relationship</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Winnicott also used the relationship between the parent and child as an
					analogy for the therapeutic relationship between therapist and client. The
					feelings that arise in a therapist during analysis are part of a phenomenon
					known as “countertransference.” Feelings that are aroused in the client during
					therapy&mdash;usually feelings about parents or siblings&mdash;are transferred onto the
					therapist. In his paper, Winnicott described how as part of the analysis, the
					therapist feels hate toward the client, though this hate was generated by the
					patient as a necessary part of testing that the therapist can bear it. The
					patient needs to know that the therapist is strong and reliable enough to
					withstand this onslaught.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-408" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A realistic approach</h2></div><p class="calibre14">While some of Winnicott’s ideas may appear shocking, he believes we should be
					realistic about bringing up children, avoiding sentimentality in favor of
					honesty. This enables us as children, and later as adults, to acknowledge and
					deal with natural, unavoidable negative feelings. Winnicott is a realist and
					pragmatist; he refuses to believe in the mythical idea of “the perfect family”
					or in a world where a few kind words wipe away all of the horrors that may have
					preceded it. He prefers to see the real environment and mental states of our
					experience, and asks us to do likewise, with courageous honesty. His ideas did
					not fit neatly into one school of thought, though they were hugely influential,
					and continue to impact on social work, education, developmental psychology, and
					psychoanalysis around the world.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Sentimentality in a mother is no good at all from the infant’s point of

				memories that we wish to push aside are stored, and cannot be retrieved consciously.
				The unconscious sometimes speaks to the conscious self in limited ways: Carl Jung
				believed that the unconscious presents itself to the waking self through dreams,
				symbols, and in the language of archetypes, while Freud saw it as expressing itself
				through motivational behavior and accidental “slips of the tongue.” The one thing
				that the various psychoanalytical schools do agree on is that the unconscious holds
				a bigger picture than that retained by the conscious self. For French psychiatrist
				Jacques Lacan, however, the language of the unconscious is not that of the self, but
				of the “Other.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-413"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000266.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-414" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A sense of self</h2></div><p class="calibre14">We easily take for granted the notion of the self&mdash;that each of us exists as a
					separate, individual being, who views the world through our own eyes, is
					familiar with the boundaries that separate us from others and from the world
					around us, and assumes a separateness in thinking and in the way we interact
					with our environment. But what if there was nothing out there that we could
					recognize as being separate from ourselves? We would then be unable to
					conceptualize our sense of self, because there would be no delineated being to
					think about. The only way we have of determining that as individuals we are
					distinct from the world all around us is our ability to recognize the
					separateness of ourselves from our environment, or from the Other, which allows
					us to become the subject “I.” Lacan therefore concluded that each of us is a
					“self” only because we have a concept of the Other.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lacan, the Other is the absolute otherness that lies beyond the self; it
					is the environment into which we are born, and which we have to “translate” or
					make sense of, in order to survive and thrive. An infant must learn to assemble
					sensations into concepts and categories in order to function in the world, and
					he or she does this through gradually acquiring an awareness and understanding
					of a series of signifiers&mdash;signs or codes. But these signifiers can only come to
					us from the external world that lies beyond the self, therefore they must have
					been formed from the language&mdash;or what Lacan prefers to call the “discourse”&mdash;of
					the Other.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only able to think or to express our ideas and emotions through
					language, and the only language we have, according to Lacan, is that of the
					Other. The sensations and images that translate into the thoughts of our
					unconscious must therefore be constructed from this language of the Other, or,
					as Lacan stated, “the unconscious is the discourse of the Other.” This idea has
					had a wide influence on the practice of psychoanalysis, leading to a more
					objective and open interpretation of the unconscious.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"The I is always in the field of the Other."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jacques Lacan</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-415"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000240.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Our sense of self</span> is shaped by our

					Lacan remained in occupied Paris during World War II, working at the

				characteristic of humankind. According to the German-American psychoanalyst Erich
				Fromm, it also determines whether we follow a path of joy and fulfilment or tread a
				road of dissatisfaction and strife. Fromm believed that although life is inherently
				painful, we can make it bearable by giving it meaning, through pursuing and
				constructing an authentic self. The ultimate aim of a human life is to develop what
				Fromm described as “the most precious quality man is endowed with&mdash;the love of
				life.”</p><p class="calibre13">Life is inherently fraught with emotional frustration, according to Fromm, because
				man lives in a state of struggle. He is constantly trying to balance his individual
				nature&mdash;his existence as a separate being&mdash;with his need for connection. There is a
				part of man’s inherent self that only knows how to exist in a united state with
				others; it lives at one with nature and at one with other people. Yet we see
				ourselves as separated from nature, and isolated from one another. Worse still, we
				have the unique capacity to ponder the fact of this separation and think about our
				isolation. Man, gifted with reason, is life being aware of itself.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fromm suggests that our separation from nature originated with the growth of
				intellect, which has made us aware of our separateness. It is our ability to reason
				and relate that lets us transcend nature. It provides the capabilities for
				productive living and affords us intellectual superiority, but it also makes us
				realize that we exist alone in this world. Reason makes us aware of our own
				mortality and the mortality of our loved ones. This understanding creates a chronic
				source of tension and an unbearable loneliness that we are always seeking to
				overcome; man’s inherent state of being is one of anxiety and hopelessness. But
				there is hope, Fromm insists, because man can overcome his sense of isolation and
				alienation through finding his purpose.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we strive to become free, unique individuals, we still feel the need
				for unity with others, and in trying to balance these needs we may seek out the
				comfort of conforming to a group or an authority. This is a misguided approach, says
				Fromm; it is imperative to discover one’s own independent sense of self, and one’s
				own personal views and value systems, rather than adhering to conventional or
				authoritarian norms. If we try to hand responsibility for our choices to other
				people or institutions we become alienated from ourselves, when the very purpose of
				our lives is to define ourselves through embracing our personal uniqueness,
				discovering our own ideas and abilities, and embracing that which differentiates
				each of us from other people. Man’s main task is to give birth to himself. In doing
				so, he frees himself from confusion, loneliness, and apathy.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-420"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000163.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"It seems that nothing is more difficult for the average man to bear than the

					wholeness we seek is through the discovery of our individuality.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;We can achieve this by following our own ideas and passions, and through
					creative purpose, because “creativity requires the courage to let go of
					certainties.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the critical ways in which man delivers himself from isolation is
					through his capacity to love. Fromm’s concept of love is vastly different from
					popular understandings of the word. To Fromm, love is not an emotion, nor is it
					dependent on finding an object to love. It is an interpersonal creative capacity
					that one must actively develop as part of one’s personality. He says “it is an
					attitude, an ordination of character which determines the relatedness of the
					person to the whole world.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of personal love for another, Fromm says that the main tenets are
					care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge&mdash;an objective knowledge of what
					other people truly want and need. Love is only possible through respecting the
					separateness and uniqueness of ourselves and of another; paradoxically, this is
					how we develop the ability to create connectedness. Love demands a great amount
					of respect for the other person as an individual, and it is based on autonomy,
					not a blending of personalities. In our overwhelming desire to connect and
					unify, we try to love but our relationships often result in an unloving
					imbalance. We think we are loving, but in reality we may be seeking another form
					of conformity. We say “I love you” when really we mean “I see me in you,” “I
					will become you,” or “I will possess you.” In loving, we try to lose our
					uniqueness, or steal it from the other person. Our yearning to exist “as one”
					makes us want to see ourselves reflected in other people, which in turn leads us
					to artificially impose our own traits onto someone else.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to love, says Fromm, is to love freely, granting the other person
					their full individuality; to respect the other person’s differing opinions,
					preferences, and belief systems. Love is not found by fitting one person into
					another’s mold, and it is not a question of finding the perfect “match.” It is,
					he says, “union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the
					condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one’s own self.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people spend vast amounts of time and money attempting to cultivate the
					self that they feel is most worthy of acceptance, and most likely to result in
					being loved or desired. This is futile, because only a person who has a strong
					sense of self, and can stand firmly within their own understanding of the world,
					is able to give freely to others and love in an authentic way. Those who tend to
					orient themselves toward receiving love instead of being loving will fail; they
					will also seek to establish a receiving relationship in other ways, always
					wanting to be given things&mdash;material or immaterial&mdash;rather than to give. These
					people believe the source of all good things lies outside themselves, and they
					constantly feel the need to acquire, though this brings no relief.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"‘Know thyself’ is one of the fundamental commands that aim at human

					because they enable people to avoid assuming true responsibility for their
					actions and prevent productive, personal growth. Each of the four main
					nonproductive types&mdash;receptive, exploitative, hoarding, and marketing&mdash;have both
					positive and negative sides. A fifth type, necrophilous, is unremittingly
					negative, and a sixth type&mdash;the productive personality&mdash;is Fromm’s ideal. In
					reality, our personalities are generally drawn from a mix of the four main
					types.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A person with a “receptive” orientation is said to live passively in the
					status quo, accepting the lot handed to them. These people follow rather than
					lead; they have things done to them. In extremes, this is the stance of the
					victim, but on the positive side, it is rich in devotion and acceptance. Fromm
					compares this type to the peasants and migrant workers of history.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “exploitative” orientation thrives on taking from others; exploitative
					people take what they need instead of earning or creating. However, they show
					extreme self-confidence and strong initiative. This type is typified by
					historical aristocracies who took power and wealth from indigenous populations
					to line their own pockets.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hoarders” are always seeking friends in high places and rank even loved ones
					in terms of their value, seeing them as something owned. Power-hungry and
					ungenerous, at best they are pragmatic and economical. Historically, these are
					the middle classes, or bourgeoisie, that rise in great numbers during economic
					depressions.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The last of the main types is the “marketing” orientation. These people are
					obsessed with image and with how to successfully advertise and sell themselves.
					Every choice is evaluated in terms of reflected status, from the clothes, cars,
					and vacations they buy to marriage into the “right” family. At worst, they are
					opportunistic, tactless, and shallow; at best, they are highly motivated,
					purposeful, and energetic. This type is most representative of modern society,
					in its ever-growing acquisitiveness and self-consciousness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The most negative personality type&mdash;necrophilous&mdash;seeks only to destroy. Deeply
					afraid of the disorderly and uncontrollable nature of life, necrophilous types
					love to talk about sickness and death, and are obsessed with the need to impose
					“law and order.” They prefer mechanical objects to other people. In moderation,
					these people are pessimistic nay-sayers whose glasses are perpetually half
					empty, never half full.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fromm’s last personality type, the productive orientation, genuinely seeks and
					finds a legitimate solution to life through flexibility, learning, and
					sociability. Aiming to “become one” with the world and so escape the loneliness
					of separation, productive people respond to the world with rationality and an
					open mind, willing to change their beliefs in the light of new evidence. A
					productive person can truly love another for who they are, not as a trophy or
					safeguard against the world. Fromm calls this brave person “the man without a
					mask.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fromm’s work has a unique perspective, drawing on psychology, sociology, and
					political thinking, especially the writings of Karl Marx. His writing, aimed at
					a mainstream audience, influenced the general public more than academia&mdash;mainly
					because of his insistence on the freedom of ideas. He is nonetheless recognized
					as a leading contributor to humanistic psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-424"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000111.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Life has an inner dynamism of its own; it tends to grow, to be expressed,

					Frankfurt am Main, Germany. A thoughtful young man, he was initially influenced
					by his Talmudic studies, but later turned toward Karl Marx and socialist theory,

					hostility he witnessed during World War I, he studied jurisprudence, then
					sociology (to PhD level), before training in psychoanalysis. After the Nazis
					took power in Germany in 1933, Fromm moved to Switzerland and then New York,
					where he established a psychoanalytic practice and taught at Columbia
					University.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fromm married three times and had a well-documented affair with Karen Horney

				to psychological treatment was based on the idea that mental illness was a fixed
				pathological malady that needed to be cured. Popular psychoanalytic theory, for
				example, defined people struggling with their mental health as “neurotic.” Mental
				illness was seen in a negative light and most psychological practices and theories
				of the time offered strict definitions with structured explanations of the
				underlying causes of the mental illness, and fixed methods to cure it.</p><p class="calibre13">American psychologist Carl Rogers took a much more esoteric route to mental
				health, and in so doing expanded the approach of psychotherapy forever. He felt that
				the philosophies of the time were too structured and rigid to account for something
				as dynamic as the human experience, and that humanity is much too diverse to be
				fitted into delineated categories.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-430"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000195.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The subjective human being has an important value… that no matter how he may

					specific fixed state; good mental health is not something that is suddenly
					achieved at the end of a series of steps. Nor is it attained because an
					individual’s previously neurotic state of tension has been reduced by the
					satisfaction of biological drives and impulses, as the psychoanalysts insisted.
					Neither is it cultivated by following a specific program designed to develop and
					preserve a state of inner impermeable homeostasis, or balance, reducing the
					effect of the world’s external chaos on the self, as the behaviorists
					recommended.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers does not believe that anyone exists in a defective state that needs to
					be fixed in order to provide them with a better state, preferring to view human
					experience, and our minds and environment, as alive and growing. He talks about
					the “ongoing process of organismic experience”&mdash;seeing life as instantaneous and
					ongoing; life exists in the experience of every moment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rogers, a healthy self-concept is not a fixed identity but a fluid and
					changing entity, open to possibilities. Rogers embraces an authentic,
					unprescribed, free-flowing definition of healthy human experience, with
					limitless possibilities. Humans are not traveling a road where the destination
					is to become “adjusted” or “actualized,” as fellow humanistic psychologist
					Abraham Maslow had suggested. Indeed, the purpose of existence is not about
					reaching any kind of destination, Rogers claims, because existence is less a
					journey toward an endpoint and more an ongoing process of growth and discovery
					that does not stop until we die.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"What I will be in the next moment, and what I will do, grows out of the

					characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors displayed by people who have embraced
					the foundations of his approach&mdash;people who are “fully in the stream of life.”
					One essential ingredient is the ability to stay wholly present in the moment.
					Since self and personality emerge out of experience, it is of the utmost
					importance to stay fully open to the possibilities offered by each moment, and
					to let experience shape the self. The individual lives in an environment of
					constant change, yet frequently and all too easily, people deny this fluidity
					and instead create constructs of how they think things should be. They then try
					to mold themselves and their idea of reality to fit the constructs they have
					made. This way of being is the very opposite of the fluid, flowing, and changing
					organization of self that Rogers believes the nature of our existence
					requires.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our preconceptions about how the world is, or should be, and our own role
					within it, define the limits of our world and reduce our ability to stay present
					and open to experience. In living the good life and remaining open to
					experience, Rogers believes we adopt a way of being that prevents us feeling
					trapped and stuck. The aim, as Rogers sees it, is for experience to be the
					starting point for the construction of our personalities, rather than trying to
					fit our experiences into a preconceived notion of our sense of self. If we hold
					on to our ideas of how things should be, rather than accepting how they really
					are, we are likely to perceive our needs as “incongruent” or mismatched to what
					is available.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the world does not “do what we want,” and we feel unable to change our
					ideas, conflict arises in the form of defensiveness. Rogers explains
					defensiveness as the tendency to unconsciously apply strategies to prevent a
					troubling stimulus from entering consciousness. We either deny (block out) or
					distort (reinterpret) what is really happening, essentially refusing to accept
					reality in order to stick with our preconceived ideas. In so doing, we deny
					ourselves the full range of potential reactions, feelings, and ideas, and we
					dismiss a wide range of options as wrong or inappropriate. The defensive
					feelings and thoughts that rise up in us when reality conflicts with our
					preconceptions create a limited, artificial interpretation of experience. In
					order to really participate in what Rogers calls the “ongoing process of
					organismic experience,” we need to be fully open to new experience, and be
					completely without defensiveness.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"Self and personality emerge from experience, rather than experience being

					a deeper, richer experience in every part of our lives. We may think we can
					selectively block emotion, and dampen down disturbing or uncomfortable feelings,
					but when we repress some of our emotions, we inevitably turn down the volume of
					all our emotions, denying ourselves access to the whole of our nature. If on the
					other hand, we allow ourselves to be more comfortable with our emotions,
					including those we have deemed to be negative, the flow of positive feelings
					emerges more strongly; it is as if by permitting ourselves to feel pain, we
					allow for a more intense experience of joy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By always remaining open to everything that occurs, Rogers says that we allow
					our fullest abilities to function, and in turn we can get the greatest
					satisfaction from our experiences. We have not raised our defenses to shut off
					any part of the self, so we are able to experience everything fully. Once we
					escape from the rut of the preconceptions of the mind, we can allow ourselves to
					soar. Rather than organizing our experience to suit our idea of the world, we
					“discover structure <i class="calibre11">in</i> experience.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This openness is not for the faint-hearted, Rogers states; it requires a level
					of bravery on the part of the individual. We don’t need to fear any type of
					feeling, he says&mdash;we need only to allow the full flow of cognition and
					experience. With true access to a fuller range of processing experience, each of
					us is more able to find the path that truly suits our authentic self&mdash;this is the
					fully functioning individual that Rogers urges us to become. We are always
					growing, and Rogers emphasizes that the direction in which people move&mdash;when
					there is freedom to move in any direction&mdash;is generally the direction they are
					best suited for, and that is best suited for them.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-436"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000346.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A fixed view</span> of the world often leads

							it really is.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-437" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Unconditional acceptance</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In contrast to the views of many of his predecessors in the field of
					psychotherapy, Rogers believed that people are, in their essence, healthy and
					good; and that mental and emotional well-being is the natural progression for
					human nature. These beliefs are the foundation of an approach that regards
					patients in an entirely positive light, one of absolute, unconditional
					acceptance. Rogers asked that his patients learn to do the same for themselves
					and for others. This perspective, grounded in compassion and the recognition of
					the potential of each and every individual, is famously termed “unconditional
					positive regard.” Rogers believed that all people, not just his patients, needed
					to be able to view themselves in this way, as well as those around them and
					their environment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconditional self-acceptance and unconditional acceptance of others are
					vital, and when these are lacking, people fail to remain open to experience.
					Rogers maintained that many of us have very strong, strident, specific
					conditions that must be met before we will grant approval or acceptance. We also
					base self-worth and regard for others on achievements or appearance, rather than
					accepting people as they are.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents may inadvertently teach children that they are worthy of affection
					only if certain requirements are met, offering them rewards and praise when they
					eat their vegetables or get an A grade in physics, but fail to love them openly
					just for themselves. Rogers calls these requirements “conditions of worth”,
					believing that the tendency of humankind to demand that people and things match
					our arbitrary expectations does all of us a great disservice.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements are to be respected, he says, but they are both separate and
					secondary to acceptance, which is a basic human need, and does not have to be
					“earned” through deeds or action. Rogers says that the value of an individual is
					inherently granted merely by the miracle of existence. Acceptance must never be
					thought of as conditional; unconditional positive regard is key to how we might
					all live “the good life.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As people become more accepting of themselves, they also become more patient
					with themselves. Acceptance alleviates the pressure to do, see, and acquire,
					which builds when we live with the mistaken idea that these activities define
					our worth. We can begin to realize that each of us is a continual
					work-in-progress; that we are in a process of change, as Rogers says in his
					seminal work, <i class="calibre11">On Becoming A Person</i>&mdash;we are
					all in a constant “state of becoming.” The irony is that with greater
					self-acceptance, and with less unhealthy pressure and constant criticism, we can
					actually become much more productive.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"No other person’s ideas, and none of my own ideas, are as authoritative as
						my experience."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Carl Rogers</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-438"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000300.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Love that is conditional</span> on an action

As
					an individual moves toward openness, he finds that he simultaneously makes
					progress in his ability to trust himself and his instincts, and begins to rely
					more comfortably on his decision-making capabilities. With no need to repress
					any part of himself, he has a greater ability to tune in to all the parts of
					himself. This gives him access to a variety of perspectives and feelings, and in
					turn he is better able to evaluate choices that will truly realize his
					potential. He is able to see more clearly what direction his authentic self
					wishes to take, and can make choices that are truly in congruence with his
					needs. No longer at the mercy of what he thinks he should be doing, nor of what
					society or parents may have conditioned him to think he wants, he can much more
					easily simply exist in the moment and be truly aware of what he actually wants.
					And now he can trust himself, “not because he is infallible, but because he can
					be fully open to the consequences of each of his actions and correct them if
					they prove to be less than satisfying,” Rogers explains.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In living “the good life” we also have a sense of owning our lives and taking
					responsibility for ourselves&mdash;this is another tenet of Rogers’ philosophy and
					comes from an existential viewpoint. What we choose to think or do is down to
					us; there can be no residual resentments when we have truly identified for
					ourselves what we want and need, and taken the steps to create it. At the same
					time, there is greater accountability and an increased tendency to truly invest
					in our lives. It is not uncommon to hear about a doctor who hates medicine but
					practices because his parents said that being a doctor was the way to earn
					respect and approval&mdash;both from them and from society. In direct contrast, the
					rates of students who drop out or fail university courses are strikingly low
					among those who have have received little support but worked to pay for their
					own tuition.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The ways in which people can influence our desires and how we define ourselves
					can be intensely complex. Resentment can be buried deep within us when we act in
					accordance with someone else’s wishes rather than our own. If our actions are
					free of external influences, we feel more authentic, more solidly in control of
					creating our own destiny, and more satisfied with the results.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-440"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000298.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Teaching a child</span> to ride a bicycle

					psychology, which he founded in the 1950s with Abraham Maslow and Rollo May. It
					was based on a positive view of humanity as basically healthy and capable of
					growing and realizing its potential. This approach was in contrast to the other
					main psychological therapies of the time&mdash;psychoanalysis and behaviorism&mdash;both of
					which focus on the pathology of the individual and how to fix it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers initially called his approach “client-centered,” and then changed it to
					“person-centered,” and it has since been hugely influential in education,
					parenting, business, and other areas as well as in clinical work. In
					person-centerd therapy, which Rogers described as “non-directive therapy,” the
					therapist takes the role of a facilitator who helps the client find his or her
					own answers, based on the belief that the client knows himself best. In
					person-centerd therapy, the client identifies his problems and what direction
					the therapy should take. For example, the client may not wish to focus on his
					childhood but rather deal with issues he is facing at work and the therapist may
					help him find what sort of role he would really like to take. Rogers describes
					the process as “supportive, not reconstructive;” the client must not come to
					rely on the therapist for support, but instead needs to learn how to become
					sufficiently self-aware and self-trusting to be independent and able to live
					“the good life.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"The process of the good life… means launching oneself fully into the

					philosophy of the 1960s, which encouraged open communication between
					individuals. He was responsible for the spread of professional counseling into
					areas such as education and social work, and was a pioneer in attempting to
					resolve international conflict through more effective communication.</p></div><div class="section_feature2" id="calibre_link-443"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">CARL ROGERS</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-444"><img alt="" src="images/000271.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Carl Rogers was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to a strictly Protestant family,

					Initially, Rogers majored in agriculture, but after marrying his childhood

					before withdrawing to pursue a course in psychology. Rogers worked at the
					universities of Ohio, Chicago, and Wisconsin, developing his client-centerd
					therapy based on humanistic psychology. He also spent time with the United
					Service Organizations (USO), offering therapy to returning army personnel during
					World War II. In 1964, he was awarded “Humanist of the Year” by the American
					Humanist Association, and devoted the last ten years of his life to working for

				are here, and what the purpose is of our lives. Underlying these questions is a need
				to identify what will make us truly satisfied, and a confusion about how to find it.
				Psychoanalysts would claim that the fulfilment of innate biological drives leads
				toward satisfaction, and behaviorists would describe the importance of meeting
				physiological needs with food, sleep, and sex, but the new wave of psychotherapeutic
				thought in the early to mid-20th century believed that the path to inner fulfillment
				was much more complex.</p><p class="calibre13">One of the main proponents of this new approach to the problem was Abraham Maslow,
				a psychotherapist who is considered one of the founders of the humanist movement in
				psychology. He examined human experience by looking at the things that are most
				important to us: love, hope, faith, spirituality, individuality, and existence. One
				of the most crucial aspects of his theories was that in order to reach the most
				highly developed state of consciousness and realize the greatest potential, an
				individual must discover his true purpose in life and pursue it. Maslow refers to
				this ultimate state of being as self-actualization.</p><div id="calibre_link-447" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Toward self-actualization</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Maslow created a highly structured plan to explain the path of human
					motivation, defining the steps that humans need to follow as they move toward
					self-actualization. His famous Hierarchy of Needs, which is often drawn as a
					pyramid, positions the most basic needs at the base and each of the other
					essential requirements for a fulfilled life in groups on top.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maslow’s hierarchy is split into two distinct sections: at the beginning are
					the four stages that make up the “deficiency needs” and all of these must be met
					before a person is able to reach for greater intellectual satisfaction through
					the “growth needs.” The deficiency needs are simple and basic; they include
					physiological necessities (such as food, water, and sleep), the need for safety
					(to be safe and out of danger), love and belongingness needs (our need to be
					close to and accepted by others), and self-esteem requirements (our need to
					achieve in our lives and be recognized).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the higher level, the growth needs are cognitive (a need to know and
					understand), aesthetic (a desire for order and beauty), and lastly, two
					requirements that define the purpose of life, and lead to intense spiritual and
					psychological fulfillment: self-actualization and self-transcendence.
					Self-actualization is the desire for self-fulfillment, and self-transcendence is
					the need to move beyond the self, and connect to something higher than ourselves&mdash;such as God&mdash;or to help others realize their potential.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Maslow also proposes that each one of us has an individual purpose to which we
					are uniquely suited, and part of the path to fulfillment is to identify and
					pursue that purpose. If someone is not doing what they are best suited to do in
					life, it will not matter if all their other needs are fulfilled, he or she will
					be perpetually restless and unsatisfied. Each of us must discover our potential,
					and seek out experiences that will allow us to fulfil it&mdash;“What a man can be, he
					must be,” proclaims Maslow.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-448"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000220.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</span> lists the

					His parents were Jewish immigrants who had left Russia for the US to escape the

				(</i>1946), written after these experiences, Frankl explains that humans have
				two psychological strengths that allow us to bear painful and possibly devastating

					ourselves a disservice, since we are fighting against processes that lead to
					immense growth and development if we can accept them as a natural part of
					life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;May proposes an approach to life that echoes Buddhist thought, where we accept
					all forms of experience equally, rather than shunning or denying those we judge
					to be uncomfortable or unpleasant. We also need to accept our “negative”
					feelings, rather than avoid or repress them. Suffering and sadness are not
					pathological issues to be “fixed,” he says; they are natural and essential parts
					of living a human life, and are also important because they lead to
					psychological growth.</p></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-67" class="calibre3">Søren Kierkegaard</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-68" class="calibre3">Alfred Adler</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-69" class="calibre3">Carl Rogers</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-70" class="calibre3">Abraham Maslow</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-42" class="calibre3">Viktor Frankl</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-44" class="calibre3">Boris Cyrulnik</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				“men are disturbed not by events, but by the views which they take of them.” This
				principle is the foundation of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), devised by
				Dr. Albert Ellis in 1955, which asserts that experiences do not cause any specific
				emotional reaction; instead it is the individual’s belief system that produces the
				reaction.</p><p class="calibre13">Practicing as a psychoanalyst in the 1940s and 50s, Ellis began to realize that
				while many of his patients gained an insight into themselves and their childhood,
				their symptoms unfortunately remained. It seemed that when one problem was resolved,
				the patient would put another in its place. The issue, Ellis decided, lay in the way
				the person was thinking (their cognition), and it required more than insight to
				change it.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-458"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000302.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-459" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Irrational thinking</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Ellis began to describe his way of working as Rational Therapy because he
					believed that the majority of long-standing emotional problems are almost always
					due to irrational thinking. One of the most common ways in which irrationality
					occurs, he says, is the tendency to draw extreme conclusions, especially
					negative ones, about events. For example, if a man who is an irrational thinker
					loses his job, to him it is not merely unfortunate, but <i class="calibre11">awful</i>. He believes that he is worthless because he was fired,
					and that he will never find another job. Ellis describes irrational beliefs as
					illogical, extreme, damaging, and self-sabotaging because they cause unhealthy
					emotional consequences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rational thinking creates the opposite effect. Ellis defines rational thinking
					as helpful to the self. It is based on tolerance and the ability to bear
					distress without assuming catastrophic negative conclusions, and is rooted in a
					belief in positive human potential. This is not to say one turns a blind eye to
					negative factors in favor of naïve, positive beliefs&mdash;rational thinking does
					acknowledge reasonable feelings of sorrow, guilt, and frustration. The rational
					thinker may lose her job; it may have even been her fault that she lost the job,
					but she knows she is not worthless. She may be upset with herself, but she knows
					that rationally there is the possibility of another job. Rational thinking is
					balanced and always allows room for optimism and possibilities; it creates
					healthy emotional consequences.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis’s notion of irrational thinking is influenced by Karen Horney’s idea of
					the “tyranny of the shoulds”&mdash;a preoccupation with the idea that something should
					(magically) be different from how it is. The struggle to reconcile these
					thoughts with reality is a painful and unending one. Rational thinking, on the
					other hand, focuses on acceptance; it maintains the balanced sense that
					sometimes things happen that we would prefer not to, but they are a part of
					life.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"People and things do not upset us. Rather, we upset ourselves by believing
						that they can upset us."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Albert Ellis</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-460" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Conditioned response</h2></div><p class="calibre14">We become so used to our responses to people and events that they appear to be
					almost automatic; our reaction becomes inextricably linked to the event itself.
					However, Ellis aimed to teach people to recognize how an event may contribute to
					a feeling, but it does not directly cause that feeling. Our emotional response
					depends on the meaning we put on what took place, which in turn is governed by
					rational or irrational thinking.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy examines both the
					emotional response (a cognitive process) and the behavior. The links between
					these two flow in both directions: it is possible to change your thinking
					through changing your behavior, and to change your behavior through changing
					your thinking. Ellis suggests that the way to change one’s thinking involves
					being able to recognize and then dispute irrational beliefs, challenging them
					with rational thoughts.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-461" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Challenging beliefs</h2></div><p class="calibre14">During REBT, an individual is asked to consider whether they have several
					overriding beliefs about themselves and their position in life as these
					contribute to irrational responses. This process is known as “disputing.” For
					instance, some people hold the belief that “I am the only really dependable
					person I know” or “I am destined to be always alone in this world.” In therapy,
					the individual is encouraged to search their personal history to find
					rationalizations for these belief systems. Someone who has been through the
					break-up of several relationships may have the delusion that it is their
					“destiny to be alone” or that they are somehow “unlovable.” REBT encourages
					people to allow for the pain of loss or loneliness, and to logically evaluate
					factors that led to the loss; but discourages the practice of believing that one
					or two instances mean that something will always happen, and therefore being
					happy is impossible.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties inherent in irrational thinking is that it tends to
					perpetuate itself, because in thinking, for instance, “nothing good ever happens
					to me,” there is little or no motivation to seek opportunities where good things
					might happen. The irrational thinker sees the possibilities of having a good
					experience as so unlikely that he gives up searching for them. It also makes him
					blind to the good things that do happen. Many people express the
					self-perpetuating belief: “Yes, I have tried, and <i class="calibre11">I
						know</i> that good things never happen,” which rationalizes and
					reinforces their belief system.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrational thinking is “black and white;” it stops an individual from
					recognizing the full spectrum of possible experiences. If a faulty belief system
					leads us to always interpret situations negatively, then it prevents the
					possibility of alternate positive experiences. Though it often appears that
					“seeing is believing,” the reality is that what we believe is what we
					see.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems

					influenced by our upbringing and culture, we construct our own beliefs and
					reality. As a therapy, it attempts to reveal people’s inflexible and absolutist
					thoughts, feelings, and actions; and helps them see how they are choosing to
					“disturb themselves,” as Ellis puts it. It suggests how to think of and choose
					healthier pathways; and how to internalize and habituate new, more beneficial
					beliefs. In so doing, the therapist becomes obsolete&mdash;once the client grasps the
					idea of becoming self-aware in decision-making, and choosing deliberately (and
					often differently), the therapist is no longer needed.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-464"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000251.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">REBT identifies</span> the patterns of

					psychoanalysis and created the first form of cognitive behavioral therapy, an
					approach that is popular today. He was an active and directive therapist and in
					place of long-term, passive psychoanalysis, he put the work and power squarely
					in the hands of the client&mdash;an approach that prefigured Carl Rogers. He also
					emphasized that theorizing was not enough&mdash;“you have to back it up with action,
					action, action,” he said. REBT became one of the most popular therapies of the
					1970s and 80s, and was highly influential on the work of Aaron Beck, who
					described Ellis as an “explorer, revolutionary, therapist, theorist, and
					teacher.”</p></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-466"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">ALBERT ELLIS</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-467"><img alt="" src="images/000030.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Albert Ellis was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

					psychoanalysis and was influenced by Sigmund Freud, Albert Adler, and Erich
					Fromm. However, his Rational Therapy broke away from psychoanalytic theory and
					is considered to have led the shift toward cognitive behavioral therapy. He is

				functioning family and one that was dysfunctional. She was especially interested in
				the roles that people tend to adopt in order to compensate when healthy dynamics are
				lacking between family members.</p><p class="calibre13">A healthy family life involves open and reciprocated displays of affection, and
				expressions of positive regard and love for one another. More than any previous
				therapist, Satir emphasized the power that compassionate, nurturing relationships
				have in developing well-adjusted psyches.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-470"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000173.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"By knowing how to heal the family, I know how to heal the world."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Virginia Satir</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-471" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Role playing</h2></div><p class="calibre14">When family members lack the ability to openly express emotion and affection,
					Satir suggested that personality “roles” tend to emerge in place of authentic
					identities. She noted five commonly played roles that individual family members
					are likely to adopt, especially in times of stress. These are: the family member
					who constantly finds fault and criticizes (“the blamer”); the non-affectionate
					intellectual (“the computer”); the person who stirs things up in order to shift
					the focus away from emotional issues (“the distractor”); the apologetic
					people-pleaser (“the placator”); and the open, honest, and direct communicator
					(“the leveler”).</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Only levelers maintain a healthy, congruent position, with their inner
					feelings matching their communications with the rest of the family. Others adopt
					their various roles because low self-esteem makes them afraid to show or share
					their true feelings. Placators are afraid of disapproval; blamers attack others
					to hide feelings of unworthiness; computers rely on their intellect to stop them
					acknowledging their feelings; and distracters&mdash;often the youngest in the family&mdash;believe they will only be loved if they are seen as cute and harmless.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;These adopted roles may allow the family to function, but they can overwhelm
					each individual’s ability to be his or her authentic self. Satir believed that
					in order to cast aside these false identities, whether as children or as adults,
					we must accept self-worth as a birthright. Only then will it be possible to
					start moving toward a truly fulfilling existence. This begins with a commitment
					to straightforward, open, and honest communication.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for basic, positive, emotional connections lies at the root of
					Satir’s pioneering work. She believed that love and acceptance are the most
					potent healing forces for any dysfunctional family. By fostering close,
					compassionate relationships with her patients, she mimicked the dynamic she was
					encouraging them to adopt.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-472"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000148.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Five distinct personality roles</span>,

					she wanted to be a “detective of people’s parents” at the age of six. Losing her
					hearing for two years due to an illness helped to make her acutely observant of
					nonverbal communication, and gave her a sensitive insight into human behavior.
					Her father was an alcoholic, and she was well aware of the dynamics of
					caretaking, blaming, and pleasing that went on around her during her own
					childhood.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Satir trained as a teacher, but her interest in problems of self-esteem in
					children led her to take a master’s degree in social work. She set up the first

				different. He felt that society was polluted by politics, and made up of sterile,
				generic communities that do not allow the depth of meaning needed by true
				individuals. The first thing he thought we should do is “Drop Out,” by which he
				meant that we should detach ourselves from artificial attachments and become
				self-reliant in thought and deed. Unfortunately, “Drop Out” has been misinterpreted
				as urging people to halt productivity, which was never his intention.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Leary tells us to “Turn On,” or delve into our unconscious, and “find a
				sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body.” This is a command
				to explore deeper layers of reality, as well as the many levels of experience and
				consciousness. Drugs were one way to do this, and Leary, a Harvard professor, began
				experimenting with the hallucinogenic drug LSD.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;To “Tune In,” Leary asks us to return to society with a new vision, seeking fresh

				belief that to counter emotional pain and change behavior, we need to understand
				where our emotional patterns are rooted. Austrian-American psychologist Paul
				Watzlawick described this process as “insight.” For example, a man who grieves for
				an abnormally long time after his partner leaves him might come to realize that he
				has deep issues with abandonment, because his mother left him when he was a child.
				But a number of therapists have concluded that insight may be unnecessary to counter
				emotional pain, and some, including Watzlawick, have claimed that it can make a
				patient worse.</p><p class="calibre13">Watzlawick famously stated he could not think of a single case in which someone
				changed as a result of a deepening understanding of self. The belief that
				understanding past events helps to shed light on present problems is based on a
				“linear” view of cause and effect. Watzlawick was drawn to the idea of circular
				causality of human behavior, which shows people tend to return to the same actions
				again and again.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Insight, Watzlawick suggested may even cause blindness, both to the real problem
				and its potential solution. He supported the brief therapy approach, which targets

					its focus on mental illness as a biological phenomenon and highlighting the

					personal experience. Although he never denied the grim reality of mental
					illness, his views were in stark contrast to the accepted medical basis and
					practice of psychiatry.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Laing’s work calls into question the validity of psychiatric diagnosis on the
					grounds that the accepted process of diagnosing mental disorders does not follow
					the traditional medical model. Doctors perform examinations and tests to
					diagnose physical illness, whereas psychiatric diagnosis is based on behavior.
					According to Laing, there is also an inherent problem in diagnosing mental
					illness based on conduct, but treating it biologically with drugs. If a
					diagnosis is based on behavior, then so too should be the treatment. He argues
					that drugs also hinder the ability to think, and as a result interfere with the
					natural process of true recovery.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-483"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000192.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Shakespeare’s King Lear</span> is an iconic

					functioning&mdash;and on explaining it to ordinary people. Schizophrenia, he says, is
					not inherited, but is an understandable reaction to unlivable situations. He
					applies social scientist Gregory Bateson’s theory of the “double bind,” in which
					a person is put into situations where he or she faces conflicting expectations,
					and every action leads to negative consequences, resulting in extreme mental
					distress.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-485" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Illness as breakthrough</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Laing was revolutionary in viewing the abnormal behavior and confused speech
					of schizophrenics as valid expressions of distress. For him, psychotic episodes
					represent attempts to communicate concerns, and should be seen as cathartic and
					transformative experiences that could lead to important personal insights. Laing
					accepts that these expressions are difficult to comprehend, but he explains that
					this is merely because they are wrapped in the language of personal symbolism,
					which is only meaningful from within. Laing’s drug-free psychotherapy tries to
					make sense of a patient’s symbolism by listening in an attentive and empathetic
					spirit. This is based on the belief that people are healthy in their natural
					state, and that so-called mental illness is an attempt to return to it.</p></div><div class="section_feature5" id="calibre_link-486"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">R.D.

				their coping mechanisms, they fall into deep depression or despondency, sometimes
				losing hope and even the will to carry on. They may become entirely preoccupied with
				the disaster and suffer nightmares, flashbacks, and anxiety attacks. Other people,
				however, react differently. They seem to manage not only the normal ups and downs of
				their lives, but also potentially overwhelming losses and traumas. Instead of
				becoming depressed and unable to cope, somehow they are able to deal with painful
				circumstances and move on.</p><p class="calibre13">Boris Cyrulnik is interested in this difference of reaction. To find out why some
				people are so deeply affected, while others are seemingly able to “bounce back,” he
				has devoted his career to the study of psychological resilience.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Resilience is not a quality inherent within a person, Cyrulnik found, but one that
				builds through a natural process. He says that “alone, a child has no resilience… it
				is an interaction, a relationship.” We build resilience from developing
				relationships. We are constantly “knitting” ourselves from people and situations
				that we encounter, through the words we exchange and the feelings that arise. We
				might feel that if one “stitch” is dropped, our lives will unravel. In fact, “if
				just one stitch holds, we can start all over again.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive emotions and humor are key factors in resilience. Cyrulnik’s research has
				shown that people who are better able to cope with life’s difficulties or traumas
				are able to find meaning in hardship, seeing it as a useful and enlightening
				experience, and even to find ways to laugh. Resilient people always remain able to
				see how things may turn out for the better in future, even if the present is

					emotional in general, but Cyrulnik believed that the pain is no less for
					resilient people than it is for others; it is a matter of how they choose to use
					it. The pain may continue, even over a whole lifetime, but for these people it
					raises a challenge that they decide to meet. The challenge is to overcome what
					has happened, to find strength in the experience instead of letting it defeat
					them, and to use the strength to move defiantly forward. Given the right
					support, children are especially capable of complete recovery from trauma.
					Cyrulnik has shown that the human brain is malleable and will recover if
					allowed. The brain of a traumatized child shows shrinkage of the ventricles and
					cortex, but where the child is well supported and loved after the trauma, brain
					scans have shown the brain to be capable of returning to normal within a
					year.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrulnik stresses the importance of not labeling children who have suffered a
					trauma, thereby sidelining them to a seemingly hopeless future. Trauma consists
					of the injury and the representation of that injury. Enduring humiliating adult
					interpretations of events can be the most traumatic experience. Labels, he says,
					can be more damaging and damning than the experience.</p></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-493"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">BORIS CYRULNIK</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-494"><img alt="" src="images/000280.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Boris Cyrulnik was born to Jewish parents in Bordeaux, France, shortly before

					his parents were taken to Auschwitz concentration camp. His parents had placed
					him with a foster family for safety, but within days they turned him over to the
					authorities for a small reward. He escaped while awaiting transfer to a
					concentration camp and worked on farms until the age of ten, when he was taken
					into care. He grew up in France, without any relatives. Largely self-taught,
					Cyrulnik eventually studied medicine at the University of Paris. Realizing he
					wanted to reevaluate his own life, he began to study psychoanalysis and later
					neuropsychiatry. He has devoted his career to working with traumatized

				thinking in psychology: behaviorism (which concentrated on learning theory) and
				psychoanalysis (which focused on the unconscious and development in early
				childhood). The mental processes that had preoccupied psychologists in the previous
				century, such as perception, consciousness, and memory, were largely
				neglected.</p><p class="calibre13">There were inevitably some exceptions. Psychologists Frederic Bartlett of the UK
				and Bluma Zeigarnik of Russia were both studying the process of memory in the 1920s
				and 30s, anticipating the work of later cognitive psychologists. In Germany,
				Wolfgang Köhler’s work on problem-solving and decision-making drew on Gestalt
				psychology&mdash;a German school of thought that concentrated on perception and perceptual
				organization&mdash;and was also a precursor of cognitive psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-501"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000093.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-502" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The cognitive revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre14">What eventually swung the balance from interest in behavior to the study of
					mental processes came from outside psychology. Improvements in communications
					and computer technology, and possibilities opened up by artificial intelligence&mdash;then a growing field thanks to advances made during World War II&mdash;led to a new
					way of thinking about the brain: as an information processor. The mental
					processes, referred to as “cognitive processes” or “cognition,” which
					behaviorism would not or could not examine, now had a model for psychologists to
					work from. At the same time, advances in neuroscience led to a greater
					understanding of the functions of the brain and nervous system. This allowed
					psychologists, notably Donald Hebb, to examine mental processes directly, rather
					than merely inferring them from observations of behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first to apply the information-processing analogy to psychology was
					a student of Frederic Bartlett’s at Cambridge, Donald Broadbent, who had been
					inspired by the work of computer scientist Alan Turing and communications expert
					Colin Cherry in the 1940s and 50s. But the turning point came in the US, where
					behaviorism began to be criticized for its limitations, leading to a so-called
					“cognitive revolution” in the late 1950s. In the vanguard of this dramatic shift
					of approach were the Americans George Armitage Miller and Jerome Bruner, who in
					1960 co-founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-503" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">A new direction</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Miller and Bruner’s ground-breaking work led to a fundamental change of
					direction in psychology. Areas that had been neglected by behaviorists, such as
					memory, perception, and emotions, became the central focus. While Bruner
					incorporated the concepts of cognition into existing theories of learning and
					developmental psychology, Miller’s application of the information-processing
					model to memory opened up the field, making memory an important area of study
					for cognitive psychologists, including Endel Tulving, Elizabeth Loftus, Daniel
					Schacter, and Gordon H. Bower. There was also a reappraisal of Gestalt
					psychology: Roger Shepard reexamined ideas of perception, and Wolfgang Köhler’s
					work on problem-solving and decision-making resurfaced in the theories of Daniel
					Kahneman and Amos Tversky. And, perhaps for the first time, cognitive
					psychologists, including Bower and Paul Ekman, made a scientific study of
					emotion.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn’t only the theories of behaviorists that were overturned; Freud’s
					psychoanalytic theory and its followers were also criticized for being
					unscientific. Aaron Beck found that cognitive psychology could provide a more
					effective therapy&mdash;and that it was more amenable to objective scrutiny. The
					cognitive therapy he advocated, later incorporating elements of behavioral
					therapy and meditation techniques, soon became standard treatment for disorders
					such as depression and anxiety, and led to a movement of positive psychology
					advocating mental wellbeing rather than just treating mental illness.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the 21st century, cognitive psychology is still the
					dominant approach to the subject, and has had an effect on neuroscience,
					education, and economics. It has even influenced the nature&ndash;nurture
					debate; in the light of recent discoveries in genetics and neuroscience,
					evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker have argued that our thoughts
					and actions are determined by the make-up of our brains, and that they are like
					other inherited characteristics: subject to the laws of natural
					selection.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

					with a problem, such as how to reach food in an inaccessible place, the
					chimpanzees were frustrated in their initial attempts, but would then pause and
					apparently take stock of the situation before attempting some kind of solution.
					This often involved using tools&mdash;such as sticks or crates that were lying around
					in their play area&mdash;to reach the food. When subsequently faced with the same
					problem, they instantly applied the same solution. Köhler concluded that the
					chimps’ behavior showed a cognitive trial-and-error process rather than an
					actual one; they were solving the problem in their minds first, and only after
					an insight (the “aha” moment) tried out their solution. This is contrary to the
					behaviorist view that learning is conditioned by response to a stimulus, and
					reinforced by reward. The chimps learned by perceiving the problem, not by
					receiving rewards.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a demonstration of Köhler’s dynamic model of behavior, involving
					organization within perception, rather than passive learning through response to
					rewards. The pattern (Gestalt) of learning by insight&mdash;failure, pause,
					perception, insight, and attempt&mdash;is an active one; but this is not necessarily
					apparent to someone watching the chimps’ separate attempts to solve the problem,
					mainly because it is not possible to see the organization of perception in the
					chimp’s mind. What we call instinct, the apparently automatic response to
					solving a problem, is affected by this process of insight learning, and is
					itself an active, dynamic pattern.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-508"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000078.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Köhler studied chimpanzees</span> solving

				Bluma Zeigarnik was told by her professor, Kurt Lewin, that he had noticed waiters
				could recall details of orders that were still not paid for better than details of
				orders they had completed. This led Zeigarnik to wonder whether unfinished tasks
				have a different status in memory, and are remembered better, than finished ones.
				She devised an experiment in which participants were given simple puzzles or tasks
				to do. They were interrupted during about half these tasks. Later, when asked how
				well they could remember the activities, it became clear that they were twice as
				likely to recall details of the interrupted tasks, whether these were ultimately
				completed or not. Zeigarnik reasoned that this could be due to the task lacking
				closure, leading to the memory being stored differently, and more
				effectively.</p><p class="calibre13">This phenomenon, which became known as the “Zeigarnik effect,” had important
				implications. Zeigarnik proposed that students, especially children, retained more
				if they had frequent breaks while studying. But little notice was taken of her ideas
				until memory once again became a key subject for research in the 1950s. Since then,
				Zeigarnik’s theory has been accepted as a major step in the understanding of memory,

				answers to questions about learning and memory. Prominent among these was Karl
				Lashley, who led the way in examining the role played by neural connections, but it
				was his student, the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb, who formulated a theory to
				explain what actually happens during the process of associative learning.</p><p class="calibre13">Hebb argued that nerve cells become associated when they are simultaneously and
				repeatedly active; the synapses, or links, that connect them become stronger.
				Repeated experiences lead to the formation of “cell assemblies,” or groups of
				connected neurons, in the brain&mdash;a theory often summed up as “cells that fire
				together, wire together.” Similarly, separate cell assemblies can also become
				linked, forming a “phase sequence,” which we recognize as a thought process.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;This associative process, Hebb found, is especially noticeable in childhood
				learning, when new cell assemblies and phase sequences are being formed. In his
				book, <i class="calibre11">The Organization of Behavior</i> (1949), he
				gave the example of a baby hearing footsteps, which stimulates a number of neurons
				in its brain; if the experience is repeated, a cell assembly forms. Subsequently,
				“when the baby hears footsteps…an assembly is excited; while this is still active he
				sees a face and feels hands picking him up, which excites other assemblies&mdash;so the
				‘footsteps assembly’ becomes connected with the ‘face assembly’ and with the
				‘being-picked-up assembly’. After this has happened, when the baby hears footsteps
				only, all three assemblies are excited.” In adults, however, learning tends to
				involve the rearrangement of existing cell assemblies and phase sequences, rather
				than the formation of new ones.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebb’s theory of cell assembly was a cornerstone of modern neuroscience, and his
				explanation of neural learning, which became known as Hebbian learning, remains the
				accepted model.</p><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-30" class="calibre3">Edward Thorndike</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-103" class="calibre3">Karl Lashley</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-17" class="calibre3">Wolfgang Köhler</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-11" class="calibre3">George Armitage Miller</a> • <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="calibre3">Daniel Schacter</a></b></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				of the 20th century by Jean Piaget, who explained how a child’s thinking develops
				and matures in stages, as a result of a natural curiosity to explore the
				environment. Lev Vygotsky’s theory, which appeared in English shortly after
				Piaget’s, also claimed that a child finds meaning through experience, but widened
				the meaning of the word “experience” to encompass cultural and social experience.
				Children, he said, learn mainly through interaction with other people.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-518"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000187.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre13">At this point in the 1960s, the “cognitive revolution” was gaining momentum;
				mental processes were increasingly being explained by the analogy of the brain as an
				“information processor.” Jerome Bruner was a key figure in this new approach, having
				previously studied the ways that our needs and motivations influence perception&mdash;and
				concluding that we see what we need to see. He became interested in how cognition
				develops, and so began to study cognitive processes in children.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-519"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000061.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A spiral curriculum</span> would work best in

					Vygotsky’s ideas, shifting the emphasis in the study of cognitive development
					from the construction of meaning to the processing of information: the means by
					which we acquire and store knowledge. Like Piaget, he believes that acquiring
					knowledge is an experiential process; but like Vygotsky, sees this as a social
					occupation, not a solitary one. He maintains that learning cannot be conducted
					unassisted: some form of instruction is essential to a child’s development, but
					“to instruct someone… is not a matter of getting him to commit results to mind.
					Rather, it is to teach him to participate in the process.” When we acquire
					knowledge, we need to actively participate and reason, rather than passively
					absorb information, because this is what gives knowledge meaning. In terms of
					cognitive psychology, reasoning is seen as “processing information,” so the
					acquisition of knowledge should be seen as a process, not a product or end
					result. We need encouragement and guidance in that process, and for Bruner, that
					is the role of a teacher.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i class="calibre11">The Process of Education</i> (1960), Bruner
					presented the idea that children should be active participants in the process of
					education. The book became a landmark text, altering educational policy in the

				Originally attracted by Lewin’s work in Gestalt psychology, he later took an
				interest in social psychology. In the course of his research, Festinger observed
				that people continually seek to bring order to their world, and a key part of that
				order is consistency. To achieve this, they develop routines and habits, such as
				establishing regular mealtimes and choosing favorite seats on their daily commute to
				work. When these routines are disrupted, people feel very uneasy. The same is true,
				he found, of habitual thought patterns or beliefs. If a very strong opinion is met
				with contradictory evidence, it creates an uncomfortable internal inconsistency;
				Festinger called this “cognitive dissonance.” He reasoned that the only way to
				overcome this discomfort is to somehow make the belief and the evidence
				consistent.</p><div id="calibre_link-526" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Unshakeable conviction</h2></div><p class="calibre14">After reading a report in a local newspaper in 1954, Festinger saw an
					opportunity to study the reaction to just such a cognitive dissonance. A cult
					claimed to have received messages from aliens warning of a flood that would end
					the world on December 21; only true believers would be rescued by flying
					saucers. Festinger and some of his colleagues at the University of Minnesota
					gained access to the group, interviewing them before the designated apocalyptic
					date and again afterward, when the events had failed to transpire.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The now-famous Oak Park study of this group, written up by Festinger, Henry
					Riecken, and Stanley Schachter in <i class="calibre11">When Prophecy
						Fails</i>, describes the reaction of the cult members. Where common
					sense might lead us to expect that the failure of their prediction and
					consequent cognitive dissonance would cause cult members to abandon their
					beliefs, the opposite occurred. As the day of reckoning drew near, another
					“message” came through, declaring that, due to the group’s dedication, the world
					was to be spared. Cult members became even more fervent believers. Festinger had
					anticipated this; to accept the contradictory evidence would set up an even
					greater dissonance between past belief and present denial, he argued. This
					effect was compounded if a great deal (reputation, jobs, and money) had been
					invested in the original belief.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Festinger concluded that cognitive dissonance, or at least the avoidance of
					it, makes a man of strong conviction unlikely to change his opinion in the face
					of contradiction; he is immune to evidence and rational argument. As Festinger
					explains: “Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures
					and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your
					point.”</p></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-527"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">LEON FESTINGER</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-528"><img alt="" src="images/000375.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Leon Festinger was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Russian immigrant family.

					capacity” (the amount of information that can be processed by a system) and
					applied it to the model of short-term memory as an information processor. This
					was when he began to be “persecuted” by the recurrence and possible significance
					of the number seven; “sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller
					than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first instance of the “magical” number came from experiments to determine
					the span of absolute judgment&mdash;how accurately we can distinguish a number of
					different stimuli. In one experiment cited in Miller’s paper, the physicist and
					acoustic specialist Irwin Pollack played a number of different musical tones to
					participants, who were then asked to assign a number to each tone. When up to
					around seven different tones were played, the subjects had no difficulty in
					accurately assigning numbers to each of them, but above seven (give or take one
					or two), the results deteriorated dramatically.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In another experiment, by Kaufman, Lord, <i class="calibre11">et
						al</i>, in 1949, researchers flashed varying numbers of colored dots
					on to a screen in front of participants. When there were fewer than seven dots,
					participants could accurately number them; when there were more than seven,
					participants were only able to estimate the number of dots. This suggests that
					the span of attention is limited to around six, and caused Miller to wonder
					whether the same basic process might be involved in both the span of absolute
					judgment and the span of attention.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The tones and dots in these experiments are what Miller calls “unidimensional
					stimuli” (objects that differ from one another in only one respect); but what
					interested Miller is the amount of information in speech and language we can
					effectively process, and items such as words are “multidimensional stimuli.” He
					looks to later studies by Pollack in which the simple tones were replaced by
					tones that varied in six ways (such as pitch, duration, volume, and location).
					Surprisingly, despite the apparently larger amount of information, the results
					still pointed to a differential limit of seven, plus or minus two. The
					difference is that as more variables are added, accuracy slightly decreases.
					Miller claims this allows us to make “relatively crude judgments of several
					things simultaneously.” It may explain how we are able to recognize and
					distinguish such complex things as spoken words and people’s faces, without
					having to process the individual sounds or features.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller sees the human mind as a communication system: as the input information
					increases, the amount transmitted to the brain also increases initially, before
					leveling off at an individual’s “channel capacity.” Miller then took this idea
					of channel capacity a stage further, applying it to the model of short-term
					memory. William James first proposed the notion of short-term memory, and it had
					long been an accepted part of the model of the brain as an information
					processor, coming between the sensory input of information and long-term memory.
					Hermann Ebbinghaus and Wilhelm Wundt had even suggested that short-term memory
					had a capacity limited to around seven items (seven, again). Miller believed
					that what he called working memory had a capacity that corresponded to the
					limits of absolute judgment and span of attention.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-533"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000126.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">An experiment into the span of

					to about seven elements, there is a potential bottleneck restricting the amount
					that can be put into long-term memory. But Miller suggested that there was more
					to the correspondence than just the number seven, no matter how magical it
					appeared. The multidimensional stimuli of previous experiments could be seen as
					composed of several “bits” of related information, but treated as a single item.
					Miller believed that by the same principle, working memory organizes “bits” of
					information into “chunks,” to overcome the informational bottleneck caused by
					our limited spans of absolute judgment and short-term memory. A chunk is not,
					however, just an arbitrary grouping, but an encoding of bits into a meaningful
					unit; for example, a string of 21 letters represents 21 bits of information, but
					if this can be broken down into a sequence of three-letter words, it becomes
					seven chunks. Chunking is dependent on our ability to find patterns and
					relationships in the bits of information. To someone who does not speak the same
					language, the seven words might be meaningless, and would not constitute seven
					chunks, but 21 bits.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller’s theory was backed up by earlier experiments by other psychologists.
					In 1954, Sidney Smith conducted experiments in memorizing a sequence of binary
					digits&mdash;a meaningless string of ones and zeroes to anyone unfamiliar with the
					binary system. Smith broke the series down into chunks, at first into pairs of
					digits, and then in groups of three, four, and five, and then “recoded” them by
					translating the binary chunks into decimal numbers: 01 became 1, 10 became 2,
					and so on. He found that by using this system it was possible to memorize and
					accurately reproduce a string of 40 digits or more, as long as the number of
					chunks was limited to the span of working memory.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aid to memorizing large amounts of information, chunking and recoding is
					an obvious boon, but it is more than a mnemonic trick. Miller pointed out that
					this form of recoding is an “extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount
					of information we can deal with.” It effectively stretches the informational
					bottleneck.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-535"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000285.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Miller’s theory of chunking</span> says that

					but his theory prompted others to examine it in more detail. Donald Broadbent
					argued that the real figure for working memory is probably less than seven, and
					this was later confirmed in experiments by Nelson Cowan, who found it to be
					around four chunks, depending on the length and complexity of the chunks, and
					the age of the subject.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conclusion to his paper, Miller is dismissive of the significance of
					the number that originally prompted it. He concludes by saying: “Perhaps there
					is something deep and profound behind all these sevens… but I suspect that it is
					only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.”</p></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-538"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">GEORGE ARMITAGE MILLER</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-539"><img alt="" src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">George Armitage Miller was born in Charleston, WV.

				from Ivan Pavlov’s experiments, and which was enthusiastically championed in
				the US; and clinical psychology, which was largely based on the psychoanalytical
				approach of Sigmund Freud and his followers. The two had little in common.
				Behaviorists rejected the introspective, philosophical approach of earlier
				psychologists, and strove to put the subject on a more scientific,
				evidence-based footing. The psychoanalysts explored those very
				introspections, with theories, rather than proof, to support their case.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-542"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000189.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-543" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cognitive revolution</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By the mid-20th century, both approaches to psychology were being critically
					examined. But although behaviorism was being overtaken by cognitive psychology
					in experimental work, the clinical sphere was offering no alternative to the
					psychoanalytical model. Psychotherapy had evolved into many forms, but the basic
					idea of psychoanalysis and exploration of the unconscious was common to all of
					them. Some psychologists were beginning to question the validity of this kind of
					therapy, and Aaron Beck was among them.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"I concluded that psychoanalysis was a faith-based therapy."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aaron Beck</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">When Beck qualified as a psychiatrist in 1953, experimental psychology was
					focused on the study of mental processes&mdash;it was the dawn of the “cognitive
					revolution.” However, the practical approach of cognitive psychologists remained
					much the same as that of the behaviorists. If anything, they were frequently
					even more rigorous in establishing evidence for their theories. Beck was no
					exception to this. He had trained in and practiced psychoanalysis, but grew
					skeptical of its effectiveness as a therapy. He could find no reliable studies
					of the success rates of psychoanalysis&mdash;only anecdotal evidence of case reports.
					In his experience, only a minority of patients showed improvement under
					analysis, and the general consensus among therapists was that some got better,
					some got worse, and some stayed about the same, in almost equal numbers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of particular concern was the resistance of many psychoanalysts to objective
					scientific examination. Compared with experimental psychology, or with medicine,
					psychoanalysis seemed largely faith-based, with widely different results between
					individual practitioners. Reputation was frequently based solely on the charisma
					of a particular analyst. Beck concluded that “the psychoanalytic mystique was
					overwhelming… It was a little bit like the evangelical movement.” Many
					psychoanalysts regarded criticism of their theories as a personal attack, and
					Beck soon discovered that any questioning of the validity of psychoanalysis was
					likely to be countered with universal denouncement. At one time, he was turned
					down for membership of the American Psychoanalytic Institute on the grounds that
					his “desire to conduct scientific studies signaled that he’d been improperly
					analysed.” Those who found fault with the idea of analysis did so, some analysts
					argued, because of insufficient analysis of themselves.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck was suspicious of both the circularity of these arguments, and the link
					with the therapist’s own personality. Coupled with his personal experience as a
					practicing psychoanalyst, this led him to examine thoroughly every aspect of
					therapy, looking for ways in which it could be improved. He carried out a series
					of experiments designed to evaluate the basis and treatment of depression, one
					of the most common reasons for seeking psychotherapy, and found that far from
					confirming the idea that this condition could be treated by examination of
					unconscious emotions and drives, his results pointed to a very different
					interpretation.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-544" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Changing perceptions</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In describing their depression, Beck’s patients often expressed negative ideas
					about themselves, their future, and society in general, which came to them
					involuntarily. These “automatic thoughts,” as Beck called them, led him to
					conclude that the way the patients perceived their experiences&mdash;their cognition
					of them&mdash;was not just a symptom of their depression, but also the key to finding
					an effective therapy. This idea, which came to him in the 1960s, chimed with
					concurrent developments in experimental psychology, which had established the
					dominance of cognitive psychology by studying mental processes such as
					perception.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;When Beck applied a cognitive model to treatment, he found that helping his
					patients to recognize and evaluate how realistic or distorted their perceptions
					were was the first step in overcoming depression. This flew in the face of
					conventional psychoanalysis, which sought and examined underlying drives,
					emotions, and repressions. Beck’s “cognitive therapy” saw this as unnecessary or
					even counterproductive. The patient’s perception could be taken at face value
					because, as he was fond of putting it, “there’s more to the surface than meets
					the eye.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"By correcting erroneous beliefs, we can lower excessive reactions."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aaron Beck</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">What Beck meant by this was that the immediate manifestations of depression&mdash;the negative “automatic thoughts”&mdash;provide all the information needed for
					therapy. If these thoughts are examined and compared with an objective, rational
					view of the same situation, the patient can recognize how his perception is
					distorted. For example, a patient who has been offered a promotion at work might
					express negative thoughts such as “I’ll find the new job too difficult, and
					fail,” a perception of the situation that leads to anxiety and unhappiness. A
					more rational way of looking at the promotion would be to see it as a reward, or
					even a challenge. It is not the situation that is causing the depression, but
					the patient’s perception of it. Cognitive therapy could help him to recognize
					how distorted it is, and find a more realistic and positive way of thinking
					about the situation.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-545"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000392.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A distorting mirror</span> creates a view of

					more, he was able to demonstrate that it worked, as he applied scientific
					methods to ensure that he had empirical evidence for his findings. He designed
					special assessments for his patients, so that he could monitor their progress
					closely. The results showed that cognitive therapy was making his patients feel
					better, and feel better more quickly, than was the case under traditional
					psychoanalysis. Beck’s insistence on providing evidence for any claims he made
					for his therapy opened it up to objective scrutiny. Above all, he was most
					anxious to avoid acquiring the guru-like status of many successful
					psychoanalysts, and was at great pains to demonstrate that it was the therapy
					that was successful, and not the therapist.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck was not the only, or even the first, psychologist to find traditional
					psychoanalysis unsatisfactory, but his use of a cognitive model was innovatory.
					He had been influenced in his reaction against psychoanalysis by the work of
					Albert Ellis, who had developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) in the
					mid-1950s, and he was no doubt aware of the work of behaviorists elsewhere in
					the world, including the South Africans Joseph Wolpe and Arnold A. Lazarus.
					Although different in approach, their therapies shared with Beck’s a thoroughly
					scientific methodology and a rejection of the importance of unconscious causes
					of mental and emotional disorders.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Don’t trust me, test me."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Aaron Beck</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Once the success of cognitive therapy had been established, it was used
					increasingly for treating depression, and later Beck found that it could also be
					helpful for other conditions, such as personality disorders and even
					schizophrenia. Always open to new ideas&mdash;as long as it could be shown that they
					were effective&mdash;Beck also incorporated elements of behavior therapy into his
					treatments, as did many other psychotherapists in the 1980s. This has resulted
					in the varied forms of cognitive behavioral therapy that are used by
					psychologists today.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck’s pioneering work marked a turning point for psychotherapy, and his
					influence is considerable. As well as bringing a cognitive approach into
					clinical psychology, Beck subjected it to scientific scrutiny, exposing the
					weaknesses of psychoanalysis. In the process, he introduced several methods for
					assessing the nature and severity of depression that are still used: the Beck
					Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Beck Scale for
					Suicidal Ideation (BSS), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-547"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000347.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">How people assess</span> the same situation

					thoroughgoing scientist, and England’s first professor of experimental
					psychology. Bartlett believed that the most important theoretical discoveries
					are often made while attempting to find solutions to practical problems. This
					idea appealed to Broadbent, and prompted him to continue working under Bartlett
					at the new Applied Psychology Unit (APU) after it opened in 1944. It was during
					his time there that Broadbent was to do his most groundbreaking work. He chose
					to ignore the then-dominant behaviorist approach to psychology and to
					concentrate on the practical problems he had come across in his time in the RAF.
					For example, pilots sometimes confused similar-looking controls; in some planes,
					the lever for pulling up the wheels was identical to the one for pulling up the
					flaps, and the two were situated together under the seat; this led to frequent
					accidents. Broadbent thought these incidents could be avoided if the capacities
					and limitations of the pilots were taken into consideration during the design
					process, rather than surfacing at the point of use.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"The test of a psychological theory, as well as its moral justification,
						lies in its application to concrete practical considerations."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Donald Broadbent</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Broadbent was interested in using psychology not only to design better
					equipment, but also to reach a better understanding of what affected the
					pilots’ capabilities. They clearly had to cope with large amounts of
					incoming information, and then had to select the relevant data they needed to
					make good decisions. It seemed to him that mistakes were often made when there
					were too many sources of incoming information.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadbent was influenced in his thinking about how we process information by
					another product of wartime research: the development of computers and the idea
					of “artificial intelligence.” The first director of the APU, Kenneth Craik, had
					left the unit important manuscripts and flow diagrams comparing human and
					artificial information processing, which Broadbent clearly studied.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"His psychology was intended for society and its problems, not merely for
						the dwellers in ivory towers."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Fergus Craik and Alan Baddely</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">At the same time, code breakers such as the mathematician Alan Turing had been
					tackling the notion of information processing, and in the postwar period he
					applied this to the idea of a “thinking machine.” The comparison of a machine to
					the workings of the brain was a powerful analogy, but it was Broadbent who
					turned the idea around, considering the human brain as a kind of
					information-processing machine. This, in essence, is what distinguishes
					cognitive psychology from behaviorism: it is the study of mental processes,
					rather than their manifestation in behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To study how our attention works, Broadbent needed to design experiments that
					would back up his hunches. His background in engineering meant that he would not
					be satisfied until he had evidence on which to base a theory, and he also wanted
					that research to have a practical application. The APU was dedicated to applied
					psychology, which for Broadbent referred not only to therapeutic applications,
					but also to applications that benefited society as a whole; he was always very
					conscious that his research was publicly funded.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-555" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">One voice at a time</h2></div><p class="calibre14">One of Broadbent’s most important experiments was suggested by his experience
					with air traffic control. Ground crew often had to deal with several streams of
					incoming information simultaneously, sent from planes arriving and departing,
					which was relayed to the operators by radio and received through headphones. The
					air traffic controllers then had to make quick decisions based on that
					information, and Broadbent had noticed that they could only effectively deal
					with one message at a time. What interested him was the mental process that must
					take place in order for them to select the most important message from the
					various sources of incoming information. He felt that there must be some kind of
					mechanism in the brain that processes the information and makes that
					selection.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment that Broadbent devised, now known as the dichotic listening
					experiment, was one of the first in the field of selective attention&mdash;the process
					our brains use to “filter out” the irrelevant information from the masses of
					data we receive through our senses all the time. Following the air traffic
					control model, he chose to present aural (sound-based) information through
					headphones to the subjects of his experiment. The system was set up so that he
					could relay two different streams of information at the same time&mdash;one to the
					left ear and one to the right&mdash;and then test the subjects on their retention of
					that information.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As Broadbent had suspected, the subjects were unable to reproduce all the
					information from both channels of input. His feeling that we can only listen to
					one voice at once had been confirmed, but still the question remained as to
					exactly how the subject had chosen to retain some of the incoming information
					and effectively disregard the rest.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking back to his initial training as an engineer, Broadbent suggested a
					mechanical model to explain what he felt was happening in the brain. He believed
					that when there are multiple sources of input, they may reach a “bottleneck” if
					the brain is unable to continue to process all the incoming information; at this
					point, there must be some kind of “filter” that lets through only one channel of
					input. The analogy he uses to explain this is typically practical: he describes
					a Y-shaped tube, into which two flows of ping pong balls are channeled. At the
					junction of the two branches of the tube, there is a flap that acts to block one
					flow of balls or the other; this allows balls from the unblocked channel into
					the stem of the tube.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A question still remained, however: at what stage does this filter come into
					operation? In a series of experiments that were variations on his original
					dichotic listening tasks, Broadbent established that information is received by
					the senses and then passed on in its entirety to some kind of store, which he
					called the short-term memory store. It is at this stage, he believes, that the
					filtering occurs. His description of how and when information is selected for
					attention is known as the “Broadbent Filter Model,” and it demonstrated a
					completely new approach to experimental psychology, not only in combining the
					theoretical with the practical, but also in considering the workings of the
					brain as a form of information processing.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-556"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000125.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Air traffic controllers</span> have to deal

					attention. Another British scientist, Colin Cherry, also investigated the
					subject during the 1950s. Working in communication rather than psychology,
					Cherry posed what he called the “cocktail party problem:” how, at a party where
					lots of people are talking, do we select which of many conversations to give our
					attention to, and which to ignore? And how is it possible to be distracted from
					our focused attention on conversation “A” by conversations “B” or “C”?</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To help answer these questions, Broadbent turned his attention to the nature
					of the filter in his model. Precisely what information does it filter out, and
					what does it allow through? Following another process of rigorous experimenting,
					he found that the selection is made not on the content of the information (what
					is being said), but on the physical characteristics of any message, such as
					clarity or tone of voice. This suggests that even though information is stored,
					albeit very briefly, in short-term memory, it is only after filtering that it is
					processed for meaning and actually understood. This finding had important
					implications when applied to air traffic control, for example, where decisions
					could be made on possibly irrelevant or inaccurate information, rather than
					being prioritized according to meaning and importance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadbent and Cherry worked together on many dichotic listening experiments to
					test the filtering process. They realized that filtering is also affected by
					expectation. In one experiment, participants were asked to listen to different
					sets of numbers presented simultaneously to each ear. In some cases they were
					instructed which ear (the information channel) they would be asked about first;
					in others no instructions were given. The results showed that when people know
					which ear is receiving the stream of information they will be asked for first,
					they switch attention to that ear, and the information that enters the other ear
					is not always accurately retrieved from memory. In all cases the information
					that people chose or were asked to remember first seemed to be processed more
					accurately than the later material; it was thought this might be due to parts of
					the information being lost from the short-term memory store before the
					participant tried to retrieve it. In 1957, Broadbent wrote: “We can listen to
					only one voice at once, and the first words we hear are the best
					recalled.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-559"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000286.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">People at a cocktail party</span> may be

					outlined a framework for studying attention, comprehension, and memory. The
					timing was significant, as it coincided with a divergence of opinion about the
					importance of behaviorism in the US, and the book slowly became known as one of
					the landmarks in the development of the new cognitive psychology. As a result,
					Broadbent was recognized, by his peers if not the public, as the first major
					psychologist Britain had produced, and was rewarded the same year by being
					appointed director of the APU to succeed Bartlett.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one to rest on his laurels, however, Broadbent saw his new appointment as
					an opportunity to continue his work on attention, widening the scope of his
					research and refining the theory. From the starting point of his filter model,
					he returned to the cocktail party problem, and in particular one phenomenon
					Cherry had identified concerning the nature of information that is selected for
					attention. When an overheard conversation includes information that has some
					kind of special significance for a person&mdash;such as a personal name&mdash;the attention
					is switched toward that conversation, and away from the one previously attended
					to.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Further dichotic listening experiments at the APU bore out Cherry’s findings:
					attention is filtered by physical characteristics but also by meaning, using
					feedback from memory stores, prior experience, and expectations. The sound of a
					siren, for instance, would divert attention on to that stream of sound. This
					suggests that information is in some way understood before being selected for
					attention.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadbent realized that his filter model needed modification, but was pleased
					rather than dismayed to have to make the changes. As a scientist, he felt that
					all scientific theories are temporary, derived from the evidence available at
					the time, and so susceptible to change in the light of new evidence; this is how
					science progresses.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the APU centerd around Broadbent’s research into attention, but
					this allowed for a constantly widening range of applications. Broadbent worked
					tirelessly to ensure that his work was practically useful, examining the effects
					of noise, heat, and stress on attention in work environments, and he constantly
					reviewed his ideas as he worked. In the process, he gained government support
					for his ideas, and the respect of many industries whose practices were improved
					by his work. This led to yet more research into areas such as differences of
					attention between individuals, and lapses of attention and their causes. In each
					case the results of his experiments led to refinements of his theories. In 1971,
					he published a second book, <i class="calibre11">Decision and
						Stress</i>, which detailed an extended version of his filter theory.
					Like its predecessor, this book became a classic textbook of cognitive
					psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-561"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000159.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Complex industrial processes</span> could be

					scientists from other disciplines. His comparison of the workings of the human
					brain with electronic machines became more and more relevant as interest in
					computing increased. His model of the various stages of human information
					processing&mdash;acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use&mdash;echoed the work on
					artificial intelligence at that time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadbent was instrumental in setting up a Joint Council Initiative on
					Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction, which helped shape the
					development of cognitive science. His work also established applied psychology
					as an important approach for problem-solving, increasing its impact well beyond
					the confines of the laboratory. A key figure in the founding of cognitive
					psychology, his research into attention laid the groundwork for a new field of
					enquiry that continues to yield rich results today.</p></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-563"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">DONALD BROADBENT</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-564"><img alt="" src="images/000034.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Born in Birmingham, England, Donald Broadbent considered himself to be Welsh,

				learning, but the next generation of psychologists turned their attention to a
				behaviorist study of learning, and “conditioning” replaced memory as the focus of
				research. Apart from a few isolated studies, notably by Bluma Zeigarnik and Frederic
				Bartlett in the 1920s and 30s, memory was largely ignored as a topic until the
				“cognitive revolution” took place following World War II. Cognitive psychologists
				began to explore the idea of the brain as an information processor, and this
				provided a model for the storage of memory: it was seen as a process, whereby some

				shaped his approach to the subject, designing experiments that used no more than a

					unorthodox way, which occasionally earned him criticism from his peers, and was
					to make publishing his results difficult. His maverick instincts did, however,
					lead to some truly innovative research. One hurriedly designed, <i class="calibre11">ad hoc</i> demonstration to a class of students in the
					early 1960s was to provide him with the model for many later experiments. He
					read out a random list of 20 everyday words to the students, and then asked them
					to write down as many as they could recall, in any order. As he expected, most
					of them managed to remember around half of the list. He then asked them about
					the words that they had not remembered, giving hints such as “Wasn’t there a
					color on the list?,” after which the student could often provide the correct
					answer.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulving developed a series of experiments on this “free recall” method, during
					which he noticed that people tend to group words together into meaningful
					categories; the better they organize the information, the better they are able
					to remember it. His subjects were also able to recall a word when given a cue in
					the form of the category (such as “animals”) in which they had mentally filed
					that word. Tulving concluded that although all the words memorized from the list
					were actually available for remembering, the ones that were organized by subject
					were more readily accessible to memory, especially when the appropriate cue was
					given.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-569"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000065.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">In Tulving’s free recall experiments</span>,

					information, and the failings of that process, Tulving made a distinction
					between two different processes&mdash;storage and retrieval of information&mdash;and showed
					how the two were linked.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his research, Tulving was struck by the fact that there
					seemed to be different kinds of memory. The distinction between long-term memory
					and short-term memory had already been established, but Tulving felt there was
					more than one kind of long-term memory. He saw a difference between memories
					that are knowledge-based (facts and data), and those that are experience-based
					(events and conversations). He proposed a division of long-term memory into two
					distinct types: semantic memory, the store of facts; and episodic memory, the
					repository of our personal history and events.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulving’s experiments had demonstrated that organization of semantic
					information, such as lists of words, helps efficient recollection, and the same
					appeared to be true of episodic memory. But where semantic memories are
					organized into meaningful categories of subject matter, episodic memories are
					organized by relation to the specific time or circumstances in which they were
					originally stored. For example, a particular conversation may have taken place
					during a birthday dinner, and the memory of what was said would be stored in
					association with that occasion. Just as the category of “city” might provide a
					retrieval cue for the semantic memory “Beijing,” the mention of “40th birthday”
					might act as a cue for the retrieval of what had been said over that dinner. The
					more strongly these autobiographical memories are associated with the time and
					circumstances of their occurrence, the greater their accessibility is likely to
					be. “Flashbulb memories,” which are stored when a highly memorable event&mdash;such as
					the 9/11 terrorist attacks&mdash;occurs, are an extreme example of this.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulving described recollection from episodic memory as “mental time travel”,
					involving us in a revisiting of the past to access the memory. In his later work
					he pointed out that episodic memory is unique in featuring a subjective sense of
					time. Specific to humans, it involves not merely awareness of what has been, but
					also of what may come about. This unique ability allows us to reflect on our
					lives, worry about future events, and make plans. It is what enables humankind
					to “take full advantage of its awareness of its continued existence in time” and
					has allowed us to transform the natural world into one of numerous civilizations
					and cultures. Through this facility, “time’s arrow is bent into a loop.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Remembering is mental time travel."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Endel Tulving</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-571" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Encoding information</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Tulving realized that organization is the key to efficient recall for both
					semantic and episodic memory, and that the brain somehow organizes information
					so that specific facts and events are “pigeonholed” with related items.
					Recalling that specific information is then made easier by direction to the
					appropriate pigeonhole&mdash;the brain “knows where to look” for the memory it wants
					and can narrow down the search. The implication, he believed, is that the brain
					encodes each memory for storage in long-term memory, so that specific memories
					can be located for recollection by a more general retrieval cue. The cues that
					prompt episodic memory are usually sensory. A specific sound, such as a piece of
					music, or a scent can trigger a complete memory.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulvings’s theory of the “encoding specificity principle” was especially
					applicable to episodic memory. Memories of specific past events are encoded
					according to the time of their occurrence, along with other memories of the same
					time. He found that the most effective cue for retrieving any specific episodic
					memory is the one which overlaps with it most, since this is stored together
					with the memory to be retrieved. Retrieval cues are necessary to access episodic
					memory, but not always sufficient, because sometimes the relationship is not
					close enough to allow recollection, even though the information is stored and
					available in long-term memory.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike previous theories of memory, Tulving’s encoding principle made a
					distinction between memory that is available and that which is accessible. When
					someone is unable to recall a piece of information, it does not mean that it is
					“forgotten” in the sense that it has faded or simply disappeared from long-term
					memory; it may still be stored, and therefore be available&mdash;the problem is one of
					retrieval.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-572"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000348.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Different types of memory</span> are

					new area for psychological study. The publication of his findings in the 1970s
					coincided with a new determination by many cognitive psychologists to find
					confirmation of their theories in neuroscience, using brain-imaging techniques
					that had just become available. In conjunction with neuroscientists, Tulving was
					able to map the areas of the brain that are active during encoding and retrieval
					of memory, and establish that episodic memory is associated with the medial
					temporal lobe and, specifically, the hippocampus.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly due to his unorthodox and untutored approach, Tulving made innovative
					insights that proved inspirational to other psychologists, including some of his
					former students such as Daniel Schacter. Tulving’s focus on storage and
					retrieval provided a new way of thinking about memory, but it was perhaps his
					distinction between semantic and episodic memory that was his breakthrough
					contribution. It allowed subsequent psychologists to increase the complexity of
					the model to include such concepts as procedural memory (remembering how to do
					something), and the difference between explicit memory (of which we are
					consciously aware) and implicit memory (of which we have no conscious awareness,
					but which nonetheless continues to affect us). These topics remain of great
					interest to cognitive psychologists today.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-574"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000223.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Emotional events such as weddings</span> give

				early 1970s, cognitive and mathematical psychologist Roger Shepard proposed new
				theories of how the brain processes “sense data.”</p><p class="calibre13">Shepard argued that our brains not only process sense data, but also make
				inferences from it, based on an internal model of the physical world where we can
				visualize objects in three dimensions. The experiment he used to prove this, in
				which subjects tried to ascertain whether two tables&mdash;each drawn from a different
				angle&mdash;were the same, showed that we are able to perform what Shepard called “mental
				rotation:” turning one of the tables in our mind’s eye for comparison.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepard used a series of optical (and aural) illusions to demonstrate that our
				brains interpret sense data using both knowledge of the external world and mental
				visualization. Perception, Shepard said, is “externally guided hallucination,” and
				he described the processes of dreaming and hallucination as “internally simulated
				perception.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepard’s research introduced revolutionary techniques for identifying the hidden

					investigating why some memories are better stored or more easily retrieved than
					others. One of the foremost psychologists in the field, Gordon H. Bower, had
					noticed that emotion appeared to impact on memory. Bower carried out studies in
					which people learned lists of words while in different moods, and later had to
					recall them, again when in varying emotional states. He uncovered what he called
					“mood-dependent retrieval:” whatever a person has learned when unhappy is easier
					to recall when they are again unhappy. Bower concluded that we form an
					association between our emotional state and what is going on around us, and the
					emotion and the information are stored in memory together. It is then easier to
					recall facts that we learned when we were in the same mood as we are when
					recollecting them.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"People who are happy during the initial experience learn the happy events
						better; angry people learn anger-provoking events better."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Gordon H. Bower</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Bower also discovered that emotion plays a part in the type of information
					that the brain stores. When we are happy, he observed that we tend to notice&mdash;and therefore remember&mdash;positive things; when we are sad, negative things attract
					our attention and are committed to memory more easily. For example, Bower found
					that unhappy people recalled details of a sad story better than those who were
					happy when they read it. He called this “mood-congruent processing,” and
					concluded that episodic memory&mdash;of events, not just words or facts&mdash;is especially
					linked to emotions. The events and emotions are stored together, and we remember
					best the events that match our mood, both when they occurred, and when recalling
					them.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bower’s findings led him to study people in various emotional states,
					retrospectively observing their videotaped interactions with others. Memory and
					judgement of past behavior varied with current mood. This research helped Bower
					to refine his ideas about emotion and memory, and inspired further psychological
					examination of the role emotions play in our lives.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-586"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000147.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">An idyllic vacation</span>, according to

				realize that emotions deserved as much attention as thought processes, drives, and
				behavior was Paul Ekman, who came to the subject through his research into nonverbal
				behavior and facial expressions.</p><p class="calibre13">When Ekman began his research in the 1970s, it was assumed that we learn to
				physically express emotions according to a set of social conventions, which differ
				from culture to culture. Ekman traveled widely to all corners of the world, first
				photographing people in the “developed countries,” such as Japan and Brazil, and
				then people in far-flung, cut-off places without access to radio or television, such
				as the jungles of Papua New Guinea. He found tribespeople could interpret facial
				expressions as well as anyone in more globally-aware countries, which suggests that
				facial expressions are universal products of human evolution.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-590"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000099.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-591" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Basic emotions</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Ekman came up with six basic emotions&mdash;anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
					sadness, and surprise&mdash;and because of their ubiquity, concluded they must be
					important to our psychological make-up. He noted that facial expressions linked
					to these emotions are involuntary&mdash;we react automatically to things that trigger
					these emotional responses&mdash;and that this reaction often happens before our
					conscious mind has time to register the causes of that emotion. Ekman inferred
					not only that our faces can reveal our inner emotional state, but that the
					emotions responsible for these involuntary expressions are more powerful than
					psychologists had previously thought.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i class="calibre11">Emotions Revealed</i>, Ekman states that
					emotions can be more powerful than the Freudian drives of sex, hunger, and even
					the will to live. For example, embarassment or fear can override libido,
					preventing a satisfactory sex life. Extreme unhappiness can override the will to
					live. The power of the “runaway train” of emotions convinced Ekman that a better
					understanding of emotions would help to overcome some mental disorders. We may
					be unable to control our emotions, but we may be able to make changes to the
					things that trigger them and the behavior they lead to.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Running parallel to his work on emotions, Ekman pioneered research into
					deception and the ways we try to hide our feelings. He identified small
					tell-tale signs, which he called “microexpressions,” detectable when someone is
					either consciously or unconsciously concealing something. This has proved useful
					in devising security measures to counter terrorism.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-592"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000071.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="section_feature4" id="calibre_link-593"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">PAUL EKMAN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-594"><img alt="" src="images/000048.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Paul Ekman was born and spent his early childhood in Newark, New Jersey. At
					the outbreak of World War II, his family moved west to Washington, then Oregon,
					and eventually Southern California. Aged just 15, Ekman took up a place at the
					University of Chicago, where he became interested in Freud and psychotherapy,
					and went on to study for his doctorate in clinical psychology at Adelphi
					University, New York. After a brief spell working for the US Army, he moved to
					the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he began his research
					into nonverbal behavior and facial expressions. This work led to his studies of
					the concealment of emotions in facial expressions, which in turn took Ekman deep
					into the then-unexplored field of the psychology of emotions. He was appointed
					Professor of Psychology at UCSF in 1972, and remained there until his retirement

				clinical psychology away from seeing patients solely in terms of their disorders,
				toward a more holistic, humanistic approach. Psychologists such as Erich Fromm,
				Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers were beginning to think about what constituted a
				good and happy life, rather than merely alleviating the misery of depression and
				anxiety. From this grew a movement of “positive psychology,” which concentrated on
				finding ways to achieve this good and happy life.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-597"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000000.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre13">Central to the new psychology was the concept of “flow,” devised by Mihály
				Csíkszentmihályi in the 1970s, and fully explained in his book <i class="calibre11">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</i> in 1990. The
				idea came to him from interviewing people who appeared to get a lot out of life,
				either in their work or their leisure activities&mdash;not only creative professionals
				such as artists and musicians, but people from all walks of life, including surgeons
				and business leaders, and those who found satisfaction in pursuits such as sports
				and games. Csíkszentmihályi found that all these people described a similar
				sensation when they were totally engaged in an activity they enjoyed and could do
				well. They all reported achieving a state of mind with no sense of self, in which
				things came to them automatically&mdash;a feeling of “flow.” It starts, he said, with “a
				narrowing of attention on a clearly defined goal. We feel involved, concentrated,
				absorbed. We know what must be done, and we get immediate feedback as to how well we
				are doing.” A musician knows instantly if the notes he plays sound as they should; a
				tennis player knows the ball he hits will reach its destination.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-598"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000379.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">A good jazz musician</span> will pass into an

					serenity, which led Csíkszentmihályi to liken it to a state of ecstasy (in its
					truest sense, from the Greek <i class="calibre11">ekstasis</i>,
					meaning “being outside oneself”). A major part of the enjoyment of flow is the
					sense of being outside everyday reality, totally separated from the cares and
					worries of ordinary life. Flow, Csíkszentmihályi felt, is key to optimal
					enjoyment of any activity, and consequently to a fulfilling life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can flow be achieved? Csíkszentmihályi studied cases of people who
					regularly reached this “ecstatic” state, and realized that it always occurred
					when the challenge of an activity matched a person’s skills; the task was
					doable, but also extended their capabilities and demanded total concentration.
					Only a reasonable balance of ability and difficulty could lead to flow. If
					someone’s skills were not up to the task, this led to anxiety, and if the task
					was too easily done, it led to boredom or apathy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Csíkszentmihályi’s concept of flow was eagerly picked up by other advocates of
					positive psychology, and became an integral part of this new, optimistic
					approach. Csíkszentmihályi himself saw flow as a vital element in activity of
					all kinds, and thought it especially important in making work more rewarding and
					meaningful.</p></div><div class="section_feature2" id="calibre_link-600"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">MIHÁLY CSÍKSZENTMIHÁLYI</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-601"><img alt="" src="images/000354.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Mihály Csíkszentmihályi was born in Fiume, Italy (now Rijeka, Croatia), where

					1965. While still a student, he married the writer Isabella Selenga, and in 1968

				concerned with the cognitive processes of the brain, clinical psychology continued
				to examine ways to treat disorders such as depression and anxiety. The new cognitive
				therapies still focused largely on alleviating unhappy conditions rather than on
				creating and promoting happier ones. Martin Seligman, whose theory of “learned
				helplessness” (the spiral of acquiring pessimistic attitudes in illnesses such as
				depression) had led to more successful treatments in the 1980s, believed that what
				psychology offered was good, but it could offer more. He felt that therapy should be
				“as concerned with strength as with weakness; as interested in building the best
				things in life as repairing the worst.” Having studied philosophy, he likened the
				task of his “positive psychology” to that of Aristotle seeking <i class="calibre11">eudaemonia</i>&mdash;“the happy life.” Like his philosophical
				forebears, Seligman found this was not a matter of relieving or removing things that
				make us unhappy, but of encouraging those things that might make us happy&mdash;and first
				he had to discover what they were.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-604"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000309.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Good social relationships are, like food and thermoregulation, universally

					others, and enjoy company. They seemed to lead what he called “the pleasant
					life,” one of the three distinct types of “happy” life that he identified, the
					others being “the good life” and “the meaningful life.” The pleasant life, or
					seeking as much pleasure as possible, appeared to bring happiness, though
					Seligman found this was often short-lived. Less obviously, the good life, or
					being successfully engaged in relationships, work, and play, gave a deeper, more
					lasting happiness. Similarly, the meaningful life, or acting in the service of
					others or something bigger than oneself, led to great satisfaction and
					fulfilment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seligman also observed that good and meaningful lifestyles both involve
					activities that his colleague Mihály Csíkszentmihályi had described as
					generating “flow,” or deep mental engagement. The pleasant life clearly does not
					involve “flow,” but Seligman did find that all the “extremely happy people” he
					studied were also very sociable, and in a relationship. He concluded that
					“social relationships do not guarantee high happiness, but it does not appear to
					occur without them.” A good and meaningful life may bring <i class="calibre11">eudaemonia</i>, but having a pleasant life as well will
					intensify whatever happiness you achieve.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-606"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000279.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Enjoying social events</span> and the company

				mind has a way of defending itself against unacceptable or painful thoughts and
				impulses, by using an unconscious mechanism that he called “repression” to keep them
				hidden from awareness. Freud later modified his thinking to a more general theory of
				repressed desires and emotions. However, the idea that the memory of a traumatic
				event could be repressed and stored beyond conscious recall became accepted by many
				psychologists.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-611"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000233.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><p class="calibre13">The rise of various forms of psychotherapy in the 20th century focused attention
				on repression, and the possibility of retrieving repressed memories became
				associated with psychoanalysis so strongly that even Hollywood dramas began to
				explore the link. Memory in general was a popular subject among experimental
				psychologists too, particularly as behaviorism began to wane after World War II, and
				the “cognitive revolution” was suggesting new models for how the brain processed
				information into memory. By the time Elizabeth Loftus began her studies, long-term
				memory in particular was an attractive area for research, and repressed and
				recovered memory was about to become a hot topic, as a number of high-profile child
				abuse cases reached the courts in the 1980s.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Human remembering does not work like a videotape recorder or a movie

					recovering repressed memories. Previous research by Frederic Bartlett, Gordon
					Allport, and Leo Postman had already shown that even in the normal working of
					the human brain, our ability to retrieve information from memory can be
					unreliable; Loftus believed that this must also be true of the recollection of
					events that are so traumatic that they are repressed&mdash;perhaps even more so, given
					the emotive nature of the events.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Loftus began her research into the fallibility of recollection in the early
					1970s, with a series of simple experiments designed to test the veracity of
					eyewitness testimony. Participants were shown film clips of traffic accidents
					and then asked questions about what they had seen. Loftus found that the
					phrasing of questions had a significant influence on how people reported events.
					For example, when asked to estimate the speed of the cars involved, the answers
					varied widely, depending on whether the questioner had used the words “bumped”,
					“collided,” or “smashed” to describe the collision. They were also asked if
					there was any broken glass after the accident, and the answers again correlated
					to the wording of the question of speed. In later versions of the experiment,
					participants were verbally given false information about some details of the
					accident (such as road signs around the scene), and these appeared as
					recollections in many of the participants’ reports.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-613"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000178.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">In a 1974 experiment</span>, Loftus showed a

					and leading questions, made after the event in question. Misinformation can be
					“planted” into the recollection of an observer. The title of her 1979 book
					describing her experiments, <i class="calibre11">Eyewitness
						Testimony</i>, shows that Loftus was well aware of the implications
					of this “misinformation effect,” not only for the psychological theory of
					memory, but also for the legal process. Anticipating the controversy that was to
					follow, she wrote that “the unreliability of eyewitness identification evidence
					poses one of the most serious problems in the administration of criminal justice
					and civil litigation.”</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"In real life, as well as in experiments, people can come to believe things

					expert witness in the spate of child abuse cases of the 1980s. What she realized
					then was that memories could not only be distorted by subsequent suggestion and
					incorrect details introduced by misinformation, but may even be totally false.
					Among the many cases in which she was involved, that of George Franklin
					perfectly illustrates the different aspects of what came to be known as “false
					memory syndrome.” Franklin was convicted in 1990 for the murder of a child who
					was best friends with his daughter, Eileen. Her eyewitness testimony, 20 years
					after the murder, was crucial to the conviction. Loftus found numerous
					discrepancies in Eileen’s evidence, and proved her memories to be incorrect and
					unreliable in several respects, but the jury nonetheless found Franklin
					guilty.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the conviction was overturned because the court had been deprived of
					“crucial evidence:” the fact that Eileen had “recovered” the memory during
					hypnotherapy. Loftus believed that Eileen’s memory of seeing her father commit
					the murder was sincerely believed, but false, and had evolved because Eileen had
					witnessed her father commit other cruel actions, and “one brutal image
					overlapped another.” Loftus successfully argued in court that a combination of
					suggestion during hypnosis, existing frightening memories, and Eileen’s rage and
					grief had created a completely false “repressed memory.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Paul Ingram (which Loftus was not involved in) also pointed toward
					the possibility of implanting false memories. Arrested in 1988 for sexually
					abusing his daughters, Ingram initially denied the charges, but after several
					months of questioning confessed to them along with a number of other cases of
					rape and even murder. A psychologist involved in the case, Richard Ofshe, grew
					suspicious and suggested to Ingram he was guilty of another sexual offence&mdash;but
					this time, one that was provably fabricated. Ingram again initially denied the
					allegation, but later made a detailed confession.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-616" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Lost in the mall</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The evidence for the implantation of false memories was still anecdotal,
					however, and far from conclusive; Loftus suffered harsh criticism for what were
					then considered to be controversial opinions. So she decided to collect
					irrefutable evidence through an experiment that aimed to deliberately implant
					false memories. This was her 1995 “Lost in the Mall” experiment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Loftus presented each of the participants with four stories from their own
					childhood that had apparently been remembered and supplied by members of the
					participant’s family. In fact, only three of the four stories were true; the
					fourth, about getting lost in a shopping mall, was concocted for the experiment.
					Plausible details, such as a description of the mall, were worked out in
					collaboration with the relatives. Interviewed about these stories one week later
					and then again two weeks later, the participants were asked to rate how well
					they remembered the events in the four stories. At both interviews, 25% of the
					participants claimed to have some memory of the mall incident. After the
					experiment, participants were debriefed and told that one of the stories was
					false&mdash;did they know which it was? Of the 24 participants, 19 correctly chose the
					mall as the false memory; but five participants had grown to sincerely believe
					in a false memory of a mildly traumatic event.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, or whatever it is you
						think you remember?"</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Elizabeth Loftus</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Loftus had provided an insight into how false memories might form in real,
					everyday settings. For ethical reasons Loftus could not devise an experiment to
					test whether a truly traumatic false memory (such as child abuse) would be even
					more vividly recalled and sincerely believed, but she suggested that it would,
					in the same way that a more disturbing dream is more vividly recalled and even
					mistaken for reality. It was this idea that prompted her to say, “what we
					believe with all our hearts is not necessarily the truth.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in 1986, psychologists John Yuille and Judith Cutshall did manage to
					conduct a study of memory following a traumatic situation. They found that
					witnesses to an actual incident of gun shooting had remarkably accurate
					memories, even six months after the event, and resisted attempts by the
					researchers to distort their memories though misleading questions.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-617" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Questionable therapy</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Loftus points out that her findings do not deny that crimes such as abuse may
					have taken place, nor can she prove that repressed memories do not exist; she
					merely stresses the unreliability of recovered memory, and insists that courts
					must seek evidence beyond this. Her work has also called into question the
					validity of the various methods used to recover memory, including
					psychotherapeutic techniques such as regression, dream work, and hypnosis.
					Consequently, it raised the possibility that false memories can be implanted
					during the therapeutic process by suggestion, and in the 1990s several US
					patients who claimed they were victims of “false memory syndrome” successfully
					sued their therapists. Unsurprisingly, this apparent attack on the very idea of
					repressed memory earned an adverse reaction from some psychotherapists, and
					split opinion among psychologists working in the field of memory. Reaction from
					the legal world was also divided, but after the hysteria surrounding a series of
					child abuse scandals in the 1990s had died down, guidelines incorporating
					Loftus’s theories on the reliability of eyewitness testimony were adopted by
					many legal systems.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Loftus is acknowledged as an authority on the subject of false memory.
					Her theories have become accepted by mainstream psychology and have inspired
					further research into the fallibility of memory in general, notably by Daniel
					Schacter in his book, <i class="calibre11">The Seven Sins of

				human memory, allowing it to work efficiently. Some of the experiences we go through
				and the information we learn may need to be remembered, but much is irrelevant and
				would take up valuable “storage space” in our memory, so is “deleted,” to use an
				analogy with computers that is often made in cognitive psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-623"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000076.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"We don’t want a memory that is going to store every bit of every experience.
					We would be overwhelmed with clutter of useless trivia."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Daniel Schacter</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><p class="calibre14">Sometimes, however, the process of selection fails. What should have been tagged
				as useful information and stored for future use is removed from memory and therefore
				forgotten; or&mdash;conversely&mdash;trivial or unwanted information that should have been
				removed is kept in our memory.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Storage is not the only area of memory functioning with potential problems. The
				process of retrieval can cause confusion of information, giving us distorted
				recollections. Schacter lists seven ways in which memory can let us down:
				transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and
				persistence. In a reference to the Seven Deadly Sins, and with a nod to George
				Armitage Miller’s “magical number seven,” he calls these the “seven sins of memory.”
				The first three Schacter calls “sins of omission,” or forgetting, and the last four
				are “sins of commission,” or remembering. Each sin can lead to a particular type of
				error in recollecting information.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the sins, transience, involves the deterioration of memory,
				especially of episodic memory (the memory of events), over time. This is due to two
				factors: we can recall more of a recent event than one in the distant past; and each
				time we remember the event (retrieve the memory), it is reprocessed in the brain,
				altering it slightly.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent-mindedness, the sin that manifests itself in mislaid keys and missed
				appointments, is not so much an error of recollection but of selection for storage.
				Sometimes we do not pay enough attention at the time we do things (such as when we
				put down keys), so the information is treated by the brain as trivial and not stored
				for later use. In contrast to this is the sin of blocking, where a stored memory
				cannot be retrieved, often because another memory is getting in its way. An example
				of this is the “tip-of-the-tongue” syndrome, where we can nearly&mdash;but not quite&mdash;grasp a word from memory that we know very well.</p><div id="calibre_link-624" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Sins of commission</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The “sins of commission” are slightly more complex, but no less common. In
					misattribution, the information is recalled correctly, but the source of that
					information is wrongly recalled. It is similar in its effect to suggestibility,
					where recollections are influenced by the way in which they are recalled, for
					example, in response to a leading question. The sin of bias also involves the
					distortion of recollection: this is when a person’s opinions and feelings at the
					time of recalling an event color its remembrance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the sin of persistence is an example of the memory working too well.
					This is when disturbing or upsetting information that has been stored in memory

					in the body, and to watch what’s going on in the mind, learning neither to

					not as a springboard to the conclusion “I am a failure.” With practice we can
					learn to see mind and body as one thing: a “wholeness.” Each of us is more than

				and by the 1960s it was replaced as the treatment for some disorders by behaviorist
				therapies, or the newer cognitive therapy developed by Aaron Beck. Combinations of
				these approaches, under the umbrella term cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
				evolved in the 1980s, pioneered in Britain by Paul Salkovskis. CBT, he found, was
				especially successful in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); where
				psychoanalysis had failed to find a root cause for the disorder in repression or
				past trauma, Salkovskis explained the problem in terms of cognitive psychology, and
				offered a cognitive and behavioral treatment.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-634"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000325.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-635" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Obsessive thoughts</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Salkovskis suggests that obsessive-compulsive disorder has its basis in the
					sort of unwelcome and intrusive thoughts that we all have from time to time&mdash;the
					idea that something terrible is about to happen, or that we will suffer or cause
					some awful misfortune. Most of the time, we can put these thoughts out of our
					minds and carry on with life, but sometimes they are more difficult to shake
					off. At the extreme end of the scale, the thoughts become obsessive and bring
					with them a feeling of dread and responsibility. People predisposed to these
					kinds of obsessive thoughts find it difficult to make a rational appraisal of
					their importance, and overestimate not only any risk of harm, but also the
					amount of control they have to prevent it. Obsessive thoughts of catching and
					passing on a deadly disease, for example, may result in compulsive cleaning or
					hand washing. There is also a feeling of a responsibility to act, even if the
					action is out of proportion to the risk. The resulting compulsive actions can
					become ritual behavior patterns, carried out repeatedly in an attempt to gain
					control over a perceived threat.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive behavioral therapy combines cognitive and behavioral techniques to
					address both the cause and the symptoms of OCD to great effect. First, the
					patient is helped through cognitive therapy to recognize the obsessional
					thoughts for what they are, making a more rational appraisal of the risk and,
					crucially, of how much responsibility he or she has for taking preventative
					action. This cognitive approach helps reduce the distress. Alongside this,
					behavioral therapy techniques, such as desensitization (gradual exposure to the
					perceived threat) help the patient to control his or her compulsive behavior.
					Salkovskis uses CBT techniques to successfully treat anxiety, panic attacks, and

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-66"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="calibre10">As psychology became established as a scientific discipline, its
				scope was at first limited to the examination of the mind and its workings, before
				broadening to include the study of behavior. For much of the first half of the 20th
				century, this meant the emphasis was very much on a study of the mind and behavior
				of individuals and their responses to their environment, though it became increasing
				clear to some psychologists that “the environment” includes other people.</p><p class="calibre13">The field of social psychology emerged in the 1930s, when psychologists began to
				explore the interactions of individuals within groups and society as a whole. They
				examined the effect of social organizations on the individual, and the way that
				social structures are influenced by the psychology of their individual members.
				Social psychologists, as they were called, also studied the relationships between
				individuals within these groups and between different groups. This introduced a new
				set of topics to psychology, including group dynamics, attitudes, and prejudice, as
				well as social conflict, conformity, obedience, and social change.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-639"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000263.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-640" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Social environment</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Among the first to make a systematic study of the psychology of social groups
					was German&mdash;American Kurt Lewin, considered the “father of social psychology.”
					Lewin took a fresh look at the dominant behaviorist approach, examining how
					behavior results from the interaction between the individual and his
					environment, as well as the nature of that environment. In his studies of small
					groups, he laid the foundations for later examinations of group dynamics and how
					groups and their members bring about change.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviorism fell out of favor after World War II, and Lewin’s ideas about the
					effect of the social environment provided an alternative that was
					enthusiastically taken up by the next generation. The concept of “attribution”&mdash;the way we see and interpret the behavior of others&mdash;became an area of specific
					research, and from that came theories of conformity and cultural norms such as
					those of Solomon Asch. Erving Goffman’s best-known theory&mdash;that we act out
					certain behaviors to suit the impression we want to give to others&mdash;also came out
					of this new emphasis on the importance of social interaction.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Research in the 1960s shed light on the darker aspects of behavior; Melvin
					Lerner showed how victims are sometimes blamed for what happens to them, and
					Elliot Aronson explained that apparently aberrant behavior could be the result
					of circumstances rather than insanity. More controversially, especially at a
					time when the atrocities of World War II were still fresh in people’s minds,
					experiments by Stanley Milgram and Philip Zimbardo showed just how far the need
					to obey and conform affects our behavior.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-641" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Applying psychology</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The advent of cognitive psychology brought a new influence on social
					psychology. The effects of cognitive processes such as memory and emotion were
					highlighted by Roger Brown and Robert Zajonc, and these findings were exploited
					widely by the mass media and advertising, which began to play an increasingly
					important role in modern society. Mass media and advertising in turn had a
					growing effect on social structures, prompting theories of social constructivism
					by psychologists such as Serge Moscovici.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, social psychology has rapidly become more applicable to many
					different situations. It has influenced other areas of psychology&mdash;in particular
					psychotherapy, through William Glasser’s “reality therapy.” It has also impacted
					on other disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, and even politics and
					economics. The 1960s saw the rise of the civil rights movement and feminism,
					both of which challenged the status quo. Issues surrounding prejudice, cultural
					norms, and beliefs came to the fore, and the work of social psychologists such
					as Janet Taylor Spence did much to alter attitudes toward women, while others
					used Lewin’s process of social transformation to bring about organizational
					changes. Theories and models pioneered by social psychologists are now used by
					business, industry, and all kinds of social organizations, and more recently
					have been adopted as a means of achieving social and political reform in
					societies suffering from oppression, most notably in the “Liberation Psychology”
					espoused by Ignacio Martín-Baró.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				and evolved into the study of group dynamics that is invaluable to organizations
				today.</p><p class="calibre13">In his investigation of human behavior, Lewin developed field theory, which
				explores the forces and factors that influence any given situation. Lewin’s “field”
				refers to the psychological environment of the individual or the collective group at
				a particular point in time, and he identified two opposing forces present in any
				given field: helpful forces, which drive people toward achieving their goals, and
				hindering forces, which inhibit movement toward these goals.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-644"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000212.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"A person who has learned to see how much his own fate depends upon the fate of

					invaluable guide for successful transformation, both for individuals and
					organizations. The model shows that in order to carry out the process of change
					successfully, a person or organization leader must take into account the various
					influences at play both within the minds of individuals and within their
					environment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In explaining his change model, Lewin emphasizes that the entire situation,
					including all the relevant personal and environmental details, must be taken
					into account, as focusing on isolated facts can lead to a skewed perception of
					the circumstances. Not only must you have a thorough and holistic understanding
					of a situation in order to change it, but that understanding actually deepens
					throughout the change process, and therefore “you cannot understand a system
					until you try to change it.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewin’s model describes a three-step process for achieving personal or
					organizational transformation. The first stage&mdash;which he called “unfreezing”&mdash;involves preparing by recognizing that change is necessary, and dismantling old
					beliefs and practices. Change occurs in the second stage, and is often
					accompanied by confusion and distress as the old mindset or system breaks down.
					The third and final stage, “freezing,” occurs when a new mindset is crystallized
					and there is an accompanying sense of comfort and stability within the new
					framework. The process is difficult because it involves painful unlearning,
					difficult relearning, and the restructuring of thoughts, feelings, attitudes,
					and perceptions.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"We all need each other. This type of interdependence is the greatest

					people are naturally inclined to resist changes to their established mindsets
					and routines. It requires careful preparation; many change efforts within
					organizations fail simply because employees are not adequately prepared, making
					them more resistant to change and less likely to function effectively under the
					new system. Preparation might include creating an exciting vision for change
					that employees can rally around, communicating it effectively, developing a
					sense of urgency and necessity for change, providing employees with support, and
					allowing them to participate actively in the process.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;On an individual level, people may react to this stage defensively, not
					wanting to leave their comfort zone and undergo the challenge of learning new
					skills or accepting a new set of beliefs. This natural resistance can be
					overcome if the individual is helped to accept that the change is necessary,
					valid, and will lead to the best outcome, and if support is given to engender a
					feeling of psychological safety.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewin demonstrated the positive effect of creating an environment of
					psychological safety during the unfreezing stage (and of allowing active
					participation in the change process) in his efforts to convince American
					housewives to serve animal organs as food at home during World War II.
					Historically, offal had only been eaten by low-income families, but the American
					government wanted to ensure that nutritious food was not going to waste during a
					time of food shortages, especially as kidneys, livers, and hearts are all
					high-protein foods. The US Department of Agriculture called upon Lewin to help
					convince housewives to include these meats in their family meals. During
					interviews with housewives, Lewin realized that there were both helpful and
					hindering forces at play. The helpful forces, or incentives, toward changing the
					housewives’ view of organ meat was its high nutritional value. The hindering
					forces, or barriers, to change centered around the women’s view that the meat
					was inappropriate for them and their families, and to a lesser degree, that it
					would not taste good.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewin set up a study using two groups of housewives to explore the best ways
					of initiating change. The first group was told repeatedly that eating offal was
					beneficial for them, while the other group took part in a small group discussion
					focusing on how the food shortage problem could be eased if women like
					themselves could be convinced to take part in a program of using secondary cuts
					of meat such as livers, kidneys, and hearts. When around one-third of the women
					who had participated in the discussion group later served offal for dinner,
					Lewin concluded that increasing the level of people’s involvement also increases
					the likelihood of changing their attitudes and behaviors. Lecturing to the first
					group had proved ineffective, but in the discussion group he had created an
					environment in which women felt psychologically safe enough to express their
					concerns and opinions. Through exploring their beliefs as well as the realities

					with the daunting and confusing task of implementing a new system. They must
					give up familiar routines and practices and master new skills (which itself can
					arouse feelings of uncertainty or a fear of failure). In an organization, the
					new system will be defined by the leadership, and often relates to technology,
					structure, procedures, or culture. It is important at this stage to provide
					sufficient support for employees and ensure the elimination of obstacles.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the level of personal change, people cannot be given a new belief system,
					but must find and accept one for themselves. When an old belief has been proven
					wrong or ineffective, we are naturally inclined to replace the old value system
					with a new one, filling the uncomfortable void left by the unfreezing process.
					We do this in a combination of ways: relying on our instinctive feelings,
					studying role models, and looking more generally to the vast array of
					information available. We hope in this way to expose ourselves to a new piece of
					information that will solve the problem. Once this insight is achieved, we have
					accepted and established a new mindset.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the American housewives during World War II, Lewin provided the
					women with new information by educating them about the good taste and
					nutritional value of offal (thereby replacing their old belief that it was an
					inferior meat), and convincing them that given the reality of wartime food
					shortages, there was absolutely no shame in serving it to their families
					(thereby replacing their pre-wartime belief that they would be viewed as social
					inferiors for eating it).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-650"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000133.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Learning to use new technologies</span> in
							place of old ones is made easier by an increase in driving forces&mdash;such
							as the ability to contact friends and family worldwide, instantly and
							inexpensively.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-651" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The freezing stage</h2></div><p class="calibre14">After change has been implemented within an organization, it must become part
					of the company’s culture (or “frozen”) in order for it to be successful in the
					long term. The new thought processes, practices, and behaviors adopted during
					the transition must become routine. Management can help to ensure changes become
					more firmly established by publicizing the ways in which change has benefited
					the company, and by nurturing positive feelings toward the change among
					employees, perhaps by delivering rewards for implementing the new skills or
					processes. For example, in the 1990s, Continental Airlines was forced to file
					for bankruptcy. In order to stay in business, the management implemented a major
					change: they shifted the company focus from saving costs to putting out a
					quality product that met high customer standards. They decided to reward
					employees for adopting the new policies and practices (to ensure compliance to
					the new priorities) by offering them a $65 bonus if the US Department of
					Transportation rated the company among the top five airlines. The use of Lewin’s
					change model marked Continental’s evolution from being the poorest-performing
					airline to being named Airline of the Year.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the freezing stage marks a time when new beliefs and
					practices are tested through trial and error; this either reinforces the changes
					or starts a new change cycle. For example, after a week of serving offal to her
					family, a wartime housewife might assess whether her family seems to enjoy the
					meat, whether they seem healthy, and whether other families seem to be judging
					her positively or negatively based on her meal choices. If the answers to these
					questions are positive, she will continue to serve offal at dinnertime. If,
					however, her children do not appear to be as healthy as they were when eating
					chicken or steak, or if other women are criticizing her choice of meat, she may
					decide to abandon offal and look for other ways to feed her family, starting the
					unfreezing and change processes all over again.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewin’s pioneering experimental work into social systems has led him to be
					widely recognized as the founder of social psychology. He was the first
					psychologist to study “group dynamics” and organizational development in a
					methodical way. He applied rigorous social science to effect useful social
					transformation, and his work has been influential across the fields of
					experimental and social psychology.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"There is nothing so practical as a good theory."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Kurt Lewin</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-652"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">KURT LEWIN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-653"><img alt="" src="images/000108.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">German-American psychologist Kurt Lewin was born in 1890 into a middle-class

				autonomous beings when he devised an experiment to demonstrate our urge to conform.
				His famous experiment showed that when people are confronted with a majority
				opinion, the tendency to conform may be stronger than their commitment to what they
				perceive to be true. He detailed his findings in his 1955 paper <i class="calibre11">Opinions and Social Pressure</i>, which also discusses the
				social influences that shape a person’s beliefs, judgments, and practices. Asch
				wanted to investigate the effects of group pressure on individual decision-making,
				and how and to what extent people’s attitudes were influenced by social forces
				around them.</p><p class="calibre13">Turkish psychologist Muzafer Sherif set out to answer similar questions in 1935,
				using a visual illusion called the autokinetic effect, whereby a stationary spot of
				light seen in a dark room appears to move. He told the subjects of his study that he
				was going to move the light and asked them how far they thought it had shifted.
				Tested in groups, the participants’ estimates converged into a group norm, revealing
				that they used others’ estimates as a frame of reference in an ambiguous situation.
				Although Sherif believed that he had demonstrated the principles of conformity, Asch
				contended that&mdash;because there was no right or wrong answer to the task&mdash;no definitive
				conclusions could be drawn. Conformity, he believed, could only be measured in terms
				of an individual’s tendency to agree with group members who unanimously give the
				wrong answer on a task that has an unambiguous solution. The simple perceptual task
				that became known as the Asch Paradigm was designed to offer this.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-656"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000058.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"All the yielding subjects underestimated the frequency with which they

					individually into a group of five to seven “confederates” (people who were aware
					of the real aims of the experiment but were introduced as fellow participants).
					The group was shown one card with a line on it, followed by another card with
					three lines labeled A, B, and C, and asked which one of those three lines was
					the same length as the line on the first card.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was always organized so that the subject would give either the last
					or the penultimate answer. Over the course of 18 trials, confederates were
					instructed to provide the correct answers for the first six, but then to give
					identical but incorrect answers for another 12. This was to test whether or not
					the subject would answer correctly or whether he would match his response to
					that of the confederates when all gave the same&mdash;incorrect&mdash;answer. Initially,
					Asch thought that only a few of the subjects would comply with the confederates’
					answers. After all, the task was simple and the answers obvious; during the
					pilot study in which there was no pressure to yield to an erroneous group, only
					three errors were made out of 720 total trials. The results of the actual study
					were surprising. When surrounded by a group of people all giving the same
					incorrect answer, subjects gave incorrect answers on almost a third (32 percent)
					of the questions; 75 percent of them provided an incorrect response for at least
					one question. One person complied with the group giving a wrong answer on 11 out
					of 12 trials. Because the task was both simple and unambiguous, these figures
					indicate a high degree of conformity by the subjects. However, not a single
					participant conformed on all critical trials, and 13 of the 50 participants (26
					percent) never conformed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The results proved that the subjects themselves were highly consistent. Those
					who broke away from the group opinion and provided an independent answer did not
					succumb to the majority even over many trials, while those who chose to comply
					with the majority seemed unable to break this pattern.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-658"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000036.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">In the Asch Paradigm experiment</span>,
							participants were given a visual test. They had to decide which of the

							in all.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-659" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Explanations</h2></div><p class="calibre14">To get a deeper understanding of his results, Asch interviewed his subjects to
					find out why they offered incorrect answers. Some said they wanted to go along
					with what they believed to be the experimenter’s wishes and avoid upsetting the
					overall experiment. A few actually wondered if they were perhaps suffering from
					eye strain or were seated at a misleading angle. Some denied that they were
					aware of having given incorrect answers. Eventually, some admitted to knowing
					their answers were incorrect, adding that they did not want to stand out or
					appear different and foolish: they wanted to fit in. Asch also spoke to the
					subjects who had maintained correct and independent responses, and found that
					they had not been unresponsive to the majority, but had been able to recover
					from the doubt that they felt in order to give an honest account of what they
					saw.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Asch performed variations on the experiment to test what difference the size
					of the majority group made to levels of conformity. He found that just one
					confederate had virtually no influence on the subject’s conformity, two had only
					a small influence, but three or more encouraged a relatively stable tendency to
					conform. Unanimity in the confederates’ responses was a more powerful factor;
					but even if only one confederate offered an alternative answer, the subjects
					were much more likely to provide an independent (and correct) response. This
					finding highlights the power of even a very small dissenting minority.
					Furthermore, Asch discovered that if he allowed the participants to give their
					answers privately, by writing them down on a piece of paper, conformity
					noticeably decreased, and this held true even if the confederates were still
					giving their answers aloud.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-660" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Cultural norms</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Some psychologists hypothesized that Asch’s findings reflected the cultural
					climate of 1950s America during McCarthyism, when dissent was seen as
					anti-American and people were imprisoned for their opinions. Later studies found
					variations in levels of conformity. For instance, a study conducted in the early
					1970s (a time of liberal, progressive thinking in the US) found far lower rates
					of conformity. However, a study in the late 1970s showed a return to higher
					rates.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Conformity rates for cultures worldwide also differ. Researchers found that
					individualist cultures such as the US, the UK, and other Western European
					countries, where personal choice and individual achievements are valued highly,
					show lower levels of conformity than collectivist cultures such as Japan, Fiji,
					and African countries, where group belonging is valued highly.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists have criticized Asch’s methods on the grounds that he focused on
					a stripped-down version of group behavior that does not feature much interaction
					between participants, or that he was more focused on the individuals within a
					group than on the group dynamic. Others wonder if he overstated the power of the
					majority to influence the minority. Serge Moscovici, in particular, disagreed
					with Asch’s analysis and argued that an active minority could influence the
					majority and bring about change. Moscovici was inspired to develop his own
					studies to demonstrate how a consistent minority can affect the thinking of the
					majority.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Asch acknowledges that social life requires some consensus, he also
					emphasizes that this is most productive when each individual contributes his
					independent insight and experience. Consensus should not come out of fear or
					conformity; the fact that he found the tendency to conform was strong even among
					intelligent people raised questions about societal values and the quality of
					education.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Asch’s conclusions note the power (and danger) of social influence to shape a
					person’s beliefs and behavior. If something becomes normal for a group, social
					pressure will ensure conformity. Inspired by Asch’s theory, Stanley Milgram’s
					experiment on obedience showed that ordinary people are capable of cruelty when
					under pressure to conform.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the majority of participants in Asch’s study, even those who had
					conformed, stated that they valued independence of mind, leaving him optimistic
					about humanity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-661"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000009.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">US Senator Joseph McCarthy</span> launched a

				relates to how we create, maintain, and enhance our social identities. A fundamental
				aspect of social interaction, Goffman says, is that we try&mdash;either consciously or
				subconsciously&mdash;to manipulate and control the way that others perceive us. Whenever
				we interact with other people, we present a public image of ourselves. In some
				instances, we may be trying to influence a particular person (such as a job
				interviewer); in other situations, we may simply be trying to maintain a favorable
				image of ourselves. In his 1959 book, <i class="calibre11">The Presentation of
					Self in Everyday Life</i>, Goffman draws a parallel between impression
				management and theater, showing how the ways we present ourselves in the real world
				are similar to the performances of dramatic actors on stage. Each social interaction
				is driven as much toward having a particular effect on the audience as it is toward
				honest self-expression.</p><p class="calibre13">In fact, according to Goffman’s theory, personality is the sum of the various
				roles that a person plays in his or her life. This implies that the true self is not
				a private or internal phenomenon, but rather the dramatic effect of the ways in
				which a person presents himself publicly. “Life is a dramatically enacted thing,”
				Goffman says: creating a successful impression requires the right setting, props,
				wardrobe, skills, and a shared understanding of what constitutes being on stage (in
				the public sphere) versus backstage (in the personal, private sphere).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-666"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000342.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-667" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Performance skills</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Goffman believes that in real life, everyone has the ability to choose their
					own stage, props, and costumes to display to the audience. The main goal of both
					the social actor and the onstage actor is to maintain a sense of coherence
					through interactions with other actors. This can only be achieved when everyone
					agrees upon the “definition of the situation,” and on the characteristics,
					expectations, and limitations of a particular performance or interaction,
					signaling to each other the appropriate ways of reacting and fitting into the
					social setting.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;To be in proper accord, people must agree on their personal identities, the
					social context, and the collective expectations of behavior within that context.
					For example, celebrities attending an elite party have all implicitly agreed to
					understand that they are “celebrities at an elite party;” each will accept their
					defined role in that situation and encourage other actors and observers (or
					audience members) alike to accept this definition. However, if the particular
					definition of the situation becomes discredited&mdash;for instance, if the food at the
					party turns out to be nothing more special than pizza, or there are
					noncelebrities also in attendance&mdash;there is a tendency for people to pretend that
					nothing has changed, thereby encouraging an artificial sense of believability in
					order to keep the peace or to avoid embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Goffman himself was said to enjoy testing the limits of the rules that shaped

				base their explanations of human behavior on environmental factors. However, the
				Polish-born psychologist Robert Zajonc believed that to develop a more complete
				understanding, it is necessary to take into account the functions of the mind as
				well. Zajonc’s main interest was in the relationship between feeling and thought&mdash;the intersection of emotion and cognition&mdash;and he devoted much of his career toward
				exploring which of these factors has a stronger influence on behavior. To this end,
				he performed a seminal experiment in 1968 that led to his discovery of the “mere
				exposure effect,” which is arguably his best-known contribution to the field of
				social psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-673"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000244.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Novelty is commonly associated with uncertainty and conflict&mdash;states that are

					given stimulus is accessible to the subject’s perception, either consciously or
					subconsciously. The effects of mere exposure had been documented previously by
					the psychologist Edward B. Titchener who, in 1910, described the “glow of
					warmth” and feeling of intimacy that a person experiences in the presence of
					something familiar. However, Titchener’s hypothesis was rejected at the time,
					and the idea faded into relative obscurity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zajonc’s interest in the effect was aroused by a newspaper article that
					described a curious experiment that took place at Oregon State University in
					1967. The article stated that a “mysterious student” had been attending class
					for two months, enveloped in a black bag. The professor, Charles Goetzinger,
					knew the identity of the person inside, but none of the class had any idea who
					it might be. Goetzinger then observed the class to gauge their reactions over
					time. Initially, the students treated the black bag with hostility, but this
					softened in time and they were eventually friendly and even protective toward
					the person in the bag. Goetzinger noted that the students’ attitude gradually
					“changed from hostility toward the black bag to curiosity and finally to
					friendship.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zajonc’s groundbreaking paper, <i class="calibre11">Attitudinal Effects of
						Mere Exposure</i>, was published in <i class="calibre11">The
						Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> in 1968. Zajonc’s
					paper describes a series of experiments in which he showed participants a
					sequence of random images&mdash;geometric shapes, Chinese symbols, paintings, and
					pictures of faces&mdash;that were flashed in front of them so rapidly that they were
					unable to discern which were shown repeatedly. When subjects were later asked
					which images they preferred, they consistently chose the ones to which they had
					been most frequently exposed, although they were not consciously aware of this
					fact. What Zajonc seemed to have discovered was that familiarity brings about an
					attitude change, breeding affection or some form of preference for the familiar
					stimulus. This increases with exposure: the greater your number of exposures to
					something, the more affection you will feel toward it. To put it simply, “the
					more you see it, the more you like it.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers into the mere exposure phenomenon since Zajonc’s experiment have
					found that it is even possible to re-create this effect using sound rather than
					images. In 1974, the social psychologist D.W. Rajecki used fertile chicken eggs
					as test subjects, playing tones of different frequencies to different groups of
					eggs before they hatched, and then playing these tones to both groups of chicks
					again after hatching. Without exception, the chicks preferred the tones that had
					been played to them prenatally.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-675"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000007.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Zajonc’s 1968 experiment</span> tested the
							mere exposure effect by showing people slides of symbols with uneven
							rates of repetition; the more frequently someone saw a symbol, the more
							they claimed to like it.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-676" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Preferences are not rational</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Zajonc’s findings indicate that this preference for familiar things is based
					purely on the history of exposure to it, and is not affected by a person’s
					expressed personal beliefs or attitudes. This holds true even when exposures
					take place only on the subliminal level, when subjects are completely unaware
					that they are being presented with a stimulus. This discovery led to Zajonc’s
					claim that “preferences need no inferences,” meaning that affectionate feeling
					is not based on reasoned judgement. This is contrary to what most of us might
					imagine to be the case.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In a paper called <i class="calibre11">Feeling and Thinking</i>,
					written in 1980, Zajonc argued that feelings and thoughts are actually very
					independent of one another. Feelings not only precede thoughts during a person’s
					complex response to a stimulus, but are actually the most powerful determinants
					of a person’s attitudes and decisions. This paper was widely debated, and it
					helped to bring the study of emotion back to the forefront of Western
					psychology, in part because the theory bears important implications for the
					study of decision-making processes. It suggests that, contrary to what we may
					believe, it is not reason and logic that guide our decisions; in fact, we make
					fast, instinctive, emotion-based decisions before we have even had a chance to
					consider the choice cognitively&mdash;we make judgments without information. If this
					is true, it follows that our logical reasoning merely justifies and rationalizes
					the decisions we have already made, rather than actually serving to inform the
					choice in the first place.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Zajonc concludes that “affect is always present as a companion to thought,
					whereas the converse is not true for cognition.” We can never think about
					something without a feeling attached; as Zajonc says, we do not just see “a
					house,” we see “a handsome house” or “a pretentious house.” Every perception we
					have contains some affect, or feeling. The primacy of affect over cognition is
					also apparent in memory, he says, as Frederick Bartlett noted in his book,
						<i class="calibre11">Remembering</i>: “When a subject is being
					asked to remember, very often the first thing that emerges is something of the
					nature of attitude.”</p></div><div id="calibre_link-677" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Interpersonal attraction</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The impact of the mere exposure effect extends beyond the confines of the
					laboratory, and out into the area of interpersonal attraction. In this context,
					the phenomenon is referred to as the “propinquity effect,” the way we tend to
					form friendships or romantic relationships with people we see regularly. One
					explanation for this focuses on evolution: when animals are exposed to something
					for the first time, they often respond with fear and aggression, but repeated
					exposures&mdash;during which the animal realizes the perceived threat does not
					materialize&mdash;lead to a reduction in negative responses. Zajonc explored this
					notion further with human subjects, discovering that people form very negative
					attitudes toward an imaginary group of unfamiliar people, attributing unpleasant
					qualities to them for no apparent reason other than the fact that they are
					complete strangers. However, as with shapes and symbols, repeated exposure is
					shown to increase trust and affection.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another explanation for the propinquity effect focuses on the many factors
					involved in interpersonal attraction, which include familiarity, similarity of
					attitudes, physical attraction, and reciprocal affection. Frequent interactions
					between people may not only increase the level of familiarity, but also provide
					an increasing impression of similarity, thereby breeding positive feelings and
					ultimately attraction.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"The form of experience that we came to call “feeling” accompanies all
						cognitions."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Robert Zajonc</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-678" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Exposure and advertising</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Advertising is another arena in which the mere exposure effect plays a crucial
					role, although the picture here is less clear. Research seems to suggest that
					repeated exposure to a brand or corporate name would boost sales, but this
					assumption is evidently overly simplistic, as it doesn’t take into account other
					possible effects of frequent exposure.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One study used banner ads to test the mere exposure effect on college-aged
					students. Subjects were presented with an article to read on a computer screen
					while banner ads flashed along the top of the screen. The results indicated that
					those who had been exposed more frequently to the banner ads did indeed rate the
					ads more favorably than those who had seen it less frequently or not at all.
					However, another study found that familiarity with a brand name can create an
					ambivalent attitude. This may be because people have both good and bad
					associations with familiar companies, and all of these associations are brought
					to mind with frequent exposure, leading to greater ambivalence. As a result, it
					is unclear whether mere familiarity, created through repeated advertising, is
					good for sales.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-679"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000193.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Repeated exposure to a brand</span> can create

					someone, but it can even change the way a person looks over time. With a group
					of colleagues, he conducted a study to find out whether the faces of spouses
					appear more similar after 25 years together. They compared photographs of
					couples taken during their first year of marriage with those taken 25 years
					later, and found that couples looked more alike after many years of being
					together. After ruling out several other potential explanations, the researchers
					decided that empathy was the most likely cause. Time had increased the couple’s
					empathy for each other, and since human emotion is communicated through facial
					expressions, they may have begun to mimic each others’ expressions in the
					process of empathizing, resulting in similar wrinkle patterns over time.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Known for the breadth of his work on the basic processes of social behavior,
					Zajonc helped to create the modern field of social psychology. He used his work
					on thought and feeling to explore issues such as racism, genocide, and
					terrorism, hoping that research could ultimately help to prevent war and human
					suffering.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-681"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000167.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Couples grow to resemble each other</span>

					a hospital, after which he was arrested by Nazi soldiers and sent to a German
					labor camp. He escaped with two other prisoners and walked 200 miles (320km) to
					France only to be recaptured and imprisoned again. He broke out for a final time
					and made his way to the UK.</p><p class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;After World War II, Zajonc moved to the US, where he established himself as an

				a highly detailed, vivid account of the exact moment that they learned about an
				event with a high shock value.</p><p class="calibre13">The paper argues that culturally and personally significant events, such as the

				constructivists, argued that the voice of ordinary people was being lost from
				psychological research. The concern was that individuals were wrongly being
				portrayed as merely perceiving their social worlds rather than actually constructing
				them. In order to counteract these worrying trends, social psychologist Serge
				Moscovici conducted a piece of research that became a classic study of the way
				people absorb ideas and understand their world.</p><p class="calibre13">In his study, <i class="calibre11">Psychoanalysis: its image and its
					public</i>, published in France in 1961, Moscovici explored the belief
				that all thought and understanding is based on the workings of “social
				representations.” These are the many concepts, statements, and explanations that are
				created in the course of everyday interactions and communications between people.
				They allow us to orientate ourselves in our social and material worlds and provide
				us with the means to communicate within a community. They are, in effect, a
				collective “common sense”&mdash;a shared version of reality&mdash;that is built through the mass
				media, science, religion, and interaction between social groups.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;To test his theory, Moscovici looked at how the concepts of psychoanalytic theory
				had been absorbed within France since World War II. He studied mass-market
				publications and conducted interviews, searching for evidence of the type of
				information that had been floating around the collective consciousness. He
				discovered that psychoanalytic theory had trickled down both in the form of “high
				culture” and as popular common sense: people thought about and discussed complex
				psychoanalytic concepts in a way that seemed quite normal, but on the whole they
				were using simplified versions.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-691"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000015.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-692" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Molding common sense</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The translation of difficult concepts into accessible and more easily
					transmissible language is not problematic, Moscovici contends, because “the goal
					is not to advance knowledge, but to be in the know;” to be an active participant
					in the collective circuit. The process allows the unfamiliar to become familiar,
					and paves the way for science to become common sense. In this way, social
					representations provide a framework for groups of people to make sense of the
					world. They also affect how people treat each other within societies. Whenever
					there is debate over a controversial social issue&mdash;such as whether it should be
					legal for homosexuals to adopt children&mdash;the impact and importance of social
					representations becomes apparent.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Moscovici insists that social representations are genuine forms of knowledge
					in their own right, not diluted versions of higher-level information. In fact,
					he makes it clear that these everyday thoughts (rather than the more abstract,
					scientific versions) are significant, because “shared representations are there
					to set up and build a common ‘reality’, a common sense which becomes
					‘normal’.”</p></div><div class="section_feature1" id="calibre_link-693"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">SERGE MOSCOVICI</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-694"><img alt="" src="images/000401.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">Born Srul Hersh Moskovitch to a Jewish family in Braila, Romania, Serge

					do in order to be fulfilled, and this led him to develop Choice Theory. This
					theory holds that we are all motivated to act in ways that increase pleasure and
					decrease pain&mdash;we want to think and behave in ways that will make us feel better.
					All pleasure and pain, he says, derives from our efforts to satisfy five
					genetically encoded needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and
					fun. Any behavior that satisfies one of these is pleasurable, and any that fails
					to do so is a source of pain, and ultimately, he explains, it is only through
					human relationships that we can satisfy these needs. When we are struggling to
					survive, the help of another makes us feel good; in order to feel love and
					belonging, we need at least one good relationship; to sense even the least of
					our power, we need someone to listen to what we say; to feel free, we must feel
					free from the control of others; and while it is possible to have fun on our
					own, it is much easier with other people. For these reasons, he argues, “we are,
					by nature, social beings.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Glasser emphasizes that lasting psychological problems are usually caused by
					problems in our personal relationships (rather than signifying a biochemical
					abnormality in the brain), and distress can be remedied through repairing these
					relationships without recourse to psychiatric drugs. He points toward the basic
					human need for power, which we try to satisfy by attempting to control other
					people. In fact, the only thing that we can control is the way we behave and
					think; we cannot control others. Trying to, he says, shows a lack of respect for
					others and is the cause of unhappiness. Choice Theory is a self-control
					psychology designed to counteract this tendency and to help us find happiness
					within our relationships.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-699"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000118.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Interpersonal strife</span> with those close

				their lives. We need to believe that we live in a world where the good are rewarded
				and the bad are punished, and this contributes significantly to our sense that it is
				possible to predict, guide, and ultimately control events. This “Just-World
				hypothesis” is a tendency to believe that “people get what they deserve.” But,
				according to Melvin Lerner, this is a dangerous misconception that places undue
				importance on the supposed character traits of the people involved rather than on
				the actual facts of a situation. If someone is suffering or being punished, we find
				it easier to believe that that person must have done something to deserve such
				treatment. The Just-World theory becomes a comforting rationalization of seemingly
				inexplicable events, and stops the world from appearing chaotic or random. It also
				allows people to believe that as long as they are “good,” only “good” things will
				happen to them, generating a false sense of safety and control.</p><p class="calibre13">In his book, <i class="calibre11">The Belief in a Just World</i>, Lerner
				argued that we ask children to “be good” and promise them that in return for
				effectively putting their natural impulses and desires to one side, they will be
				rewarded in the future. For this contract to be fulfilled, we must live in a just
				world; and so children grow into adults with this belief firmly in place.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-704"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000046.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"People need to believe they live in a Just World."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Melvin Lerner</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-705" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Victim-blaming</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In a 1965 study, Lerner found that students who were told that a fellow
					student had won the lottery rationalized this event by believing that the winner
					must have worked harder than his peers. It seems that belief in a Just World
					allows people to adjust the facts of a situation. This can be especially
					damaging when applied to the way we might view victims of crime or abuse. In
					rape cases, for example, it is often suggested that the female victim was
					“asking for it” because she wore a short skirt or was flirtatious, effectively
					absolving the perpetrator of responsibility and placing it in the hands of the
					victim. By blaming the victim, outsiders also protect their own sense of
					safety.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lerner did emphasize, however, that belief in a Just World does not always
					lead to victim-blaming. The seeming innocence, attractiveness, status, and
					degree of similarity of the victim to those assessing them can affect whether or
					not people are held responsible for their misfortune.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lerner’s hypothesis became the foundation of important research into social

					State University, Ohio, in 1970 in which members of the Ohio National Guard shot
					and killed four unarmed students, wounding nine others. Some of these students
					had been protesting against the American invasion of Cambodia, but others were
					simply crossing the campus. The reason for the shootings remains ambiguous, but
					the fact that it was tragically unnecessary is clear. However, in the aftermath,
					one Ohio schoolteacher (as well as National Guard members) asserted that the
					students had deserved to die, and rumors spread quickly that the slain girls
					were either pregnant, had syphilis, or were filthy. Aronson argues that these
					rumors, though false, did not reflect the beliefs of psychotic minds, but rather
					the attempt of pressured and conflicted minds to find relief.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict felt by these people is known as “cognitive dissonance,” an
					unpleasant feeling experienced when two or more of one’s beliefs are
					inconsistent. In order to reduce this dissonance, people change their attitudes,
					beliefs, and actions, even if this involves justifying or denying cruelty
					against others. This, Aronson claims, is what happened after the Kent massacre.
					The townspeople wanted to believe in their National Guards’ goodness, and this
					meant believing their victims deserved to die. The idea that the slain had been
					wanton and dirty comforted the people, relieving the emotional conflict of
					believing that innocent students were needlessly killed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aronson claims that anyone could behave this way under similar circumstances.
					By understanding the reasons why people justify or deny the use of cruelty, we
					may be better placed to mediate or prevent it in wider social contexts, such as
					war or social prejudice.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-713"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000329.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Kent State University shootings</span>, in

				something inherently different about the 20th-century Germans; in the 1950s,
				psychologists such as Theodor Adorno had suggested that the Germans had certain
				personality characteristics that made them specifically susceptible to committing
				the atrocities of the Holocaust. Eichmann, however, claimed he had just been
				“following orders,” so Milgram set out to investigate if this could be true&mdash;would an
				ordinary person lay aside what he knew to be right or wrong merely because he was
				ordered to do so? His study went on to demonstrate important aspects of the
				relationship between authority and obedience, and it remains one of the most
				controversial experiments in the history of psychology.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-718"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000177.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"The most famous and controversial of all obedience experiments."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Richard Gross</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-719" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The power of the group</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Milgram believed that it was the situation of World War II and the compulsion

					and any of us might have behaved identically in that very same context. In the
					late 1950s, Milgram had worked extensively with Solomon Asch on his conformity
					studies and had witnessed people agreeing with the decisions of a group, even
					when they knew these decisions to be wrong. The experiments showed that people
					are prepared to do or say things that conflict with their own sense of reality.
					Would they also allow their moral judgments to be affected by the authority of a
					group or even a single figure?</p></div><div id="calibre_link-720" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The Milgram experiment</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Milgram set out to test whether normally kind, likeable people could be made
					to act against their own moral values in a setting where some kind of authority
					held sway. He devised an investigation of how obedient a selection of “ordinary”
					men would be when they were told by an authority figure to administer electric
					shocks to another person. The experiment took place in a laboratory at Yale
					University in 1961, where Milgram was a professor of psychology. The
					participants were recruited through a newspaper advertisement, and a total of 40
					men were selected from a wide range of occupations, including teachers, postal
					workers, engineers, laborers, and salesmen. They were each paid $4.50 for their
					participation; the money was given to them as soon as they arrived at the
					laboratory, and they were told that the payment was theirs to keep regardless of
					what happened during the experiment.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the laboratory, Milgram had created a phony (but very impressive and
					realistic-looking) electric shock generator. This had 30 switches marked in
					15-volt increments with labels that indicated the intensity of different ranges
					of shock levels, from “slight shock” at one end, to “extreme intensity shock”,
					“danger: severe shock,” and finally, one marked simply “XXX,” at the
					other.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the experimenter or “scientist” was played by a biology teacher
					who introduced himself to the participants as Jack Williams. In order to give
					the impression of authority, he was dressed in a gray laboratory technician’s
					coat and maintained a stern and emotionless demeanor throughout each of the
					experiments.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants were told that the study intended to investigate the effects
					of punishment on learning. They were told that of two volunteers, one would be
					the learner and the other the teacher. In fact, one of the two “volunteers” in
					each case was not a participant but a stooge: he was a likeable accountant
					called Mr. Wallace, who had been trained to play the role of the victim. When
					Mr. Wallace and the genuine participant drew paper from a hat to determine which
					role they would play, the draw was always rigged so that Mr. Wallace took on the
					role of “learner” in every instance. In full view of the participant, the
					“learner” (Mr. Wallace) was strapped into an “electric chair” with an electrode
					attached to his wrist; the participant was told that this electrode was attached
					to the shock generator located in an adjacent room. The participant heard the
					“scientist” tell the “learner” (Mr Wallace) that “although the shocks can be
					extremely painful, they cause no permanent damage.” To make the situation appear
					more authentic, the scientist then wired up the participant and gave him a
					sample shock of 45 volts&mdash;which was in fact the only shock strength that the
					generator could produce.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the participant was moved to the room containing the shock
					generator and asked to assume the role of “teacher.” He was asked to read a
					series of word pairs (such as “blue-girl,” “nice-day”) aloud for the learner to
					memorize. After this he was to read out a series of single words; the learner’s
					task was to recall the pairing word in each case and to indicate his answer by
					pressing a switch that illuminated a light on the shock generator. If the
					learner’s answer was correct, the questions continued; if the answer was
					incorrect, the participant was instructed to tell the learner the correct
					answer, announce the level of shock he was about to receive, and press a switch
					to administer the shock. Participants were instructed to increase the shock
					level by 15 volts (in other words, to keep moving up the shock scale on the
					machine) with every wrong answer.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-721"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000227.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Convincingly wired up</span>, Mr. Wallace

					participant would be required to start applying electric shocks. During the
					experiment, the learner would pound the wall once the voltage had reached 300,
					and shout: “I absolutely refuse to answer any more! Get me out of here! You
					can’t hold me here! Get me out!” As the shock level increased, the learner would
					shout more frantically, and then eventually cease making any noise at all;
					questions would be met with nothing but an eerie silence. The participant was
					told to treat any unanswered question as an incorrectly answered question and
					apply the next level of shock voltage. If he expressed misgivings about
					continuing the experiment, he received a verbal prod from the “scientist” to
					encourage him, from a simple request to continue, to finally being told that he
					had no choice but to go on. If he refused to obey after the last prod, the
					experiment was terminated.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In advance of the experiment, Milgram had asked several different groups of
					people, including ordinary members of the public as well as psychologists and
					psychiatrists, how far they thought participants would go when asked to
					administer the electric shocks. Most people thought participants would stop at a
					level that caused pain, and the psychiatrists predicted that, at most, one in
					1,000 would continue to the highest level of shock. Astonishingly, when the
					experiment took place, Milgram found that all 40 of the participants obeyed
					commands to administer shocks up to 300 volts. Only five people refused to
					continue at this point; 65 percent of the participants obeyed the instructions
					of the “scientist” right to the end, obeying commands to administer shocks to
					the top level of 450 volts.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their discomfort at doing so was often evident: many showed signs of severe
					distress, tension, and nervousness over the course of the experiment. They
					stuttered, trembled, sweated, groaned, broke out into nervous laughing fits, and
					three people had full-blown seizures. In every instance of the experiment, the
					participant stopped and questioned it at some point; some even offered to refund
					the money they were paid at the beginning. Interviews after the experiments
					confirmed that, with only a few exceptions, participants had been completely
					convinced that the “learning experiment” was real.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants were fully debriefed so they understood what had actually
					taken place, and they were asked a series of questions to test that they were
					not emotionally harmed by the experience. The participants were also reunited
					with the “learner” (Mr. Wallace) so that they could see that no actual shocks
					had been administered.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"With numbing regularity, good people were seen to knuckle under the
						demands of authority and perform actions that were callous and
						severe."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Stanley Milgram</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-724" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Feeling obliged to obey</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Milgram noted several features of the experiment that may have contributed to
					such high levels of obedience; for example, the fact that it took place at the
					prestigious Yale University gave it credibility. In addition, participants
					believed that the study was designed to advance knowledge, and they had been
					assured that the shocks were painful but not dangerous. Being paid may have
					increased their sense of obligation, as did the fact they had volunteered to
					take part. To test these explanations, Milgram ran many variations on the study,
					but changing the context had only minor effects on the results.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Milgram wanted to see if the inclination to obey authority figures can become
					the major factor in determining behavior, even in extreme circumstances. It is
					clear from the reactions and responses of the participants that obeying the
					“scientist” was violating their own sense of morality and negatively affecting
					them both physically and emotionally, but the pressure to comply was simply too
					powerful to defy in most cases.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This sense of obedience, Milgram felt, comes from the fact that people are
					socialized from a very young age (by parents and teachers) to be obedient and to
					follow orders&mdash;especially the rules set forth by authority figures. As Milgram
					says, “obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one
					can point to… it serves numerous productive functions.” But equally, the
					inhumane policies of the death camps in World War II “could only be carried out
					on a massive scale if a very large number of persons obeyed orders.” His
					experiments clearly demonstrated that normally harmless people become capable of
					committing cruel acts when a situation pressures them to do so.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In describing his results, Milgram also turned to the theory of conformism,
					which states that when a person has neither the ability nor expertise to make a
					decision, he will look to the group to decide how to behave. Conformity can
					limit and distort an individual’s response to a situation, and seems to result
					in a diffusion of responsibility&mdash;which Milgram felt was crucial to comprehending
					the atrocities carried out by the Nazis. However, the conflict between a
					person’s conscience and external authority exerts a huge internal pressure, and
					Milgram felt that this accounted for the extreme distress experienced by the
					participants in his study.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-725"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000176.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">By the 1960s, Yale University</span> was known

					first published, the ensuing controversy was so great that the American
					Psychological Association revoked his membership for a full year. However, it
					was eventually reinstated, and Milgram’s 1974 book <i class="calibre11">Obedience to Authority</i> received the annual Social Psychology
					Award.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The major concern was that the participants in the experiment were explicitly
					deceived, both about the nature of the study and about the reality of the
					electric shocks. Milgram’s defense was that he could not have obtained realistic
					results without employing deception, and all of the participants were debriefed
					after the experiment. Self-knowledge, he argued, is a valuable asset, despite
					the discomfort that the participants may have felt when forced to confront the
					fact that they behaved in a previously unthinkable way.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many psychologists remained uneasy, and the study was ultimately
					crucial in the development of ethical standards of psychological
					experimentation. It helped to define important principles such as the avoidance
					of intentional deceit of participants, and the need to protect experimental
					participants from emotional suffering.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular
						hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive

					sample: American men do not necessarily reflect the general population. Even so,
					Milgram was able to conclude that obedience was not a particular feature found
					in the minds of 20th-century Germans, but something more universal. A number of
					cross-cultural replications of the original experiment have demonstrated
					remarkably high consistency in results within societies, but slight differences
					between one country and another. For example, in most of North America and
					Europe, results are very similar to those found in Milgram’s original
					experiment, with very high percentages of obedience. Asian studies, however,
					show even greater levels of obedience (in East Asian and Muslim countries in
					particular), while aboriginal African and Latin American populations, as well as
					the Inuit peoples of Canada, show far less obedience.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-728"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000152.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">American soldiers in Vietnam</span> reported

					if participants were made explicitly aware that the situation was not real. His
					replication used a computer simulation of the learner and shock process, so
					participants administering the shocks were fully aware that the learner was
					computer-generated. The experiment was run twice: first with the virtual learner
					communicating only by text, and then with the computer-generated model visible
					on screen. Those with only text contact with the learner had little trouble
					administering the shocks; but when the virtual learner was visible, participants
					acted exactly as they had in Milgram’s original experiment.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-730" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Society demands obedience</h2></div><p class="calibre14">The notion of a society rests on an understanding that individuals are
					prepared to relinquish some personal autonomy and look to others of higher
					authority and social status to make decisions on a larger scale or from a
					higher, broader perspective. Even the most democratic of societies requires the
					rulings of a recognized, legitimate authority to take precedence over individual
					self-regulation, in pursuit of the greater collective good. In order for any
					society to function, its populace must agree to obey its rules. Legitimacy is,
					of course, the key, and there are countless historical examples of people using
					their authority to persuade others to commit crimes against humanity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally importantly, Milgram showed that it is “not so much the kind of person
					a man is, as the kind of situation in which he finds himself that determines how
					he will act.” Instead of examining personalities to explain crimes, he says, we
					should examine the context, or situation.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Milgram’s seminal study was heavily criticized at the time, not least because
					it painted an unappealing and chilling portrait of human nature. It is easier to
					believe that there are fundamental differences between the Nazis and the rest of
					humanity than to accept that in certain situations, many of us are capable of
					committing extraordinary acts of violence. Milgram held up a light to the dark
					realities concerning power and the consequences of our tendency to obey
					authority figures, and in so doing, he simultaneously absolved and made villains
					of us all.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-731"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000364.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The behavior of Nazis</span> during World War

					24 hours a day, and were given complete control over the prisoners, with
					permission to employ whatever tactics they saw fit in order to maintain order.
					To the researchers’ amazement, the environment quickly became so threatening to
					participants that the study had to be ended after only six days. Every guard
					became abusive and authoritarian; prisoners were denied food or bedding, hooded,
					chained, and made to clean toilet bowls with their hands. As the boredom

				realize that psychologists must take into account the historical context and social
				conditions of the people they are studying. He believed that while some mental
				health problems reflect an abnormal reaction to reasonably normal circumstances, the
				problems specific to oppressed and exploited groups tend to reflect a perfectly
				understandable and normal reaction to abnormal circumstances. Martín-Baró decided
				that psychologists needed to be more aware of how living within a difficult context

				psychology examined the psychological development of humans from childhood to
				adulthood: the psychoanalytic theory of Freud gave an account of psychosexual
				development in children, and behaviorism explained the mechanics of the learning
				process. However, the study of development itself&mdash;the psychological, emotional, and
				perceptual changes that occur during a lifetime&mdash;did not evolve until the 1930s, when
				Jean Piaget overturned conventional thinking with the idea that a child is not just
				a “miniature adult” gaining knowledge as his or her body matures, but at the same
				time is also going through radical psychological changes.</p><p class="calibre13">Piaget raised some fundamental questions: whether we acquire knowledge gradually
				or in distinct stages; whether certain abilities are innate or learned; and how the
				environment affects development. His cognitive development theory suggested that a
				child’s growth into adulthood is divided into several developmental stages, and
				within each stage the child learns by doing rather than instruction. Piaget’s ideas
				set the stage for the new field of developmental psychology and shaped the curricula
				of schools up to the present day.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other developmental theories soon emerged. Although broadly agreeing with Piaget’s
				findings, Lev Vygotsky argued that it was necessary for a child to have adult
				guidance at various stages in his learning, and also stressed the importance of a
				child’s social and cultural environment. Erik Erikson also built on Piaget’s ideas,
				identifying eight stages of psychosocial development, including the “identity

					learning, a growing area of interest arose from the research carried out by the
					British psychoanalyst and psychiatrist John Bowlby. His study of children who
					had been separated from their families during World War II led to the
					formulation of attachment theory, which deals with the way we build and maintain
					relationships with family and friends, placing a special importance on the
					attachments made by infants to the people who care for them; Bowlby saw this as
					a natural impulse for survival. The basic ideas of attachment theory were
					reinforced by experiments carried out by psychologist Harry Harlow in the US,
					who showed the effects of isolation and maternal separation on infants. His
					experiments demonstrated that to build healthy cognitive and social development,
					infants needed companionship and care. Later research by Mary Ainsworth built on
					these findings, adding the concept of a “secure base” from which an infant can
					explore the world. Bruno Bettelheim developed his own, more controversial,
					theories of childhood development from the basis of attachment theory, rejecting
					the importance of the traditional family after his study of children brought up
					communally in kibbutzim. In the 1960s, social issues such as the civil rights
					movement and feminism were influencing thought in both social psychology and
					developmental psychology. How our prejudices are acquired, and at what stage of
					development, became an area of interest for the African-Americans Kenneth and
					Mamie Clark, who based their work on studies of child development in Harlem, New
					York; while Eleanor Maccoby examined the differences in development between the
					sexes&mdash;the first of many similar explorations in the new field of gender
					studies.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Developmental psychology is currently exploring the causes and treatment of

				later fascination with epistemology, Jean Piaget carved out his own niche in a
				discipline that he called genetic epistemology, the study of how intelligence
				changes as children grow. Piaget was not interested in comparing levels of
				intelligence between children of different ages (quantitative cognitive change); his
				interests lay in the natural development of mental skills over time (qualitative
				cognitive change). Quantitative studies make possible numerical comparisons, but
				Piaget wanted to explore differences in the types, experience, and qualities of
				children’s learning, which required “qualitative” research. Breaking away from the
				prevalent behaviorist model, which had linked child development entirely with
				environmental factors, Piaget decided to explore the innate, or inborn, capacities
				that he believed guide children’s progression through a series of age-defined
				developmental stages.</p><p class="calibre13">Piaget believed that children are active and autonomous learners, using their
				senses to interact with the world around them as they move through the developmental
				stages. He also believed that it is of primary importance to nurture and guide
				children on this journey, giving them the freedom to experiment and explore on their
				own, in a very individual, trial-and-error manner. The task of a good teacher is,
				therefore, simply to support children on their journey through these stages,
				constantly encouraging their creativity and imagination, because “the goal of
				education is to create men and women who are capable of doing new things.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-751"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000232.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the

					concept of learning as an active personal process. From infancy through
					childhood, he says, learning arises from a child’s natural desire to sense,
					explore, move, and then master. For this reason Piaget had many misgivings about
					the notion of standardized testing, in which children undergo preformatted tests
					that have “correct” answers to provide quantitative measures of intelligence.
					While working on standardizing intelligence tests for Alfred Binet in the early
					1920s, he became interested less in a child’s ability to produce correct answers
					than in what those answers actually were. Their explanations revealed that
					children’s assumptions about how the world works are very different to those of
					adults, leading Piaget to believe that children not only think differently to
					adults, but also that children of different ages have different methods of
					thinking.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-753" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The evolving mind</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Since the 17th century, the idea that a child is effectively a miniature adult
					had held sway. Empiricist philosophers of the time had suggested that a child’s
					brain works exactly like an adult’s, but has fewer associations. Another group
					of thinkers, the psychological nativists, claimed that certain concepts&mdash;such as
					the ideas of time, space, and number&mdash;are innate, or “hard-wired” into the brain,
					so babies are born with an ability to make use of them. Piaget’s suggestion that
					children’s mental processes&mdash;from infancy to adolescence&mdash;are fundamentally
					different to an adult’s was a radical and controversial departure from this
					view.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Piaget himself claimed that it is vitally important to understand the
					formation and evolution of intelligence during childhood, because this is the
					only way we can reach a full understanding of human knowledge. His use of
					psychotherapeutic interviewing techniques to ask children to explain their
					answers was inspired, and it became an important tool in all his research.
					Rather than adhering to a pre-determined and impersonal list of questions, this
					flexible method allowed the child’s answers to determine the subsequent
					question. By following the child’s line of thought, Piaget believed he could
					better understand the processes underlying it. His rejection of a notion of
					quantitative or measurable intelligence led to some groundbreaking theories of
					childhood cognitive development.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-754"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000209.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Children are not mini adults</span> who simply
							do not yet know as much as adults; rather, they see the world
							differently and interact with it in a wholly distinct way.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-755" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Developing the intellect</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Piaget initially believed that social factors, such as language and contact
					with family members and peers, impacted most on children’s intellectual
					development. However, while studying infants, he realized that for them language
					is less important and their own activity is paramount. In the first few days of
					life, babies have limited bodily movements&mdash;mainly crying and sucking&mdash;though they
					quickly begin to add new actions, such as reaching for a toy. So Piaget
					concluded that action, rather than social interaction, is the source of thought
					at this stage.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery formed part of his theory that every child passes through
					various stages of cognitive development, and that these stages are different in
					quality and are hierarchical. A child only moves on to the next stage upon
					genuine completion of the current stage. In studies and observations, Piaget
					determined that all children pass through the stages in the same sequence,
					without skipping any or regressing to previous ones. This is not a process that
					can be rushed, and although children generally tend to go through the same stage
					at roughly the same age, each individual child has his or her own pace of
					development.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The four stages defined by Piaget represent levels in the development of
					intelligence and, as such, they provide a list of the “schemas” that children
					make use of at that particular moment in their development. A schema is a
					representation in the mind of a set of ideas, perceptions, and actions that
					provide a mental structure to help us organize our past experiences, and prepare
					us for future experiences. During infancy and early childhood, a schema can be
					as simple as “things I can eat.” However, as children grow, their schemas become
					more complex, offering an understanding of what constitutes “a kitchen,” a “best
					friend,” or “democratic government.” Intelligent behavior, according to Piaget,
					is comprised of a growing collection of schemas.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Knowledge… is a system of transformations that become progressively
						adequate."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jean Piaget</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-756" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Four stages of development</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Piaget’s first stage is called the sensorimotor stage, and this spans the
					first two years of a child’s life. During this period, infants learn about the
					world primarily through their senses (sensori-) and through physical action or
					movement (motor). Children at this stage are egocentric, able to see the world
					only from their own viewpoint. At the beginning of this stage, infants practice
					reflexes without understanding or intention; later they can extend and
					coordinate reflexes with objects. Then they begin to coordinate their senses in
					a way that anticipates events; for example, they can imagine objects that are
					not present and find hidden ones. They begin to experiment and set goals in
					their use of objects, and think about a problem before acting. These
					developments mark the completion of the first stage.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;As the child moves toward the development of self-awareness, they now have the
					tools of representational thought and can begin to develop and use internal
					images, symbols, and language. This constitutes the second, or pre-operational,
					stage when a child is primarily interested in how things look or appear. They
					will demonstrate skills such as arranging objects in a logical order (according
					to height, for example), or comparing two objects (such as blocks) through
					shared attributes, focusing on one perceptual quality (such as size or color) at
					a time. From years two to four, the child thinks in absolute terms (such as
					“big” or “biggest”); from four to seven, they begin to use relative terms (such
					as “bigger” or “heavier”). The ability to think logically is still limited and
					children remain egocentric, unable to see things from another’s
					perspective.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stage is the concrete operational stage, and this is when a child
					becomes capable of performing logical operations, but only in the presence of
					actual (concrete) objects. The child now begins to grasp the concept of
					conservation, understanding that the quantity of an object remains the same
					despite physical changes in its arrangement. They realize that if you pour
					liquid from a short, wide glass into a tall, thin one, the amount of liquid
					remains the same despite the difference in height. Children can also understand
					that objects can be sorted according to many qualities simultaneously&mdash;a marble
					can be large, green, or clear. A little less egocentric now, children begin to
					incorporate more relativity into their viewpoints.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth stage&mdash;the formal operational stage&mdash;children begin to
					manipulate ideas (rather than simply objects) and are able to reason purely on
					the basis of verbal statements. They no longer need to refer to concrete
					objects, and can follow an argument. They start to think hypothetically, and
					this new capacity for imagination, and their ability to discuss abstract ideas,
					reveals that they have now become less egocentric.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-757"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000181.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div></div><div id="calibre_link-758" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Reaching equilibrium</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In addition to defining the four stages, Piaget identified several fundamental
					facets of the developmental process that were required through each of the
					stages; assimilation, accommodation, and equilibrium. Assimilation is the
					process by which we incorporate new information into existing schemas.
					Accommodation is required when, in the process of assimilating, we discover that
					we need to modify existing knowledge or skills. A child who is able to
					assimilate successfully most or all new experiences is said to be in a state of
					equilibrium. However, if the existing schemas are inadequate for coping with new
					situations successfully, then the child is in a state of cognitive
					disequilibrium, and the schemas need to develop in order to accommodate the
					necessary information. Essentially, this is the process of adaptation, one of
					the most basic forms of learning.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-759" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Impact on education</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Piaget’s work inspired the transformation of the education systems of Europe
					and the US during the 1970s and 80s, bringing about a more child-centered
					approach to teaching, in theory and in practice. Rather than trying to teach a
					child to think and behave like an adult, educators were encouraged to view their
					work as an opportunity to engage children in novel and individual modes of
					thinking. Piaget believed that education should inspire people to create,
					invent, and innovate, and actively discourage them from conforming or following
					established guidelines at the expense of imagination. If the natural process of
					learning&mdash;from infancy onwards&mdash;is individual, active, and exploratory, then so
					too should be a system of education that guides children’s formal intellectual
					development.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another vitally important aspect of a child-centered education is an awareness
					of the concept of “readiness,” which involves setting limits on learning based
					on the child’s stage of development. One of Piaget’s most enduring contributions
					to the field of education, particularly with regards to mathematics and science,
					is the acknowledgement that teachers need to be aware of and honor an individual
					child’s capacity to deal with a novel experience or to take on fresh
					information. The tasks that a teacher sets should reflect, and also be adapted
					as precisely as possible to, the individual student’s cognitive level and
					capabilities. Piaget believed that children learn from being active rather than
					from passive observation, and teachers must adapt to this. Interaction between
					students is of primary significance in the classroom, and having established
					that one of the best ways to secure knowledge is to teach it to somebody else,
					it follows that if children are allowed to discuss topics actively among
					themselves (rather than listening passively to lessons), they are more likely to
					deepen and consolidate their existing knowledge.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-760"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000114.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Educators should not insist</span> on a
							particular way of doing or understanding something, Piaget (pictured

							processes.</p></div></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Intelligence is what you use when you don’t know what to do."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Jean Piaget</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-761" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Moral education</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As with intellectual development, Piaget believed that children also develop
					morally in stages and, for the most part, autonomously. Real moral growth is not
					the product of adult instruction, but is based on a child’s own observations of
					the world. Piaget viewed peer interaction as absolutely crucial for the moral
					development of children. Peers, not parents or other authority figures, are seen
					as being vital to moral growth, providing a key source for understanding
					concepts such as reciprocity, equality, and justice. Consequently, Piaget keenly
					promoted peer interaction within the classroom as an integral part of the
					learning experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the teacher in Piaget’s child-centered classroom is, therefore,
					almost one of a mentor and an enabler rather than that of a standard instructor.
					Teachers need to assess carefully each student’s current level of cognitive
					development and then set tasks that are intrinsically motivating. Interestingly,
					teachers must also create cognitive disequilibrium in their students in order to
					help them advance to the next stage of development, thereby providing genuine
					learning opportunities. They should focus on the process of learning, rather
					than on the achievement of end results, by encouraging their students to ask
					more questions, experiment, and explore, even if that means making some mistakes
					along the way. Above all, they must engender a collaborative space where
					students teach and learn from each other.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-762"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000131.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Children at this Montessori school</span>

					developmental psychology, education, morality, evolution, philosophy, and even
					artificial intelligence, Piaget’s ideas were not accepted without scrutiny and
					criticism. As with all highly influential theories, years of exploration and
					research have brought to light its problems and weaknesses. Piaget’s notion of
					egocentrism, for instance, has been called into question. Studies by the US
					psychologist Susan Gelman in 1979 demonstrated that four-year-olds were able to
					adjust their explanation of something in order to clarify it for a blindfolded
					person, and would use simpler forms of speech when talking to younger children,
					which is inconsistent with Piaget’s description of an egocentric child who has
					no awareness of the needs of others.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Piaget’s portrayal of children as primarily independent and autonomous in
					their construction of knowledge and their understanding of the physical world
					also met with some resistance, as it seemed to ignore the important contribution
					that other people make to a child’s cognitive development. Pioneering
					psychologist Lev Vygotsky’s work focused on proving that knowledge and thought
					are essentially social in nature, and disproving Piaget’s assumption that a
					child was not really a part of the social whole. His theory suggests human
					development exists on three levels: the cultural and the interpersonal as well
					as the individual, and his main concern was with the first two levels. His “zone
					of proximal development” theory&mdash;which states that children require the help of
					adults or older children to complete some tasks&mdash;served as a response to
					Piaget.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of exploration has been the assumed universality of the
					developmental stages identified by Piaget. Although he had no compelling
					evidence to support this assumption at the time, more recent cross-cultural
					investigations concerning the sensorimotor stage (including one study conducted
					by Pierre Dasen in 1994) indicated that the sub-stages suggested by Piaget are
					indeed universal, though environmental and cultural factors seem to affect the
					rate at which these stages are reached, and how quickly they are then
					completed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Piaget’s work unquestionably paved the way for many new areas of enquiry into
					the nature of child development and human cognitive development. He created the
					context in which a vast body of research took shape in the 20th and 21st
					centuries, and fundamentally changed the nature of education in the Western
					world.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-764"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000106.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Australian Aboriginal children</span> aged

				heredity and environmental influences.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-775"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000363.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Hope is both the earliest and the most indispensable virtue inherent in the

					versus mistrust.” If the infant’s needs are badly or inconsistently met,
					feelings of mistrust develop that can recur in later relationships. The second
					stage, “autonomy versus shame and doubt,” takes place from 18 months to 2 years.
					This is when the child learns to explore, but also for the first time must deal
					with feelings of shame and doubt as a result of small failures or parental
					reprimands. Healthy willpower develops as a result of learning to negotiate both
					success and failure.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage three, from three to six years, presents the crisis of “initiative
					versus guilt.” This is when children learn to act creatively and playfully, but
					also with purpose. As they interact with others they discover that their actions
					can adversely affect someone else. Severe punishments at this stage can inflict
					paralyzing feelings of guilt.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;From 6 to 12, children focus on education and learning social skills. This
					fourth stage is known as “industry versus inferiority,” and it provides a
					feeling of competence, although an over-emphasis on work can lead children
					mistakenly to equate self-worth with productivity. From here we enter
					adolescence and the fifth stage of “ego-identity versus role confusion.” This is
					when we develop a coherent sense of who we are, through consideration of our
					past, present, and future. When successfully negotiated, this stage ensures a
					unified sense of self, but problems here can lead to an “identity crisis”&mdash;a term
					coined by Erikson.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sixth stage of “intimacy versus isolation,” between the ages of 18
					and 30, we build close relationships and experience love. The penultimate stage,
					“generativity versus stagnation,” from 35 to 60, sees us working on behalf of
					future generations, or contributing to society through cultural activities or
					social activism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage, “ego-integrity versus despair,” starts at the age of around
					60. It occurs when people reflect on their lives, becoming either satisfied and
					at peace with their old age, or despairing over physical disintegration and the
					reality of death. Successful negotiation of this stage results in the attainment
					of wisdom.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-777"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000340.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Erikson said that in our older years</span> we

					Unsurprisingly, Erikson always struggled with identity issues. He was encouraged
					to study medicine, but rebelled and studied art, touring Italy in his youth as a
					“wandering artist.” He then suffered what he called an “aggravated identity
					crisis” and went to Vienna, where he taught art in a school run on
					psychoanalytic principles. Embracing these fully, he then trained as a
					psychoanalyst under Anna Freud. In 1933, he married Joan Serson and they
					emigrated to Boston, where he became the first child psychoanalyst in the city.
					He later taught at Harvard, Yale, and Berkeley. He changed his surname to the
					self-chosen “Erikson” when he became an American citizen in 1933.</p><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">Key works</h4><div class="calibre7"><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1950 </b><i class="calibre11"> Childhood and Society</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1964 </b><i class="calibre11"> Insight and Responsibility</i></p><p class="member"><b class="calibre16">1968 </b><i class="calibre11"> Identity: Youth and Crisis</i></p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div class="seealso"><p class="calibre19"><b class="calibre16">See also: <a href="#calibre_link-46" class="calibre3">G.

				was based on the psychoanalytical concept of “cupboard love.” This suggested that
				babies form bonds with people who fulfil their physiological needs, such as feeding.
				At the same time, the animal studies of Konrad Lorenz suggested that animals simply
				bond with the first moving object they encounter, which is usually the
				mother.</p><p class="calibre13">It was against this background that John Bowlby took a distinctly evolutionary
				perspective on early attachment. He argued that because newborn infants are
				completely helpless, they are genetically programed to form an attachment with their
				mothers in order to ensure their survival. Mothers, he believed, are also
				genetically programmed to bond with their babies, feeling the need to keep them in
				close proximity. Any conditions that threaten to separate mother and child activate
				instinctive attachment behaviors and feelings of insecurity and fear.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;These ideas formed the basis of Bowlby’s theory, which developed to explain the
				lifelong significance of the mother&mdash;infant bond as well as the psychological
				difficulties that children suffer if this bond is damaged or entirely broken.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-782"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000267.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Mother love in infancy is as important for mental health as are vitamins and

					always attach to a female, never a male. This female figure may not be the
					natural mother, but she certainly represents a mother-figure. The term he gave
					for this tendency to attach to a female is “monotropy,” and he emphasized that,
					although an infant may have more than one attachment figure, his attachment to a
					mother-figure is simply different from and more significant than any other
					attachment he will form throughout his life. Both the infant and his mother
					behave in ways that secure this attachment. An infant, for instance, engages in
					sucking, cuddling, looking, smiling, and crying in order to shape and control
					his caregiver’s behavior, and a caregiver would be sensitive and responsive to
					the infant’s needs. In this way the two behavioral systems&mdash;attachment and
					caregiving&mdash;help to shape one another and create a lifelong bond.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowlby believes that this bond is so deeply formative that if it fails to take
					place, or breaks down within the first few years of life, the child will go on
					to suffer serious negative consequences in later life. He also argues that there
					is a critical period during which a mother and infant should develop a secure
					attachment: it should take place during the first year, or at the very least
					before the child is two years old. Bowlby thought that any attempts at mothering
					beyond the age of three would be useless, and the child would be on course to
					suffer the effects of maternal deprivation.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Attachment behavior is held to characterize human beings from the cradle
						to the grave."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">John Bowlby</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-784" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Maternal deprivation</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In 1950, Bowlby was commissioned by the World Health Organization to study
					children who had suffered maternal deprivation during World War II due to
					evacuation or being made homeless. He was also asked to investigate the effects
					of being raised in residential nurseries and other large institutions (such as
					orphanages). The result of this early work was Bowlby’s 1951 report, <i class="calibre11">Maternal Care and Mental Health</i>, in which he
					observed that children deprived of maternal care for prolonged periods of time
					during early childhood suffered some degree of intellectual, social, or
					emotional retardation later in life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years later Bowlby began a second study, this time investigating children
					who had spent five months to two years in a tuberculosis sanatorium (which
					offered no substitute mothering) when they had been less than four years old.
					The children&mdash;aged 7 to 13 by the time of the study&mdash;were rougher in play, showed
					less initiative and more over-excitement, and were less competitive than those
					with a more traditional upbringing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In extreme cases, Bowlby found that maternal deprivation could even result in
					“affectionless psychopathy,” a clinical condition in which people are unable to
					care deeply for others and so do not form meaningful interpersonal
					relationships. Those who suffer from it display a higher incidence of juvenile
					delinquency and antisocial behavior without any sign of remorse, as they are
					unable to experience feelings of guilt. In Bowlby’s 1944 study of juvenile
					thieves, he found that many of the young criminals had been separated from their
					mothers for a period of more than six months before they were five years old,
					and of these, 14 had developed the condition of affectionless
					psychopathy.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this primary, secure attachment is so important, Bowlby says,
					is that it is essential for the development of an inner working model or
					framework, that the child uses to understand himself, others, and the world.
					This inner working model guides a person’s thoughts, feelings, and expectations
					in all of his personal relationships, even into adulthood. Because the primary
					attachment serves as a prototype for all future relationships, the quality of
					the attachment will determine whether or not a child grows to trust others, view
					himself as valuable, and feel confident in society. These working models are
					resistant to change; once formed, they determine how people behave and the kind
					of bond they will form with their own children.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-785"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000242.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Bowlby predicted that child evacuees</span>

					of the mother&mdash;child relationship and undervaluing the father’s contribution.
					Bowlby sees the father as having no direct emotional significance for the
					infant, contributing only indirectly by supporting the mother financially and
					emotionally. The evolutionary basis of Bowlby’s theory suggests that women are
					naturally inclined to be parents, with inborn maternal instincts that guide them
					through the process of child-rearing, whereas men are more naturally suited for
					being providers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, British psychologist Rudolph Schaffer&mdash;who worked under Bowlby at the
					Tavistock Clinic in London&mdash;found that there is considerable cultural variation
					in the extent to which fathers are involved in childcare. Increasing numbers of
					fathers are taking on the role of principal parent, which suggests that
					parenting roles are a consequence of social convention rather than
					biology.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowlby’s view implies that men will inevitably be inferior parents, but
					research by Schaffer and the American psychologist Ross Parke suggests that men
					are equally capable of providing warmth and sensitivity to their infants. They
					also found that a child’s developmental outcome is not determined by the
					parent’s gender, but rather by the strength and quality of the bond that is
					forged. In a further study, Schaffer and psychologist Peggy Emerson found that
					infants and young children display a wide range of attachment behaviors toward
					many people besides their mothers, and that multiple attachments may actually be
					the rule rather than the exception.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;These later findings were especially important for working women, because the
					implication of Bowlby’s theories was that women should not work once they become
					mothers; they should stay with the child, fulfilling the role of essential
					primary caregiver. For decades after Bowlby’s theory was posited, generations of
					working women were saddled with guilt, but many studies since then have
					questioned this aspect of Bowlby’s theory. For instance, in the 1970s
					psychologists Thomas Weisner and Ronald Gallimore showed that mothers are the
					exclusive caregivers in only a very small percentage of human societies, and it
					is not uncommon for groups of people (including relatives and friends) to share
					responsibility for raising children. Schaffer also points to evidence suggesting
					that children of mothers who are happy in their work develop more successfully
					than children whose mothers are frustrated from staying at home.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Direct observations of men in their fathering role has shown them to be as

					remains the most comprehensive and influential account of human attachment to
					date, and led to the groundbreaking experiments of Harry Harlow and Mary
					Ainsworth. Psychologists have used Bowlby’s basic premise to delve more deeply
					into childhood attachment patterns, and to develop theories of adult attachment
					by exploring how the bond between parent and child can influence the future bond
					between spouses and romantic partners. Bowlby’s theories have also had many
					beneficial effects on various aspects of child-rearing, such as the improvement
					of institutional care and the growing preference for fostering as an
					alternative.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-788"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000215.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Bowlby claimed that day care</span> centers

				correct, the baby monkeys would remain with the mother that provided food. But in

				theorist John Bowlby, developed a particular interest in the relationship between
				mothers and infants. In 1969, she experimented with a procedure that became known as
				the “Strange Situation,” which studied how babies balance their needs for attachment
				and exploration under varying levels of stress. In each experiment, Ainsworth placed
				a mother and her one-year-old baby in a room with toys for the baby to play with,
				and watched their interactions both before and after the introduction of a stranger
				to the room. The “situation” included periods when the mother left the baby alone
				with the stranger, then returned to the room.</p><p class="calibre13">Ainsworth found that the most important information about mother-child bonding was
				gleaned not from the baby’s reaction to the mother leaving the room, but rather from
				the infant’s reaction to her return. She suggested that a baby’s reactions upon
				reunion with his mother indicate three distinct patterns, or types, of
				attachment.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-799"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000376.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"Attachment behavior is strongly activated under circumstances when the

					needed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The babies who appeared to be indifferent to their mothers, and were hardly
					affected when she left the room, Ainsworth classified as “anxious-avoidant.”
					They were as easily comforted by the stranger as by the mother. About 15 percent
					of the infants fell into this group.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;A further 15 percent, described as “anxious-resistant,” were wary of the
					stranger, even with the mother present. They became intensely distressed when
					the mother left the room, but were also angry and resistant to contact on her
					return.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ainsworth claimed that a mother’s sensitivity largely determines the type of
					attachment. A sensitive mother, she stated, understands her child’s needs and

					high percentage of anxious-resistant infants, which may have been due to
					Japanese babies being less used to separation from their mothers than US
					infants. However, the Strange Situation is considered to be one of the most

				Clark, studied the psychological effects of segregation on African-American
				schoolchildren, particularly on their self-image. They designed a “doll test” that
				would indicate children’s awareness of racial differences and their underlying
				attitudes about race. Working with children between the ages of three and seven,
				they used four dolls, each identical in appearance except for the color of their
				skin, which ranged from shades of white to dark brown. The children showed an
				undeniable awareness of race by correctly identifying the dolls on the basis of
				their skin color, as well as identifying themselves in racial terms by choosing the
				doll that looked most like them.</p><p class="calibre13">In order to explore the children’s attitudes about race, the Clarks asked each of
				them to point out the doll they liked best or most wanted to play with; the doll
				that had a nice color; and the doll that looked bad. Distressingly, black children
				showed a clear preference for the white dolls and a rejection of the black dolls,
				which can be interpreted as indirect self-rejection. Convinced that this reflected
				the children’s tendency to absorb racial prejudices that exist in society and then
				to turn this hatred inward, the Clarks asked a very important question: “Who teaches
				a child to hate and fear a member of another race?”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-806"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000396.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Segregation is a way in which society tells a group of human beings that they

					and decided that as children learn to evaluate racial differences, according to
					the standards of society, they are required to identify with a specific group,
					and each racial group has an implied status within a hierarchy. That young black
					children preferred the white doll showed they were aware American society
					preferred white people, and had internalized this. Children as young as three
					had expressed similar attitudes to those of adults in their community.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clarks concluded that these attitudes are determined by a mix of
					influences, including parents, teachers, friends, television, films, and comics.
					Although it is very rare for parents to deliberately teach their children to
					hate other racial groups, many subtly and unconsciously pass on dominant social
					attitudes. Some white parents, for example, may discourage their children from
					playing with their black peers, implicitly teaching them to fear and avoid black
					children.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark’s 1950 summary of his research insisted that segregation was damaging
					the personalities of white and black children alike. His expert testimony in
					court cases tied into the 1954 <i class="calibre11">Brown v. Board of

					segregation was unconstitutional in public schools, contributed directly to

				interest in the study of sex differences, which had waned during the rise of
				behaviorism. Feminist concerns became increasingly important to US psychologist
				Eleanor Maccoby. Frustrated by the tendency of psychological literature to report on
				research findings that emphasized the differences between men and women rather than
				the similarities, Maccoby, with student Carol Jacklin, reviewed more than 1,600
				studies of gender differences. They published their findings in <i class="calibre11">The Psychology of Sex Differences</i> (1974) with the aim
				of showing that what most consider essential differences between the sexes are in
				fact myths, and that many gender stereotypes are untrue. Although some findings had
				shown boys to be more aggressive and more adept at mathematics and spatial reasoning
				than girls, and girls to have superior verbal abilities, subsequent studies revealed
				that these differences are either negligible or are more complex than they initially
				appear.</p><p class="calibre13">One difference that was consistent and undeniable was that “girls get better
				grades than boys” in school. Maccoby found this particularly interesting, especially
				considering that girls did not obtain higher aptitude test scores when all of the
				subject matter areas were reviewed. Furthermore, previous research into achievement
				motivation seemed to suggest that boys should outperform their female peers. Males
				were arguably more oriented toward achievement for its own sake than girls, showing
				greater task involvement, and more exploratory behavior; females were primarily
				interested in achievement relating to interpersonal relationships&mdash;exerting effort to
				please others, and demonstrating low self-confidence with respect to many
				tasks.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-813"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000299.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"Intellectual development in girls is fostered by their being assertive and

					that girls are higher academic achievers than boys, show greater interest in
					school-related skills from an early age, and are less likely to drop out before
					completing high school. Maccoby concluded that their better grades clearly
					reflect some combination of greater effort, greater interest, and better work
					habits than their male peers. Whatever discrepancy exists between boys and girls
					in terms of achievement motivation does not reflect school-related motivation.
					This motivation could prove significant throughout girls’ lives, as performance
					at school is also relevant to job performance.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing debate over inherent sex differences is tied up with general
					political questions about how society should be organized, and the roles that
					men and women are “naturally” equipped to fill. By pointing out that
					psychological literature tends to publish results indicating sex differences,
					while ignoring those indicating equality, Maccoby has fought against the

				the key to the problem lies at the intersection of Skinner’s operant conditioning
				and Freud’s psychoanalytic theory of identification, which explores how people
				assimilate the characteristics of others into their own personalities. Bandura’s

					punishments), but through observing others, is at the heart of social learning
					theory. This theory suggests that learning is achieved by mentally rehearsing
					and then imitating the observed actions of other people, who serve as models of
					appropriate or acceptable behavior. Bandura argued that “most human behavior is
					learned through modeling.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bandura noted four conditions that are necessary for a person to successfully
					model the behavior of another: attention, retention, reproduction, and
					motivation. Learning requires that the learner is paying attention to the
					behavior in the first place, that he remembers what he saw or heard, that he is
					actually able to physically reproduce the behavior, and that he has a good
					motive or reason to reproduce it, such as the expectation of reward.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the concept of reward is part of his social learning theory,
					Bandura’s move away from behaviorism is evident in his radical, anti-behaviorist
					ideas about the relationship between a person’s environment and his or her
					behavior. According to behaviorism, environmental circumstances entirely
					determine behavior, but Bandura believes in “reciprocal determinism”&mdash;the idea
					that a person influences the environment just as the environment influences him.
					Bandura conceived of personality as an interaction between three different
					components: the environment, behavior, and psychological processes (the ability
					to use language and entertain images in the mind). All of these components are
					relevant to the study of childhood aggression, which, Bandura argued, was
					learned by watching and modeling adults.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre20">"Behavior partly created the environment, and the resultant environment, in

					experiment on childhood aggression, which sought to explain how aggressive
					behavior develops, what provokes people to carry out aggressive acts, and what
					determines whether they will continue to behave aggressively. By proving that a
					child will imitate the behavior of an adult role model, the experiment showed
					the power of examples of aggression in society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;For the experiment, 36 boys and 36 girls, all between the ages of three and
					six, were recruited from a local nursery school. They were divided up into three
					groups of 24, each comprising 12 boys and 12 girls. The first group was the
					control group (which did not see any adult role model); the second group was
					exposed to an adult modeling aggressive behavior toward an inflatable Bobo doll;

					experiment were tested individually to ensure that they would not be influenced
					by their peers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experiments on the second group, each child watched an adult performing
					physically and verbally aggressive acts toward the doll. The adult pummeled the
					large Bobo toy with a mallet, flung it in the air, kicked it, threw it down on
					the floor, and beat it. When each child was later left alone in a room of toys
					that included a Bobo doll, he or she imitated a good deal of the aggressive acts
					performed by the the adult models, even creating novel acts of violence against
					the doll. Children in this group were also generally less inhibited than those
					in the other groups, showing an increased attraction to guns despite the fact
					that playing with guns was not modeled.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, children who were either in the control group or who were exposed
					to a passive adult model only rarely demonstrated any kind of physical or verbal
					aggression. Although Bandura did consider the possibility that observing
					aggressive acts merely weakened any inhibitions that the children may have
					already had about behaving violently, the fact that they often imitated the
					exact behavior they had just seen suggests that observational learning was
					taking place.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-823"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000402.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Children attack the Bobo doll</span> in

					prevalence of violence in the media. If a stranger performing aggressive acts
					can be a model of aggression for children, you might argue that television
					programs could also be considered a source of behavior modeling. Modern films
					and television shows include graphic violence, which is often expressed as an
					acceptable (or at least expected) form of behavior, which children who are
					regularly exposed to the media may feel inclined to imitate. This idea has been
					hotly debated. Many studies indicate that violent films and television shows do
					not increase a child’s tendencies toward violence. Some studies even indicate
					that exposure to violence can actually decrease the amount of aggression in
					children. This theory&mdash;known as the Catharsis effect&mdash;suggests that an individual
					may be able to relate to a violent on-screen character and release negative
					feelings, thereby becoming less aggressive personally than prior to the
					viewing.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other psychologists regard television as a form of education, and believe
					that, as characters often serve as role models for children, they should be
					positive models in order to help decrease the general level of violence
					prevalent in society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bandura himself does not believe in the Catharsis effect of viewing
					aggressive behavior, he was careful to note that there was a distinction between
					learning and performance. Children, he thought, could certainly learn aggressive
					behavior from viewing it, but knowledge of violent acts would not necessarily
					result in committing these acts themselves. He warned against assuming a more
					direct and causal relationship between violence in the media and real-world
					aggression.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Social learning theorists accept that cognition has a part to play in
					modeling, and that cognitive factors mediate the process between viewing
					violence and actually imitating it. For instance, the perception and
					interpretation of TV violence, and how realistic the program is, are both
					important intervening variables. Bandura also considers that environmental
					experiences are another influence in the social learning of aggression in
					children. Unsurprisingly, people living in neighborhoods with high crime rates
					are more likely to commit acts of violence than those living in low-crime
					areas.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-825"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000372.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Violence in computer games</span>, and in the

					aggression has important implications for our understanding of the development
					of gender identity. According to the gender development theory, one reason why
					boys and girls tend to exhibit differences in their behavior is that they are
					treated differently by their parents (as well as other significant adults and
					peers). It has been shown that people unwittingly tailor their behavior toward
					children from birth to match their own gender-role expectations; this encourages
					children to behave according to what are considered gender norms.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Bandura’s findings, children also learn how to behave through
					reinforcement and observation learning. By imitating the behavior of others,
					children are highly likely to receive positive reinforcement for the type of
					behavior that is considered most appropriate to their sex. They will also be
					either directly or subtly discouraged from behaving in ways that are not
					sex-appropriate.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there has been some criticism of Bandura’s work (often centered on
					whether his idea is truly a theory of cognitive development), his findings and
					theories are still cited and debated half a century later, reflecting the
					breadth and scope of his influence. His groundbreaking contributions span many
					of the fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, personality
					theory, and even therapeutic practices. His ideas also serve as a bridge between
					preceding behaviorist learning theories and subsequent cognitive learning
					theories.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bandura’s focus on processes such as attention, memory, and motivation marked
					a departure from studying only observable and measurable variables (the sole
					concern of behaviorists) and looked instead to the mental realm&mdash;the mind&mdash; for
					information about how people learn. For these reasons, Bandura is considered by
					many of his peers to be one of the most distinguished and influential
					psychologists of all time.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-827"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000350.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Behavior seen as sex-appropriate</span> in

				throughout childhood and adolescence. In 1956, he began a study involving 72 boys
				between the ages of 10 and 16. He presented the boys with moral dilemmas that
				required them to choose between two alternatives, neither of which could be
				considered completely acceptable, and noted their responses. One example was whether
				it was right or wrong for a man with no money to steal drugs that his sick wife
				desperately needed. Kohlberg followed up on 58 of the boys, testing them every three
				years over the course of 20 years, to observe how their moral inclinations changed
				with age. Based on the answers given by his subjects, Kohlberg identified six stages
				of moral development, which spanned three levels of moral reasoning:
				preconventional, conventional, and postconventional.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-832"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000275.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote4"><p class="calibre20">"Moral thought may be considered partially to generate its own data as it goes

					nine years of life, considers rules as fixed and absolute. In the first of its
					two stages (the stage of obedience and punishment), we determine whether actions
					are right or wrong by whether or not they lead to a punishment. In the second
					stage (the stage of individualism and exchange), right and wrong are determined
					by what brings rewards. The desires and needs of others are important, but only
					in a reciprocal sense&mdash;“You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” Morality at
					this level is governed by consequence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of moral reasoning starts in adolescence, and continues into
					early adulthood. It sees us starting to consider the intention behind behavior,
					rather than just the consequences. Its first stage, often called the “good
					boy&mdash;nice girl” stage, is when we begin classifying moral behavior as to whether
					it will help or please. Being seen as good becomes the goal. In the second stage
					(the law and order stage), we start to equate “being good” with respecting
					authority and obeying the law, believing that this protects and sustains
					society.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The third level of moral development is when we move beyond simple conformity,
					but Kohlberg suggested that only around 10&ndash;15 percent of us ever reach this
					level. In its first stage (the social contract and individual rights stage), we
					still respect authority, but there is a growing recognition that individual
					rights can supersede laws that are destructive or restrictive. We come to
					realize that human life is more sacred than just following rules. The sixth and
					final stage (the stage of universal ethical principles) is when our own
					conscience becomes the ultimate judge, and we commit ourselves to equal rights
					and respect for all. We may even resort to civil disobedience in the name of
					universal principles, such as justice.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kohlberg’s six-stage theory was considered radical, because it stated that
					morality is not imposed on children (as psychoanalysts said), nor is it about
					avoiding bad feelings (as the behaviorists had thought). Kohlberg believed
					children developed a moral code and awareness of respect, empathy, and love
					through interaction with others.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-834"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000252.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Mahatma Gandhi</span> was among the few who

				B.F. Skinner and Albert Bandura dominated psychologists’ conception of language
				development. These behaviorists believed that language&mdash;like all other human
				faculties&mdash;was a direct result of environmental input and learning, developed through
				the reinforcement and reward techniques at the heart of operant conditioning.
				Skinner noted that when children imitate verbal sounds, and form correct words, they
				receive immediate reinforcement and approval from their parents, which motivates
				them to continue learning new words and phrases. Bandura broadened the concept of
				imitation, noting that children imitated not only specific words and sounds, but
				also the general form and structure of sentences, as though filling in templates
				with specific words.</p><p class="calibre13">Linguist Noam Chomsky, however, did not believe that operant conditioning
				adequately explained the productivity, creativity, and innovation of language. It
				also seemed insufficient to explain children’s spontaneous use of grammatical rules
				that they have neither heard nor learned, as well as their ability to understand the
				meaning of an entire sentence without necessarily understanding the meaning of each
				word. For Chomsky, this ability is innate in humans&mdash;he claimed that “the language
				organ grows like any other body organ,” likening it to other features acquired
				through heredity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-838"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000202.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-839" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Nativism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Chomsky maintained that, although a child’s environment supplies the content
					of language, grammar itself is an in-built and biologically determined human
					capacity. To illustrate his point, he refers to other aspects of human
					development that we accept as being an inevitable outcome of heredity. The onset
					of puberty, for instance, is an aspect of human growth that is like the “growth”
					of the language organ. We assume unquestioningly that it is a genetically
					determined milestone, and though the specific details of its onset depend on
					several variable environmental influences, the fundamental process is the same
					across the human species. We take for granted that this is a result of basic
					biological programming. Language growth, Chomsky emphasizes, is another
					genetically programmed inevitability of human development, on a par with the
					processes that determine that we have arms instead of wings, or that build the
					structure of our visual or circulatory systems.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept that language is a part of our growth process is important because
					it highlights Chomsky’s belief that it is not a consequence of learning. He
					adopts a nativist perspective, focusing on the inherited contributions to
					behavior and minimizing the importance of environmental input. However, he
					believes that the environment plays a role in determining the specific direction
					of language growth, insofar as an individual’s language organ develops according
					to early experiences. For instance, because Chomsky grew up in Philadelphia,
					Pennsylvania, he absorbed knowledge of that particular English dialect and his
					language organ’s structure was tailored accordingly. The same process occurs for
					everyone, whether they have grown up in Paris, Tokyo, or London.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Language is a process of free creation."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Noam Chomsky</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-840" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Universal grammar</h2></div><p class="calibre14">But where is the proof that language acquisition is inborn rather than
					learned? According to Chomsky, the most convincing evidence for this claim is
					that there are aspects of grammar that are so intuitive and self-evident that
					they need never be discussed or learned in order to be understood (they are
					therefore part of our biological inheritance). For instance, there are certain
					constructions in the English language that permit the dropping of pronouns, and
					others that do not. The difference between the two is subtle, yet even by the
					age of six, native English-speaking children will use the constructions
					flawlessly. This implies that certain aspects of grammar are understood without
					requiring any instruction, and that the knowledge is therefore innate. This is
					the only way to explain how people have such a rich grammatical understanding
					and how children can use language so creatively by the age of six.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Chomsky claims that “universal grammar” is found worldwide, with modifications
					according to people’s native languages. It is a predefined mechanism that acts
					as the basis for the acquisition of any language. He argues that this is
					demonstrated by the way that all children are equally able to learn any language
					to which they are exposed. He says that a common set of linguistic features is
					built into the language organ through heredity, and it includes elements of
					grammar, meaning, and speech. It is what makes it possible for us to speak and
					learn human languages, and may make it impossible for us to learn any language
					that violates these principles.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"We are designed to learn languages based upon a common set of principles,

					Acquisition Device (LAD). He bases his claim for its existence on three things:
					the fact that children are born with the capacity to formulate and understand
					all kinds of sentences despite never having heard or learned them; that every
					human language appears to have certain universal elements; and that some
					grammatical principles are acquired by individuals regardless of their culture
					or intelligence. There is other supporting evidence as well, including the fact
					that the human vocal organs, breathing apparatus, auditory system, and brain are
					all specialized for spoken communication. Chomsky argues that, in light of the
					frequency with which children are exposed to the ungrammatical and incomplete
					speech uttered by their parents and other adults, only some kind of LAD can
					explain the fact that children seem to possess knowledge of grammatical rules.
					Finally, studies of deaf children provide further evidence for an LAD, revealing
					the untutored emergence of a “gestural language” that shares the basic
					principles of spoken language.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-842"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000174.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Deaf children communicate</span> using a

					from an innate program that is hard-wired in the human brain, but says that it
					arose through evolution and was therefore adaptive, helping our ancestors to
					survive. Chomsky disagrees with Pinker about how language evolved, arguing that
					language represents a distinct mental module that is unique to human beings and
					completely independent of general cognitive ability.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Linguist Jean Aitchison is also in agreement with Chomsky’s claim that
					children are hard-wired with knowledge of linguistic rules, but her view is that
					children have built-in problem-solving abilities that enable them to process
					linguistic data (and other forms of data). Chomsky maintains, however, that
					human beings’ innate language ability exists independently of other abilities,
					and because the mind is constructed of mental organs similar to those of the
					body, language can easily be isolated from other mental faculties.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticism also comes from Robin Chapman, an expert in communicative disorders,
					who argues that the study of language development should also be understood
					within the context of children’s social interactions. She notes that language
					structure is acquired piecemeal over several years, and that there are wide
					variations in how rapidly children acquire it, suggesting that social
					environment could also be a factor. There is also some degree of doubt
					surrounding Chomsky’s assumption that language is unique to human beings. Data
					from studies with chimpanzees and gorillas has suggested that the difference
					between ape and human language is quantitative rather than qualitative, which
					raises questions about how species-specific language really is.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Chomsky’s work has been highly influential across linguistics, psychology,
					philosophy, and even mathematics. Although the idea that children are
					predisposed to learn language is widely accepted, his claim that children have
					an innate knowledge of language that is not deeply influenced by their parents
					is highly controversial. He has been widely considered the most extreme nativist
					in the history of psychology, and although a biological source for language
					development is widely thought to be nearer the truth than one involving operant
					conditioning, it is still unlikely to offer the complete picture. Chomsky’s work
					has led to the emergence of more integrated views, which will no doubt lead to
					new research and understanding.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-844"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000149.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Studies of how chimpanzees</span> communicate

					His research suggests that the female brain is largely hard-wired for empathy,
					with females usually showing more sympathy for others, and greater sensitivity
					to facial expressions and non-verbal communication. The male brain, by contrast,
					appears to be geared toward understanding and building systems; it is mostly

					is therefore often better at tasks requiring decoding skills, such as map
					reading.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean, however, that there is a neat gender split. Baron-Cohen’s

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-29"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1></div><p class="calibre10">Theoretical psychology has largely been concerned with identifying
				and examining aspects of the mind and behavior that are common to us all, yet
				philosophers, and later scientists, have always recognized that there are
				differences in our psychological make-up that render us individuals. Some of the
				early philosophers explained differences in personality using the idea of the four
				humors or temperaments, but it was not until the 20th century that there was any
				truly scientific study of personality.</p><p class="calibre13">Behaviorists, as one would expect, saw personality as a product of conditioning,
				and psychoanalytical theory described personality as the effect of past experience
				on the unconscious&mdash;but these explanations resulted from research into more general
				theories rather than a study of personality itself. The first psychologist to
				systematically approach the subject was Gordon Allport, who felt that existing ideas
				of personality were inadequate. As one of the pioneers of what is now called “trait
				theory,” he identified a number of different personality traits, which he suggested
				showed themselves in three different levels in a combination unique to each person.
				The idea of traits became central to personality psychology and, following Allport’s
				work, it became a major new area of study.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-855"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000381.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-856" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Personality traits</h2></div><p class="calibre14">New ways of analyzing traits, such as Raymond Cattell’s factor analytical
					method, which identified 16 personality factors, led to refinement of Allport’s
					theories: reducing the number of traits that combined to form an individual
					personality. The prominent traits of introversion and extraversion were common
					to most of these models, and the distinction between them was felt to be a major
					factor in determining personality. They were incorporated into Hans Eysenck’s
					three-factor model, with its basic traits of extraversion&mdash;introversion,
					neuroticism, and psychoticism.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;One assumption that was questioned was whether personality traits would result
					in consistent behavior. Research conducted by Walter Mischel showed that
					different situations produced different behavior, and suggested that personality
					traits should be considered in the context of an individual’s perception of and
					reaction to various circumstances. Not only was personality found to be less
					consistent than had been assumed, but in some cases there was the possibility of
					an individual having more than one distinct personality. In a case made famous
					by a book and film, <i class="calibre11">The Three Faces of Eve</i>,
					psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley described multiple
					personality disorder, now called dissociative identity disorder.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-857" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">The intelligence factor</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Another factor that distinguishes us as individuals is intelligence. This had
					been studied from the earliest days of psychology, but had proved difficult to
					define or measure. Studies are also frequently controversial; since the time of
					Darwin and Galton, intelligence was assumed to be an inherited characteristic
					(and carried with it connotations of racial stereotypes and eugenics) rather
					than one influenced by environment. The issue of nature versus nurture in
					determining intelligence became key, with psychologists including Raymond
					Cattell and Hans Eysenck defending a hereditary viewpoint, and others arguing
					that not only is intelligence affected by environment, but the way it is tested
					is culturally biased, giving distorted results.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 20th century, British psychologist Charles Spearman had laid the
					foundations for a more objective, scientific study of intelligence by using
					statistical techniques to test and measure intelligence. He identified a single
					factor, the “g factor,” that correlated to all the mental abilities that make up
					general intelligence. This notion of a single measure of intelligence was
					challenged by J.P. Guilford, who believed that intelligence consists of a number
					of different abilities, an idea that led to Raymond Cattell’s theory of fluid
					and crystallized intelligence&mdash;two levels of reasoning and critical
					thinking.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Research into other areas of psychological difference has included emotions
					and facial expressions, pioneered by Paul Ekman and Nico Frijda, and
					psychological disorders, but David Rosenhan’s experiment showed that it is not
					easy to distinguish the “normal” from the “abnormal.” Individual differences
					appear to be points on a spectrum, rather than easily labeled divisions&mdash;
					highlighting the complexity and diversity of human psychology.</p></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div></div>

				discussed since the time of ancient Greece, the first systematic method of measuring
				intelligence was not developed until 1905, when the French psychologist Alfred Binet
				was asked to identify children who might benefit from educational assistance.
				Together with researcher Theodore Simon, he created the “Binet&mdash;Simon Scale,” which
				used memory, attention, and problem-solving tasks to measure and produce a number,
				or “quotient,” that summarizes intellectual ability. The average intelligence
				quotient (IQ) was set for convenience at 100, allowing psychologists to categorize
				people in relation to this score. In practice, around 95 percent of the general
				population score between 70 and 130, and the top 0.5 percent score over 145, the
				“genius” level.</p><p class="calibre13">Although the scale is still used for most IQ tests today, US psychologist J.P.
				Guilford believes it has fundamental flaws. Standard intelligence tests, he says,
				ignore creativity and assume that there is a “general intelligence” that can be
				represented by an IQ score.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-860"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000191.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-861" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Measuring creativity</h2></div><p class="calibre14">By definition, creativity means there is more than one answer to any problem.
					It requires a different kind of thinking, which Guilford calls “divergent,”
					since it goes in different directions and produces multiple solutions to a
					problem. In contrast, traditional IQ tests require thinking that ends up with a
					single answer: “convergent” thinking.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilford thought that creativity was measurable&mdash;it is indicated by the number
					of directions in which a person’s thoughts travel. He devised a number of tests
					to quantify divergent thinking, including his 1967 “Alternative Uses Test,”
					which asks participants to write as many uses as they can think of for: (a) a
					toothpick, (b) a brick, and (c) a paper clip. In his “Consequences Test,”
					subjects were asked to imagine all the things that might possibly happen if all
					national and local laws were suddenly abolished. Guilford scored the answers on
					levels of four key components: originality, fluency, flexibility, and
					elaboration.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilford claims that intelligence is not made up of just one “general factor,”
					but of three different groups of activities. “Operations” are the intellectual
					processes we use; there are six types of these, including memory, cognition, and
					evaluation. “Content” is the type of information or data involved&mdash;there are five
					of these, including visual and auditory content. “Products” are the results of
					applying operations to content, such as classes or relations, and there are six
					of these. The many ways in which we combine and use these different types means
					there may be anything up to 180 (6 × 5 × 6) types of intelligence&mdash;more than 100
					of these have already been verified.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity of Guilford’s theory and problems with testing mean that his
					tests are used less frequently than standard IQ tests, but his work has
					influenced research into intelligence and creativity.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-862"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000312.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Creative minds see even toothpicks</span> as

				fathers of personality psychology, as he was the first psychologist of modern times
				to embark on a dedicated study of personality. Since the early work on the four
				temperaments by Hippocrates (c.400 BCE) and Galen (c.150 CE), there seems to have
				been no attempt to classify personality in any detail. In the 19th century,
				personality was barely mentioned in psychology, though there was much discussion of
				the self, or “ego.”</p><p class="calibre13">In the early 20th century, the two predominant schools of psychology&mdash;psychoanalysis and behaviorism&mdash;were polar opposites in approach. Both were highly
				developed and influential schools that remain powerful (as well as enduringly
				controversial) to this day. Behaviorism, being interested only in how we acquire (or
				learn) our behavior, had nothing to say about personality; while psychoanalysis
				offered an in-depth approach, arguing for the existence of an unknowable unconscious
				that controls personality but reveals itself only fractionally and accidentally by
				slips of the tongue and in dream symbols.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The American psychologist Gordon Allport had fundamental problems with both of
				these approaches. He thought that behaviorism was wrong to discount the “person”
				doing the learning, because each person is unique and their perception is part of
				the process. He also considered psychoanalysis to be inadequate for explaining
				personality and behavior because it placed too much importance on a person’s past,
				ignoring their current context and motivations. His view was affirmed when, as a
				young college graduate, he paid a visit to Sigmund Freud in Vienna. On first
				meeting, to make small talk, Allport told Freud of a small boy he had met on the
				train on the way, who was afraid of getting dirty and refused to sit near anyone
				dirty, despite his mother’s encouragement. Perhaps, Allport suggested, the child had
				learned this dirt phobia from his mother, a neat and rather domineering woman. Freud
				then asked, “And was that little boy you?” Freud’s reduction of this small
				observation of Allport’s to some unconscious episode from his own childhood seemed,
				to Allport, dismissive of all his current motivations and intentions. Throughout his
				work, Allport emphasizes the present over the past, though later in his life he paid
				more attention to psychoanalysis as a supplement to other methods.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Allport argued for an approach to the study of human learning and personality that
				was reasoned, eclectic, and conceptually open-minded. He took some of what he
				believed from prevailing approaches, but his central belief is that the uniqueness
				of each individual and his or her personality is largely&mdash;but not exclusively&mdash;forged
				in human relationships.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-866"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000258.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"People… are busy leading their lives into the future, whereas psychology, for
					the most part, is busy tracing them into the past."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Gordon Allport</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-867" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Theory of personality</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Allport’s idea of personality is a complex amalgam of traits, human
					relationships, current context, and motivation. He identified two distinctly
					different approaches to the study of personality&mdash;the nomothetic and idiographic
					methods&mdash;both of which had been devised by the German philosophers Wilhelm
					Windelband and Wilhelm Dilthey, but had first been put into practice by
					Allport’s university tutor, William Stern. The first method, the nomothetic,
					aims to be as objective and scientific as possible, and it is exemplified in the
					study of human intelligence. This involves obtaining test results from large
					populations of people, on personality traits such as extraversion and
					introversion. Results can be submitted to a sophisticated analysis, resulting in
					a number of general conclusions, such as the percentages of people who are
					extravert or introvert, or variations linked to age, gender, or geography.
					However, this method does not aim to comment in any way on traits at the
					individual level; it focuses on comparative comments and conclusions about a
					certain trait, rather than any particular person. This was the method that the
					behaviorist B.F. Skinner used for his observations of rat behavior.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method, the idiographic, stands in direct opposition to the
					nomothetic method; it studies one individual in breadth and depth, taking into
					account their biography, their personality traits, and their relationships, as
					well as how they are seen and experienced by others. This method is much closer
					to the psychoanalytic method with its focus on one person, one life.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Allport said that while the nomothetic method was a way of describing traits,
					it had little explanatory power; whereas the idiographic method, though unable
					to draw any general conclusions, could explain one person in illuminating
					detail. He was to use both methods, though his work in general is not known for
					its focus on empirical research; he was more of a theorist, almost a
					philosopher. Yet his very first paper, <i class="calibre11">Personality
						Traits: Their Classification and Measurement</i>, cowritten with his
					brother Floyd, was an excellent example of the nomothetic method. One of his
					last major pieces of work, the analysis of Jenny Masterson, was an
					extraordinarily detailed example of the idiographic method.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Types exist not in people or in nature, but rather in the eye of the

					personality traits. They asked the participants to complete a personality
					questionnaire, and to ask three people who knew them well to complete it too;
					this reflected the Allport brothers’ view that personality is forged in
					relationship to others. They concluded from their results that there is a case
					for identifying traits, and for attempting to measure them. They also believed
					they had proven the possibility of developing a complete and sensitive
					instrument for the measurement of personality.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1936, Allport and his colleague H.S. Odbert proposed that individual
					differences that are most salient and socially relevant in people’s lives
					eventually become expressed through language; and the more important the
					difference, the more likely it is to be expressed as a single word. This idea is
					known as the lexical hypothesis. The two researchers went on to study the most
					comprehensive dictionaries of the English language available at the time, to
					find 18,000 words that described personality. They narrowed this down to 4,500
					adjectives that they considered to be observable and stable personality
					traits.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-869"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000179.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Allport and Odbert’s lexical hypothesis</span>

					distinct categories of traits: cardinal, common, and secondary. Cardinal traits
					are those that are fundamental to a person, governing their entire approach to
					life. Not everyone has a cardinal trait, according to Allport, but when they do,
					they may even be famous for them; in fact some people are so famous for them
					that their name becomes a byword for that trait, giving us terms such as
					Byronic, Calvinistic, and Machiavellian. On a less iconic scale, a person’s
					cardinal trait might be something like “a fear of communism,” where this is so
					central and important to someone that it guides and unifies their life in both
					conscious and unconscious ways; virtually every act is traceable to its
					influence.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his later years, Allport considered a person’s cardinal traits as
					contributing to the <i class="calibre11">proprium</i>: the essential
					drives, core needs, and desires of a person. This concept goes beyond the idea
					of temperament, and is more akin to a guiding purpose that will always press for
					expression. As an example of the <i class="calibre11">proprium</i>,
					Allport gave the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen, who had one dominant
					passion from the age of 15: he wanted to be a polar explorer. The obstacles to
					his ambition seemed insurmountable, and the temptation to relinquish his dreams
					was great, but the “propriate” striving persisted, and though he welcomed each
					success, it simply raised his level of aspiration. Having sailed the Northwest
					Passage, Amundsen embarked upon the project that led to his success in reaching
					the South Pole. Then, after years of planning and discouragement, he flew over
					the North Pole. His commitment never wavered, and he eventually died attempting
					to save the life of a less experienced explorer.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-871" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Less fundamental traits</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In contrast to cardinal traits, common traits are general characteristics,
					such as honesty, that are found in most people. These are the building blocks
					that shape our behavior, but they are less fundamental than cardinal traits.
					Common traits, Allport said, develop largely in response to parental influences,
					and are a result of nurture. They are shared among many people within a culture
					but in varying degrees; aggressiveness, for instance, is a common trait that
					varies by degrees. According to Allport, most of us have personalities made up
					of five to ten of these traits at a level whereby they have become our
					“outstanding characteristics.”</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, common traits may achieve “functional autonomy,” by which Allport
					means that although we start doing something for one reason, we may carry on
					doing it for quite another. This is because our motives today are not
					continuously dependent on the past. We may start learning to draw, for instance,
					to compete in popularity with another child in class, but ultimately become more
					interested in perfecting the craft for its own sake. This means that how we
					think and act today is only indirectly affected by our past. Functional autonomy
					is also thought to explain obsessive and compulsive acts and thoughts: they may
					be manifestations of functionally autonomous traits, where someone has no idea
					why he is doing something, but can’t stop himself from doing it.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Allport’s third category of traits, known as secondary traits, exert much less
					influence on us than cardinal or common traits. They are only seen in certain
					circumstances, because they are determined by context or situation. For
					instance, we might say of someone “he gets very angry when tickled” or “she gets
					nervous on flights.” These traits express preferences or attitudes that are open
					to change. In the absence of another person, secondary traits might be present
					but quite invisible. Added to the common and cardinal traits, they provide a
					complete picture of human complexity.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Any theory that regards personality as stable, fixed, or invariable is
						wrong."</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Gordon Allport</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div></div><div id="calibre_link-872" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Traits and behavior</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Allport was interested in how traits are forged in a person, and their
					connection with behavior. He suggested that a combination of internal and
					external forces influence how we behave. Certain internal forces, which he
					called “genotypes,” govern how we retain information and use it to interact with
					the external world. At the same time, external forces, which he named
					“phenotypes,” determine the way individuals accept their surroundings and how
					they allow others to influence their behavior. These two forces, he said,
					provide the groundwork for the creation of individual traits.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying these ideas to the story of Robinson Crusoe, Allport saw that, prior
					to his meeting with Friday, Crusoe’s genotypes, or inner resources, along with
					some phenotype aspects, helped him to survive alone on a desert island. He had
					the resilience to overcome his initial despair, and fetched arms, tools, and
					other supplies from the ship before it sank. He built a fenced-in compound
					around a cave, and kept a calendar. He hunted, grew corn and rice, and learned
					to make pottery and raise goats, and he also adopted a parrot. He read the Bible
					and became religious. These activities demonstrated the expression of Crusoe’s genotypical traits and resulting behaviors.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was only with the arrival of Friday that other aspects of his
					phenotypic behaviors could find expression: he helped Friday to escape from his
					captors; he named him; he had the patience and persistence to teach him to speak
					English, and the capability to convert him to Christianity. While Crusoe always
					had these personality traits, they remained unexpressed on the island until he
					formed a relationship with Friday. The idea is similar to a well-known
					philosophical puzzle: if a tree falls down in a forest, and there is nobody
					there, does it make a noise? For Allport, traits make behavior consistent; they
					are always there, even if no one is around to evoke them or witness them in
					action.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-873"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000230.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Genotype traits</span> are internal, but

						Interpretation</i> in 1937, Allport turned his attention to the
					topics of religion, prejudice, and ethics. But in 1965 he returned to the
					subject of personality by undertaking an idiographic study of the personality
					traits of Jenny Masterson, who lived from 1868 to 1937. During the last 11 years
					of her life, Jenny wrote 300 personal letters to a married couple with whom she
					was friendly. Allport used these letters for his analysis, asking 36 people to
					characterize Jenny’s personality traits from her letters. Eight trait “clusters”
					encompassing 198 individual traits were relatively easy to identify, with broad
					agreement from all the people rating the documents. These traits were:
					quarrelsome&mdash;suspicious; self-centered; independent&mdash;autonomous; dramatic&mdash;intense;
					aesthetic&mdash;artistic; aggressive; cynical&mdash;morbid; and sentimental.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Allport concluded that this trait analysis of Jenny was somewhat
					inconclusive, and so he went on to use a number of other frameworks, including
					Freudian and Adlerian analysis. Assisted by his students Jeffrey Paige and
					Alfred Baldwin, he also applied “content analysis” to the material. This was a
					new form of computerized analysis, where the computer was programmed to count
					the number of times words or phrases occur that are related to a given topic or
					emotion. Allport was particularly impressed by this new method because of its
					potential to analyze idiographic data, confirming his belief that the
					idiographic approach can identify subtleties of an individual character that
					trait questionnaires alone cannot reveal.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, Allport published a paper entitled <i class="calibre11">Traits
						Revisited</i> suggesting that the aim of personality study should not
					be the microanalysis of individual traits, but the study of the psychic
					organization of the whole person. He stated that his early writings about traits
					were written in an age of psychological innocence, although he maintained his
					belief that traits are a reasonable starting point for the description of
					personality.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Personality is far too complex a thing to be trussed up in a conceptual

					he is rarely credited directly. Much of modern personality testing derives from
					the work of Raymond Cattell and Hans Eysenck, and both of these psychologists
					drew upon Allport’s lexical study. Cattell’s “16 Personality Factor
					Questionnaire,” which is still used by psychologists today, uses 16 traits
					identified by Cattell through computer analysis of Allport and Odbert’s original
					4,500 adjectives.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanistic psychology, which forms the basis of most counseling and
					therapeutic practices, also relies heavily upon Allport’s ideas, particularly
					his idiographic method and insistence upon the uniqueness of each and every
					person. Increased focus on the practitioner&mdash;client relationship as a vehicle for
					the expression and development of personality has its roots in Allport’s
					assertion that personality is largely a function of relationships.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Allport was also one of the first to point out that even those psychological
					theories that attempt to explore positive human experience are based “largely
					upon the behavior of sick and anxious people or upon the antics of captive and
					desperate rats.” He wondered why there were no theories based on the study of
					healthy human beings, and those who strive to make life worth living. He pointed
					out that most studies are of criminals, not of law abiders; of fear, not
					courage; and focus on the blindness of humans, rather than their vision. The
					burgeoning school of positive psychology, led by Martin Seligman, has taken up
					this idea and aims to develop a scientific psychology of positive
					experience.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1955, when Allport wrote <i class="calibre11">Becoming</i>, his
					thinking had developed further; he now saw human striving toward a higher level
					of consciousness and realization as the true motive of personality. The idea
					that “becoming” is the ultimate goal of human beings was also developed by the
					psychologists Carl Rogers and then Abraham Maslow, who renamed it
					“self-actualization.” Although Allport’s work is cited less often than other
					well-known figures, he had a profound and lasting influence on the field of
					psychology.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote5"><p class="calibre20">"Allport urged psychologists to study personality traits and leave

				psychologists of the 20th century, contributed hugely to the study of human
				intelligence, motivation, and personality. His interest in intelligence was sparked
				early in his career when he was a student of Charles Spearman, the British
				psychologist who defined “g”&mdash;a single-factor, general intelligence that serves as
				the foundation for all learning.</p><p class="calibre13">In 1941, Cattell developed this concept further, defining two different types of
				intelligence that made up “g:” fluid and crystallized intelligence. Fluid
				intelligence is a series of thinking or reasoning abilities that can be applied to
				any issue or “content.” Sometimes described as the intelligence we use when we don’t
				already know how to do something, it comes into play automatically in processes such
				as problem-solving and pattern recognition, and it is thought to be closely related
				to working memory capacity.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cattell suggests fluid intelligence is genetically inherited, which may account
				for individual differences. It builds to a peak in young adulthood, then steadily
				declines, perhaps because of age-related changes in the brain. Brain injury can
				affect fluid intelligence, which suggests it is largely physiological.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-881"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000105.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-882" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Crystallized intelligence</h2></div><p class="calibre14">As we use fluid intelligence for solving problems, we begin to develop stores
					of knowledge and working hypotheses about the world around us. This store of
					knowledge is our crystallized intelligence, described by Cattell as “the set of
					judgmental skills” gained from investing fluid intelligence in cultural
					activities. Vast differences in learning experiences occur because of factors
					such as social class, age, nationality, and historical era.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystallized intelligence includes skills such as verbal comprehension and
					numerical facility, because these abilities rely on knowledge already gained&mdash;such as the rules of grammar or addition, subtraction, and other mathematical
					concepts. This form of intelligence increases gradually over a lifetime and
					stays relatively stable until we are around 65 years old, when it begins to
					decline.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cattell sees fluid and crystallized intelligence as fairly independent of each
					other, but reasons that having a higher fluid intelligence might lead to the
					broader and faster development of crystallized intelligence, depending on
					factors relating to personality and interests. Noting that standard IQ tests
					tend to assess a combination of fluid and crystallized intelligence, Cattell
					developed tests to assess fluid intelligence in isolation. His culture-fair
					intelligence test, which uses nonverbal, multiple-choice questions based on
					shapes and patterns, requires no prior learning from the participants and can be
					used to test children and adults from any culture.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-883"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000079.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The culture-fair intelligence test</span> was

					interests focused on human temperament rather than the detailed characteristics
					that make up a whole person. He was a biologist, and like others before him,
					notably the ancient Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, he believed that
					physiological factors account for temperament. Hippocrates had suggested that
					personality type arises from an excess or deficit of a particular type of bodily
					fluids, known as humors. Galen expanded upon this idea to suggest there are four
					types of temperament: sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. He
					claimed that sanguine people have an excess of blood, and are cheerful and
					optimistic. Those with a choleric temperament, stemming from an abundance of
					bile, are quick and hot-tempered. Phlegmatic individuals, with too much phlegm,
					are slow, lazy, and dull. Melancholics, who suffer from black bile, are sad,
					pessimistic, and depressed.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Galen’s biological approach appealed to Eysenck, who considered temperament to
					be physiological and genetically determined. He proposed a measure of two
					dimensions, or overarching “superfactors” of personality, that encompass all the
					detailed traits: Neuroticism and Extraversion&mdash;Introversion, which he then mapped
					against Galen’s four temperaments.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-890" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Eysenck’s scales</h2></div><p class="calibre14">“Neuroticism” was Eysenck’s name for a personality dimension that ranges from
					emotionally calm and stable at one extreme, to nervous and easily upset at the
					other. He claimed that neurotics (at the less stable end of the spectrum) have a
					low activation threshold in terms of triggering the sympathetic nervous system,
					which is the part of the brain that activates the “fight or flight” response.
					People with this more responsive system are hyperactive in this regard, so they
					respond to even minor threats as though they are seriously dangerous,
					experiencing an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, sweating, and so on.
					They are also more likely to suffer from the various neurotic disorders.
					However, Eysenck was not suggesting that people who scored at the nervous end of
					this dimension are necessarily neurotic in practice, merely that they would be
					more likely to develop a variety of nervous disorders. Eysenck’s second
					dimension of temperament was “Extraversion&mdash;Introversion.” He used these terms
					very much as we use them to describe people around us: extraverts are outgoing
					and talkative, while introverts are shy and quiet. Eysenck claimed that
					variations in brain activity explain the difference: introverts are chronically
					over-aroused and jittery, while extraverts are chronically under-aroused and
					bored; so the brain must either wake itself up through seeking further
					excitement with other people (extraverts) or calm itself down through seeking
					peace and solitude (introverts).</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-891"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000386.gif" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Eysenck’s model of personality</span> provides
							an overarching paradigm for defining temperament. Each of the
							superfactors (Extraversion and Neuroticism) is made up of lower-order
							habits, such as “ lively.” The two superfactors divide habits into four
							types that reflect Galen’s four temperaments.</p></div></div></div><div id="calibre_link-892" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Psychoticism</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Eysenck tested his ideas on large groups of people, but realized there were
					some sections of society that he was missing; so he took his studies into mental
					institutions. Through this work, he identified a third dimension of temperament,
					which he labeled “psychoticism,” a term that has largely replaced the word
					“insanity” in general use. In personality theory, this was quite a departure:
					most personality theorists were attempting to define and measure the normal
					(sane) personality. However, Eysenck said that, as with the neuroticism
					dimension, psychoticism ranges along a scale; his tests looked for the
					occurrence of personality traits commonly found among psychotics.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Eysenck found that a number of personality traits relate to each other to
					produce psychoticism; those who score highly on this scale are usually
					aggressive, egocentric, impersonal, impulsive, antisocial, unempathic, creative,
					and tough-minded. A high score on the scale does not mean a person is psychotic,
					and it is not inevitable that they will become so; they simply share
					characteristics with psychotic patients. In controlled studies, such as those by

					is broad agreement that it involves originality and novelty, and is based on
					aspects of both intellectual ability and personality. In his paper, <i class="calibre11">Creativity and Personality: Suggestions for a
						Theory</i>, Eysenck aimed to throw some light on the nature of
					creativity and its relationship to intelligence, personality, and genius.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Genius is held to be the highest form of creativity, and it rests upon very
					high intelligence: an IQ score of at least 165 is considered to be a
					prerequisite. However, a high IQ is not enough on its own. Another relevant
					component of intelligence is the mental search process which we use to find
					solutions, by bringing together different ideas from memory to form new answers
					to problems. This mental scanning is guided by ideas of relevance: what past
					ideas and experiences do I have that are relevant to this problem? Each of us
					performs this differently, and it is an ability that is independent of our IQ.
					The ability runs along a scale, ranging from an expansive, over-inclusive idea
					of what is relevant (seeing too many things as potential possibilities), to an
					overly narrow one (seeing few possibilities); at the center sits a more
					conventional sense of what might apply to any problem at hand.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over-inclusive thinking can be measured by word-association tests, which
					analyze two features: the number of responses to any given word, and the
					originality of responses. For example, when presented with the word “foot,”
					those with a narrow range of responses are most likely to respond with the word
					“shoe;” a slightly wider range of inclusive thinking might contain the words
					“hand” or “toe,” while an over-inclusive person might generate words such as
					“soldier” or “sore.” This kind of test makes it possible to measure people’s
					creativity.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the element of over-inclusive thinking that Eysenck demonstrated to be a
					common feature of both psychoticism and creativity. When over-inclusive thinking
					and high IQ are present together, creative genius will result, because the
					combination generates creative and original ideas. This is the cognitive
					characteristic that lies at the base of creativity. When over-inclusive thinking
					and psychotic symptoms are present together, psychosis, in varying degrees, may
					result.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-895"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000338.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Creative geniuses</span>, such as the artist

					potential for creative achievement, but the realization of that potential lies
					in the character trait of psychoticism (in the absence of psychosis). The drive
					to translate the trait of creativity into achievement, for example by creating
					works of art, comes from aspects of the psychotic temperament, in particular the
					over-inclusive thinking style. Eysenck was not suggesting a causal link between
					genius and insanity; while the two things have something in common&mdash;over-inclusive thinking&mdash;this combines with other features of genius or insanity
					to lead to very different results.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Research into creativity faces a number of difficult challenges: with some
					researchers claiming that creativity can only be judged on what it produces.
					Eysenck felt unable to propose a fully developed theory of creativity, only a
					suggestion for one. As he said, “I am linking several fuzzy theories.” His work
					ranged over many areas, though he is best known for his exploration into
					personality and intelligence. His PEN (Psychoticism, Extraversion, Neuroticism)
					model was hugely influential, and acted as the basis for much of the later
					research into personality traits.</p><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote2"><p class="calibre20">"Psychoticism in the absence of psychosis… is the vital element in

				not were usually based on educational achievement, and the results of personality
				and IQ tests. David C. McClelland, however, suggested that peoples’ motivations were
				the best predictor of success in the workplace. Through extensive research, he
				identified the three key motivations that he believed were responsible for job
				performance: the need for power, for achievement, and for affiliation. While
				everyone has all three motivations, he maintained that one would be dominant,
				shaping a person’s performance in the workplace.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-901"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000265.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-902" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Three key needs</h2></div><p class="calibre14">McClelland saw the need for power, or to have control over others, as the most
					important motivation for a good manager or leader. But this is only true as long
					as the need for power is on behalf of a company or an organization. Someone with
					a strong drive for personal power may make a poor team player.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;High quality work, McClelland thought, stems from the need for achievement,
					which is therefore a far more accurate predictor of job success than
					intelligence. The drive to achieve, he believed, is what gives people a
					competitive edge, helping them to stretch for new goals and improve.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, McClelland claimed that the need for affiliation&mdash;to have good
					relationships with others&mdash;helps people to work well within a team. He also noted
					that people with a pronounced need for affiliation are unlikely to be successful
					managers.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;McClelland pointed out that motivation stems from personality traits that are
					deeply embedded in the unconscious. We are not fully aware of our own
					motivations, he stated, so what we may say about our motives in job interviews
					or self-report questionnaires should not be taken at face value. He advocated
					using the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which psychologists Henry Murray and
					Christiana Morgan devised in the 1930s as a way of revealing aspects of the
					unconscious. Rarely used in a business setting, the test presents a series of
					pictures to the subject, who is then asked to develop a story based on them. The
					assumption is that the stories will be a projection of the subject’s underlying
					abilities and motivations. McClelland went on to devise an innovative way of
					analyzing TAT responses to allow a comparison between the suitability of the
					different people who took the test to specific work-related roles.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;McClelland’s ideas revolutionized business recruitment, and although his
					intensive methods of assessing job applicants have lost some of their
					popularity, the basic principles endure. Motivation is now seen as critical to
					performance at work.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-903"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000238.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">The Thematic Apperception Test</span> was

				interest. Evolutionary psychologists have also posed questions. What is the purpose
				of emotions? How have they helped us survive and thrive?</p><p class="calibre13">Nico Frijda’s groundbreaking book, <i class="calibre11">The Laws of
					Emotion</i>, explores the substance and rules of emotions. He sees them
				as lying at the crossroads of biological and cognitive processes: some, such as
				fear, are biologically inherent or innate, and these basic emotions are the ones we
				share with other animals. Others arise in us in response to thoughts, so are clearly
				cognition-based. They may even&mdash;as in the case of indignation or humiliation&mdash;be
				shaped by culture.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Frijda makes clear distinctions between emotions and feelings. Emotions are beyond
				our control; they spontaneously arise and alert us to their presence by physical
				sensations, such as a tightening in the gut when we feel fear. For this reason he
				says that “emotion is an essentially unconscious process.” Feelings, on the other
				hand, are our interpretations of whatever emotions we are experiencing, and have a
				more conscious element to them. When we feel something, we are able to have thoughts
				and make decisions about it. We are not suddenly hijacked by our feelings as we are
				by our emotions.</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-908"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000162.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-909" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Action and thought</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Frijda points out that emotions and feelings are also displayed differently.
					Emotions prepare us for action; in situations that induce fear, they are
					motivating forces that prepare the body to flee or stand and fight. Other people
					are able to understand, or at least guess at, our emotions from our behavior.
					Feelings, however, may or may not be consistent with behavior, because we can
					choose to behave in a way that hides them.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Frijda sees the basic emotions as an opportunity for greater self-awareness.
					They accompany a biological arousal that makes us notice them and become more
					aware of our feelings. This allows us to factor them into choices we make, and
					with honest reflection, to deepen self-awareness. But Frijda confines basic
					emotions to anger, joy, shame, sadness, and fear. Others, such as jealousy and
					guilt, do not have the same biological imperative.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;In defining and describing a very specific set of laws by which emotions
					operate, Frijda shows that they emerge, wax, and wane in a predictable way.
					Reason interprets them like a barometer, to ensure our mental well-being. “Our
					emotional selves and reasonable selves are not compartmentalized,” Frijda says,
					“on the contrary, they are connected much more than they seem.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-910"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000135.jpg" class="calibre8" /></span><div class="calibre7"><p class="calibre17"><span class="bold1">Emotions, such as fear</span>, Frijda says,

					how absurd it would be if people’s behavior appeared to be independent of
					external factors. He proposed that an analysis of a person’s behavior, in
					different situations, observed on numerous occasions, would provide clues to
					behavior patterns that would reveal a distinctive signature of personality, as
					opposed to a list of traits. Individual interpretation of a situation was also
					considered.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Mischel explored habits of thinking, which might endure over time and
					across different situations. In his famous marshmallow experiments, aimed at
					testing willpower, four-year-old children were presented with a single
					marshmallow and told they could either eat it immediately, or wait 20 minutes
					and then have two. Some children were able to wait, others were not. Mischel
					monitored each child’s progress into adolescence, and reported that those who
					had resisted temptation were better adjusted psychologically and more
					dependable; they did better at school, were more socially competent, and had
					greater self-esteem. Ability to delay gratification seemed to be a better
					predictor of future success than any previously measured trait.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mischel’s work led to a shift in the study of personality&mdash;from how personality
					predicts behavior to how behavior reveals personality. It also changed the way
					personality profiling is used in assessing job candidates. Tests that were once
					considered an accurate basis for staff recruitment are now seen as a guide, to
					be interpreted in the context of the situations that are likely to arise in

				fundamental beliefs by a number of experts known as the “anti-psychiatrists.” This
				informal group of psychiatrists, psychologists, and welfare workers claimed that
				psychiatry is a medical model of mental health, yet there are no physical symptoms,
				and its treatment regimes largely ignore the patient’s needs and behaviors.</p><p class="calibre13">In 1973, David Rosenhan carried out a field study in the US that explored the
				validity of psychiatric diagnosis and resulted in the dramatic conclusion that we
				cannot distinguish the sane from the insane in psychiatric hospitals.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first part of the study, Rosenhan assembled a group of eight sane people
				(including himself), made up of women and men of different occupations and ages, and
				designated them as pseudo-patients. They were briefed to make an attempt to be
				admitted as patients to different mental hospitals in five US states, first by
				telephoning the hospital to ask for an appointment. Later, at the admissions office,
				they were to complain of hearing an unfamiliar voice in their heads, which was
				unclear but used words such as “empty” and “thud.” This suggested existential
				feelings of pointlessness. They were instructed to give false names and occupations,
				but otherwise true personal histories.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, all the pseudo-patients were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of
				schizophrenia, despite showing no symptoms of the disorder. Their hospital stays
				lasted an average of 19 days, during which time they behaved completely normally.
				They maintained journals of their experiences, surreptitiously at first but then
				openly, as it was never questioned. Demonstrating how even normal behavior might be
				interpreted as evidence of a psychiatric condition, Rosenhan found that a common
				comment in their medical notes was “patient engages in writing behavior.”</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;The “patients” themselves described their experience in hospital as one of
				depersonalization and powerlessness. Their records showed that the average daily
				time they spent with medical staff was less than seven minutes. Although they were
				undetected by the hospital staff, other patients challenged their sanity, sometimes
				quite vigorously: “You’re not crazy. You’re a journalist checking up on the
				hospital.”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-922"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000367.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div id="calibre_link-923" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Judging the insane sane</h2></div><p class="calibre14">In the second part of Rosenhan’s study, he falsely informed the staff at a
					teaching and research hospital (who were aware of the first study) that during
					the next three months, one or more pseudo-patients would try to be admitted to
					the hospital, and they were asked to rate each new patient on the likelihood of
					them being a pseudo-patient. Of 193 genuine new admissions, 41 were judged
					suspect by at least one member of staff, and 23 were flagged as possible
					pseudo-patients by at least one psychiatrist.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosenhan’s work generated an explosion of controversy, and led many
					institutions to take steps to improve their care of patients.</p></div><div class="section_feature3" id="calibre_link-924"><h4 class="lh1_rule_black">DAVID ROSENHAN</h4><div class="introimg" id="calibre_link-925"><img alt="" src="images/000405.jpg" class="calibre18" /></div><p class="calibre10">David Rosenhan was born in the US in 1932.

				appears to present as two or more distinct identities. MPD was first reported in
				1791 by Eberhardt Gmelin; over the following 150 years, a further 100 clinical cases
				were documented. It was believed that the condition arose from childhood abuse, and
				could be cured by integrating the sub-personalities back into the main
				personality.</p><p class="calibre13">One of the most famous cases of multiple personality disorder is that of Eve
				White. Eve was referred to Thigpen and Cleckley in 1952, suffering from severe
				headaches and occasional blackouts. She was a neat, rather prim, young woman, aged
				25, married, with a four-year-old daughter. Eve would remain in treatment for 14
				months.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve described to the doctors a disturbing episode: she had bought some extravagant
				clothes she could not afford, yet had no memory of the purchase. As she recounted
				this, her demeanor began to change. She looked confused, then the lines of her face
				altered. Her eyes widened, and she smiled provocatively. She spoke in a bright,
				flirtatious tone, requesting a cigarette, even though Eve did not smoke.</p><p class="calibre13">&nbsp;&nbsp;This was “Eve Black,” a separate personality so distinct that she even suffered
				from a skin allergy to nylon that Eve White did not. Eve White was unaware of Eve
				Black, while the latter was wholly aware of the former, and was full of derision for
				her: “She’s such a damn dope….”</p><div class="mediaobject" id="calibre_link-928"><span><img alt="RG" src="images/000297.gif" class="calibre8" /></span></div><div class="calibre7"><div class="blockquote3"><p class="calibre20">"‘When I go out and get drunk,’ Eve Black said, ‘<i class="calibre11">she</i> wakes up with the hangover.’"</p><div class="attribution"><p class="pbold1">Thigpen &amp; Cleckley</p></div></div></div><div class="calibre9"></div><div id="calibre_link-929" class="calibre7"><div class="calibre7"><h2 class="heading_h">Distinct personalities</h2></div><p class="calibre14">Both personalities were submitted to extensive psychological testing.

					White had a marginally higher IQ than Eve Black; both fell in the “bright,
					normal” category. Personality dynamics were explored using the Rorschach test
					(in which subjects report their perception of inkblots). There were dramatic
					differences: Eve Black showed a dominant hysterical tendency, and the ability to
					conform. Eve White showed “constriction, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive
					traits” and an inability to deal with her hostility.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve’s condition was believed to result from childhood abuse, so efforts were
					made to work back into her early childhood, using hypnosis to provoke the
					emergence of Eve Black. Eventually, an attempt was made to summon both
					personalities at once; Eve fell into a trance. She woke as a third personality:
					this was Jane, the third face of Eve&mdash;a more capable and interesting character
					than Eve White. She seemed to combine the assets of both Eves, without their
					weaknesses. While neither Eve was aware of Jane, she was aware of them
					both.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane appeared to be a balanced compromise between the two Eves, and she was
					nurtured as the personality with the best grasp of the complex dynamics of the
					three personalities: the two Eves were integrated into her character.</p><p class="calibre14">&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-blown cases of MPD such as Eve’s are rare, but it is now thought that
					less pronounced cases are more common. The careful documentation of in-depth
					case studies like Eve’s has resulted in diagnostic and treatment protocols that
